Today, on my way to a fishing trip, I hit a nice stretch of road and got up to 130 mph (not bragging, just mentioning anything that might be relevant). Everything was running smoothly. I parked my car and went on my trip.

When I came back and started leaving the parking lot, I noticed that between 1,400–2,200 RPM, there was a bizarre rattling sound. It seems to be coming from the backside of the engine or right around the front wheels area but towards the engine. The sound is like shaking a Coke can with a few metal BBs in it, and rattling it at random intervals.

So I began investigating, and here’s what I’ve noted:

* It only makes the noise in 2nd gear, and not in any other gears (or at least I can’t hear it in other gears due to wind noise).
* It does not make the noise in park, neutral, or reverse.
* The sound only really happens around 18–30 mph, which makes me think it could be 2nd gear-related.
* I’m also wondering if maybe one of the metal brake shields (the thin metal covers behind the brake rotors) is rubbing or loose.
* I recently switched to a more premium oil (Royal Purple), though I’m not sure if that would cause this.
* It might also be due to me putting off a transmission flush—maybe it’s catching up to me now.

Hopefully you are bleeding the brakes every time you work on brakes. You didnt state that you are and that is essential. If you havent been bleeding brakes you definitely have air in the brakes and that may be your problem. If the brakes arent bled the caliper isnt going to work and eventually you will ruin the caliper piston because it gets stuck in one place eventually because it isnt moving with air in the brakes. Not to mention its also dangerous not bleeding the brakes.
Also that rotor looks like it needs changed. So buy a new caliper and rotor."

Now, when I bought my car in 2021 the A/C ran good, but over the years it's slowly been taking longer and longer to start blowing cold air and now it's at a point where it just doesn't blow cold air.
Some symptoms I've noticed in the past year-
-Bubbling noises under the dash
-Progressively taking longer for the AC to get cold. (Went from 10-15 mins of driving to get cold, to 30 and now it never gets cold)
-Sometimes I'll hear a ""clicking"" noise under the dash, I'm thinking this is the compressor trying to switch on, then stopping itself when it realizes it doesnt have enough pressure?

Now I get it- recharging it wont fix it forever, but I just need a recharge/fix to last me for a month or two before I move back in with my parents.

I'm looking at buying a gauge and a bottle of refrigerant (WITHOUT any type of stop leak added to it)

1m9xyvf,Seeking advice on how to do maintenance when I don’t know what to look for,"I have a 2016 mazda3 GS hatchback. Car has 180k kms (112k miles) and I drive approx 50kms (30 mi) a day. 

My goal is to know what to do when, which is easy for consumables, but it’s other stuff that I don’t know how to plan for. 

When I bought my car I signed up for “free oil changes for life” and it has paid for itself many times over. My dealer has since been bought out and while they will still honor the deal, it now comes with the stipulation that I do ALL recommended maintenance with them which is not going to happen. 

I relied on these oil changes to let me know what services need to be done in order to maintain my car - they diagnose and I do the repairs myself. Now, besides checking brakes and my CV axles, I wouldn’t know a damn thing about what to look for. 

Can I just buy an inspection from an Indy every 6-12 months to determine what I need to do? AAA has inspection pkgs for $180-250 which is reasonable but I don’t wanna do that more than once a year and I’m not sure if that’s a reasonable interval.

1m9x99v,"09 Dodge Ram, intermittently the truck won't move forward unless it's in 4wd low. What could this be? ESP/BAS light lit up last week.","
2009 Dodge Ram 4.7L 
111,000 miles

A couple weeks ago the 4x4 was engaged for a short time in soft grass and then after disengagement the ESP/BAS light illuminated and stayed on. Truck felt and drove normal but was taken to a local garage and the code was cleared and the light went off. The guy at the garage said it was kinda ""above his head"" and he was unwilling to do anything further. It's been okay since then.  

Today someone borrowed the truck to move furniture. They reversed into their driveway, put on the emergency brake, and when they got back in to leave,  the truck would not move forward. E-Brake was off and engine revved but truck would not move forward. The only way to get it to move forward was to put it in 4wd Low. If you cut off 4wd low, the truck went back to revving and not moving forward. We loaded it onto a car hauler on 4wd low, then disengaged 4wd and hauled it about 15 miles to a different local garage. While unloading it, the truck drove forward perfectly fine without having to be in 4wd low. Maybe the ride jiggled something?

We called the closest Dodge dealer to see if we could get an appointment and their service department said we don't even know if our computers will run Diagnostic on a truck that old and we don't know if we can get parts for one that old if it needs something.

It is possible that the connectors contribute to the misfires.  I don't think I'm seeing corrosion in your pictures.  It looks more like RTV.  RTV and zip ties are common ways of dealing with broken latches, and it usually works fine, as long as the actual conductor pins and sockets are making good contact.  You could clean those connection points and put them back together with RTV and/or zip ties, except for #2.  They'll probably hold fine until the next time you take them apart.  If it works it works.

You do need to replace the broken connector on #2, and dig that broken piece out of the coil with a pick. You can get replacement connectors from your local parts stores and online sites like RockAuto and A1 Auto.  Sometimes the kits come with the insulated, water proof splice connectors you need, or you might have to buy them separately, and you'll need a stripping/crimping tool.

SatansWarrior69 (Score: 1): Left hand extractor drill bits might remove it. They are made to extract bolts. You use the drill bits in the set to make a hole in the center of the broken bolt then switch to the the extractor bolts to try to remove the bolt. They work in reverse with the drill. 

Id suggest getting a Chrome Molybdenum set. They cost more though. Cobalt tends to break a lot easier. The cheap sets are usually all cobalt.  You shouldnt use regular drill bits they arent really made for drilling out bolts. 

Extractor bits can still break in the broken bolts at times. You start off small and work your way up to a larger bits. If you do it right and some luck you can just literally unscrew the broken bolt. Its also possible an extractor bolt can be broken off in the broken bolt even if you do it right but there is less of a chance if its done right. If that happens its a real hassle to remove them because the extractor bits are much harder. There are videos that will help you do it properly. If you keep the drill bits cool theres less chance of breaking them.

 Or instead you can just drill out the broken bolt completely then rethread it.

When you buy extractor sets Ive learned hard way its best to have 2 or 3 extractor sets on hand because the drill bits wear out from drilling through metal and break at times even if they dont get stuck when break. If one breaks and you only had one set and dont have the size you need you have to hope its during business hours so you can go buy what you then need. Anyway best to just get at least two sets to start.

If you use cutting oil with the extractor bits there is less chance of breaking them."

After the car has been powered off for at least 10 mins (I like to wait 20-30 to be safe) you need to measure the car. You want to see something under around 50-100 mA (milli-amps).

2A15 and EVAP leak are either a worn gas cap seal or the the leak detection pump on its way out. 

2ACC I bet has been there for some time: it's the DME main relay, which on E90LCI is integrated in the junction box. The junction box needs to be replaced as a whole (even if you can do advanced repairs such as this the relays are hard to find) and this is usually done when the car starts having issues starting. 

Throttle pedal module needs diagnostics but I wouldn't be too surprised it was waterlogged at some point and now the bill has arrived.

Typically a wheel cylinder is held on by 2 bolts into the backing plate. You also need to remove the brake line as it is attached to the wheel cylinder.  Don’t need to open the old bleed screw. Use a tubing wrench instead of a regular open end wrench so you don’t round the nut of the flare fitting. 

Take pictures because you will more than likely have to disconnect the brake shoes and springs. 

Wheel cylinders are about $10-$15 and there are LEFT and RIGHT sides sometimes. The bleed screw has to be on top or the upper side.

1m9gzdr,Dodge ticking sound,"2015 Dodge Journey, 98,000 miles. No CEL

My car has always had a ticking engine noise at idle since I bought it about 5 years ago. A few friends have mentioned it over the years and said it was a bad lifter. 

I took my car in to a mechanic today for a squeaky sound when I go over speed bumps and they mentioned the ticking noise. They want to replace upper intake and valve cover gaskets for about $700. Then they said they will inspect the cams and see if they are bad. And if they are bad it might cost an additional $3k to replace them.

What is weird is that about 6 months ago I had taken my car to a different mechanic because it was leaking oil and they said it was my valve cover gasket. I then took it to this new mechanic (same one from today) for a second opinion and they said the first mechanic was wrong-it was my oil cooler (which I paid them to replace and no more leaks on the driveway).

Does this sound right? She made it sound very catastrophic for my car.

1m9g42i,S65 Misfire with cutoff on one cylinder,"Hi all,

I originally had a misfire with cutoff on cylinder 6 of an S65 engine. I took the car to my indie and they diagnosed a bad plug on 6 (which I confirmed), they replaced all 8.

As soon as I picked the car up I got an engine malfunction warning. This time misfire on cylinder 1. As we originally suspected a bad ignition coil and me thinking when the indie put everything back they may have swapped coil 6 with coil 1, I decided to put in a new coil on 1. Cleared the codes, started the car and it ran a little rough on start but was able to drive home 17km away.

Started the car the next day and again, misfire on 1. I pulled the plugs from cyl 1 and 2, these are the photos. The dirty one is the misfire and the clean is cyl 2.

I pulled the plug again, cleaned the oil off, tried to clean inside the well as much as I could, reinstalled - misfire on cyl 1 again.

My questions:

1. What could cause cyl 1 to misfire when it was ok prior to pulling out the old spark plug?
- - my though is the valve covers gaskets were slowly going bad and the act of pulling the plug has created a leak.

2. What would deposit that much oil on a brand new plug threads on a 17km trip?

3. Could this really be a valve cover/valve cover gasket/spark plug tube issue?
- - I only have a single cylinder misfire code and nothing else. There is only oil on the threads of the spark plug, I couldn’t see much or anything in the well. Used endoscope into the cylinder and couldn’t see any oil, scoring or excess fuel in there. 

Hoping for ideas before I spend thousands on dollars on new parts. TIA!!",1,1753491197.0,2,MechanicAdvice,1753643892,2025-07-26 00:53:17,2025-07-27 19:18:12,"ibirate (Score: 1): Car is a 2011 BMW M3 btw, to align to posting rules."

My questions are:

1. since cylinder 8 is the hardest to get to &amp; work will be done to get to it &amp; replace it, should I take this time to also change out the other hard-to-get-to cylinders (ie; the furthest 4x cylinders in the back), along with 2x new spark plugs for each or just change the 1x that is giving me the misfire?
2. in the southern US, what is a typical job/labor pricing for replacing the coil(s)? (ie; a single coil &amp; pair of spark plug VS more than one cylinder)
3. if I bring my own parts, does that usually keep cost down?
4. if anybody cares to give these a look, will these replacement coils &amp; plugs work with my 5.7L V8 Ram 1500? I don't entirely trust online sites to make sure parts fit or how to tell quality coils from cheap knock offs, etc. I have no idea what brand/type of coils &amp; plugs im using now are &amp; don't feel comfortable attempting to check for myself.

You can probably find some Dodge dealer parts sites online with the lowest prices for Mopar.  RockAuto lists Mopar parts.  Amazon and eBay have had some problems with counterfeit parts.

2. No typical, it's always going to vary.  Dealerships are usually highest, chain shops next, then independents and mobile, but even that's not a hard rule.  It's ok to ask up front for the price before you agree to any work.

3. A lot of shops won't even accept customer provided parts, but you can ask.  If they do, they might pad the labor rate to make up for the lack of parts mark-up.  Mobile mechanics are usually more receptive to customer provided parts.

4. Those Amazon coils are no-brand cheap coils and will give you problems.  Coils are not a wear item.  Only replace the bad ones, and go with Mopar or, if you can find out who made the coils for Dodge, that brand.  It's probably Denso, or NTK.  

The coil plug boots are a wear item and should be replaced when replacing spark plugs.  Coil plug boots are available as single units, and multi-packs up to 16.  I would go with Denso or NTK.

Usually it's a broken accessory belt or bad alternator. You didn't mention it overheating, which makes it point more toward the alternator. So when there's no electricity flowing from the alternator, the battery is providing it, and modern cars need a lot of electrical power. After a while the battery becomes depleted, and even if the engine is still running, other systems may have already shut down. Like the transmission control module, and then the engine.

The next step is to get the battery charged. Also see if the accessory belt is still present. If you don't have a charger, most parts stores can charge it for you, usually for free. Then diagnose the alternator. You can chance driving it after you get the battery fully charged but only if the belt is still there to run the water pump. I would keep that as short as possible, and tow it if it needs to move more than about about 10 miles.

1m9em8l,07 F150 4x4 Problem Help,"Hey folks, Im lost on this one.

Before you say its the vacuum hubs, I'm almost certain they aren't the reaso9n... I've disconnected the vacuum lines. I did swap the hubs like 8 years ago also, not that that means they cant be bad.

So the problem exists when I am in 2 wheel drive, not all the time while moving, usually when applying power, there is a chain like ratcheting noise, as soon as I pop it into 4x4 the sound goes away. However, I have no power to the front wheels, I can tell, when turning tightly right I have no resistance. 

Ive looked under the truck while my brother-in-law moved it forward and backward while in 2x4 and the front transfer output shaft is turning, as well as the CV shafts... so I'm lost as to why the shafts are turning and I have this noise. The noise almost sounds like bad hubs, but they seem to be connected to the shafts.

My theories are:

1. Something wrong with the transfer case
2. One of two vacuum hubs are gone
3. Vacuum lines do more than just the hubs and im not aware they always need to be connected

 this tests the A wiring from the starter relay B+ ... this tests the Field wire to the alternator brush.. causing the alternator to FULL FIELD.. this is only a few seconds.. no more than 5 or 7 seconds.. you should see the voltage getting to the battery getting close to 15 volts.. do not let it exceed 15 volts please..

 next.. move the multimeter to Negative battery post and wedge the positive post into the back of the S terminal on the regulator pigtail connector..  set the meter to AC Volts.. yes AC.. 

 the engine is still idling..Jump the A and F terminal again.. if you are getting close to 15 volts like before. this time you should see just over 7 volts AC on the S wire ... 

  you should also set the meter back to 20 volts DC.. clip to the alternator output stud.. and the positive battery post.. with the alternator max fielding.. Jumping A and F again.. how many tenths of a volt do you have..  should not be over 3/10ths.. or 0.3 vdc..  again. this is only a few seconds.. 

  test light or multimeter set to 20 volt DC.. engine off.. what happens to the I wire when you turn the key on..  you should see voltage.. 

 the I terminal wire comes from the Alternator lamp . the other side of the alternator lamp is powered thru the gauge fuse.. and that gets switched power from the ignition switches.. without this working.. you will not have a working charging system.. it turns the regulator on..


 the A wire is constant battery voltage on cars/trucks with Alternator lamps.. its different with amp meter cars and trucks..

 the S wire is tied to the Alternator stator windings.. the external alternator windings. the other end of the same windings are connected to positive and negative diodes.. so if you monitor the S voltage.. it will have Half the alternator output only when the system is charging.. it also is used to power the choke thermostats.. 

 the. F wire is pulsed positive and negative fast thru the voltage regulator.. when its pulsed positive the power goes thru the Field connection which is a brush to the slip ring. the other brush is grounded..  this increases the magnetic field of the spinning rotor.. as the regulator switches to the negative on the field. the magnetic field is decreased..  so its going on off on off on off on off.. many times a second.  the AC voltage from the stator circuit allows the voltage regulator to sync with the alternator speed changes.."

1m9cvql,Replacing brakes and rotors,"I find myself in a bit of a situation and could use some advice. I don’t have any auto mechanic experience, but I need to replace the front and rear brakes and rotors on my 2016 Mazda CX-5 Sport. The auto shop quoted me $1300 for the job, and honestly, I just don’t have that kind of money right now. When I found out the parts—brake pads and rotors—only cost $300, I figured I’d give it a shot myself. Not only could I save a ton, but it seems like a handy skill to pick up for the future to keep costs down. I’d really appreciate any guidance you can offer on tools I’ll need, additional materials to get, and any tips from someone who’s done this a lot to make it easier for a beginner like me. Here’s what I’ve got so far, and I’m hoping you can help fill in the gaps!

Since I’m starting from zero, I know I’ll need to gather some tools. Based on what I’ve researched, here’s what seems essential for the job:

Tools I’ll Need
- **Jack and Jack Stands**: To lift the car and hold it up safely while I work. I’ve read it’s dangerous to rely on just a jack.
- **Lug Wrench or Impact Wrench**: To get the wheel lug nuts off. I’m guessing my car came with a basic lug wrench, but an impact wrench might speed things up.
- **C-Clamp or Brake Caliper Tool**: To push the brake caliper piston back in when I put the new pads on.
- **Torque Wrench**: To tighten the lug nuts and caliper bolts just right—apparently, there’s a specific torque spec for safety.
- **Basic Hand Tools**: Stuff like wrenches, sockets, and screwdrivers to take things apart and put them back together.

Do you think that covers it, or am I missing something key? I’ve also heard about a brake bleeder kit, but I’m not sure if I’ll need it for a basic pad and rotor swap—any thoughts?

Additional Materials
Beyond the brake pads and rotors (which I’ve already got for my Mazda), I’m wondering what else I should pick up. Here’s what I’m thinking:
- **Brake Cleaner**: To clean off the new rotors and other parts so there’s no gunk messing things up.
- **Anti-Seize Lubricant**: For the caliper bolts, to keep them from getting stuck down the road.
- **Brake Grease**: Maybe for the caliper slides or pad backs? I’m not sure if my car needs it—do you know?

Anything else you’d recommend picking up at the auto store to make this go smoothly?

Tips to Make It Easier
Since I’ve never done this before, I’m a little nervous, especially because brakes are so important for safety. If you’ve got experience with brake jobs, I’d love any tricks or advice to help me out. Here’s what I’ve gathered so far:
1. **Safety First**: Use jack stands and never trust just the jack to hold the car up.
2. **One Wheel at a Time**: Work on one side and leave the other intact so I can peek at it if I forget how things fit.
3. **Take Pictures**: Snap some shots as I go so I can remember what goes where when it’s time to reassemble.
4. **Keep It Clean**: Don’t get grease or oil on the pads or rotors—it could mess up how they work.
5. **Bed the Pads**: I read I need to do some special driving after to “bed in” the new pads—any tips on that?
6. **Look It Up**: If I get stuck, find a manual or video for my 2016 Mazda CX-5 Sport.

Does that sound like a solid plan? Anything you’d add or warn me about? I’m trying to be careful since this is my first go, and I don’t want to mess up something as critical as brakes.

I really appreciate any help you can give. Saving over $1000 is a huge motivator, but I want to do this right. If you’ve got any favorite resources—like a good YouTube channel for Mazda brake jobs—or stories from your own brake swaps, I’m all ears.

Also when you are retracting the piston, make sure to take the cap off the brake master cylinder and watch the level, it will go up as you push the piston back and can make a mess if it overflows.

Unless you open up the brake system, you generally wont need a brake bleeder.  By open up I mean disconnect a brake fluid line."

Even a small leak can allow water to accumulate over time. If it seems excessive you might try figuring out where it is coming it by looking for pooling water, check door panel fabric and low areas. Also look for slight white discolorations like of like the ones you see in the shower as this might be where it's getting in. I might check the drivers window first, as your electrical issue could have been caused by water getting in.

It's it's minor you can run the heater and AC and the same time from time to time. This dehumidifies quickly. A few years back I ended up buying a large bag of desiccant, putting it in a pot, and having it collect water. When it changed color I'd put it in the over to recharge it. This helped too."

1ma3vmk,"“Cabin air filter” issue, 2010 Honda Pilot","I clicked “Air Conditioning” as my flair because that seems closest.

Backstory:  I am handy in a fix your house way but not in a fix your car way.   I really don’t know how cars/SUVs work but with some instructions… I am sure that I could figure it and do many repairs on my own.

Anyway, I own a 2010 Honda Pilot.  It has had a long and glorious life but it is near its end.  It is not worth much but it does a really nice job whenever I need an SUV for towing or transporting large items.  I drive it less than 1500 miles per year.  I have kept it parked in garage the last five winters, using it not at all.  I have slacked on general/routine maintenance.

Last year, I think, it started smelling really badly.  I assumed one my kids spilled some nasty smelling liquid that is used with fake fishing bait (we fish a good amount).  The smell is virtually identical.   However, last week, my son and I were using the vehicle and he turned off the air blower and the smell went away.

So, I got to thinking… maybe I should change the cabin air filter?  I had no idea how to do that, but through a combination of Google and Youtube, I learned how. 

I discovered that my cabin air filter needed to be replaced as much as any cabin air filter in the history of cabin air filters.  I also am now certain the source of the odor was the air filter, not a spill. I have attached a photo for “fun”.  I also removed a volleyball-sized amount of material that clearly indicates that a mouse or other small rodent had made a winter home in my vehicle.

So, my question:

Other than removing the volleyball and replacing the air filter, is there anything else that I should be doing to clean out the system so to speak?

Keep in mind that the rougher grit sandpaper is more aggressive than the finer grit - you have to spend more time with the finer grit to remove the scratches from the coarse grit sanding. 

Your goal when moving up to the finer grits is to remove ALL of the scratches from the lower grit. Each time you step up to a finer grit you should see less and less scratches until its just an even “frosted glass” look. Then you’re ready to polish. 

It might take a lot longer at each finer grit sandpaper than you expect. Use medium to light pressure and spray with water to lubricate. 

It should look totally clear before you put on the clear coat, and apply the clear coat in multiple light coats so it doesn’t run. 

Also idk if this is right or wrong, but I would personally do swirls and not straight lines. I can’t really say why, but i feel like it would be easier to remove scratches if they’re not all parallel grooves

1m9ev1h,Guide to engine running problems from a novice engineer,"Here's a quick little excerpt to diagnose engine problems I wrote up from scratch using memory. I would ask that anyone with input on my guide do so in a respectful manner, as there's probably bound to be a few errors in here somewhere. If I got anything wrong I asked that you kindly let me know so that I may fix it. 

Also, if it helps, I posted this as a comment on someone else's post in order to help them diagnose their engine problems

There are five main factors to make sure a combustion engine runs:

1. Air.

2. Fuel.

3. Timing.

4. Compression.

5. Spark (N/A if Diesel/Nitromethane).


Start by making sure the car is getting the right amount of air. Too little, and she'll run rich, which is what cars do when they need to heat up anyways. Too much air, and you're running lean which can cause issues with idle. To fix a lean issue, you have to find a vacuum leak somewhere. The easiest way to do this (as long as you don't have a MAF/MAP sensor in the way) is to spray something flammable near the airbox and listening for a raise in RPM. You don't want to spray it near the sensor in order to keep it clean. From this point, you can patch the crack in your airbox if there is one.

Fuel is another important component. When compared to air, too much fuel is rich and too little fuel is lean. One of the most common culprits to a fuel issue is generally the fuel pump. If your car can't get any fuel in, it will not run as air itself cannot burn. Weak / faulty fuel pumps can also be a problem if there's not enough fuel going in. There's also the slightly more rare issue of clogged fuel lines or fuel filters sometimes. On carbureted vehicles it can often be caused by using ethanol fuel, creating some type of ethanol gel in the Jets. They would need to be cleaned out.


Timing simply refers to the manner in which air, fuel, compression and spark (if applicable) are happening. Much like with air and fuel, you can run slightly different timing profiles however there is a certain range in which you can have it properly operate. If your engine for example skips a timing gear tooth or 2, you will not have your engine run right if at all. Easiest way to diagnose this is to take apart the belts and make sure that everything is at top dead center and then realigning.

Compression is necessary in order to create torque in an engine. Without torque, your piston would not move at all despite actually burning the fuel. Have you ever tried to inflate a basketball and notice a measurement like PSI or BAR? It's simply a measurement of how much air is actually compressed. These are also commonly used measurements for compression testing on engines. A common culprit for a failing compression test is usually the valves, but it could also be a head gasket, bad valve springs and/or piston rings. If you have failing compression in your engine, it's generally a pretty expensive fix to go get done somewhere. It could involve something as severe as resurfacing the head and block, or as simple as changing the valve springs.

To finalize, there is Spark. Spark is only applicable in engines that do not have compression-ignition. Basically every engine out there that doesn't run diesel or nitromethane will need spark. Obviously the most common one is one that runs on gasoline (petrol for other countries). The most common cause of a spark issue is usually speaking the plugs, though I have often found while working in auto parts stores that the coils are a very common culprit as well. A common way to diagnose spark issues is by feeling for the engine's responses. Typically, you will find that if it's a near instantaneous cut off and on, it's generally spark related.

1m9cudp,Replacing Brakes and Rotors,"I find myself in a bit of a situation and could use some advice. I don’t have any auto mechanic experience, but I need to replace the front and rear brakes and rotors on my 2016 Mazda CX-5 Sport. The auto shop quoted me $1300 for the job, and honestly, I just don’t have that kind of money right now. When I found out the parts—brake pads and rotors—only cost $300, I figured I’d give it a shot myself. Not only could I save a ton, but it seems like a handy skill to pick up for the future to keep costs down. I’d really appreciate any guidance you can offer on tools I’ll need, additional materials to get, and any tips from someone who’s done this a lot to make it easier for a beginner like me. Here’s what I’ve got so far, and I’m hoping you can help fill in the gaps!

Since I’m starting from zero, I know I’ll need to gather some tools. Based on what I’ve researched, here’s what seems essential for the job:

Tools I’ll Need
- **Jack and Jack Stands**: To lift the car and hold it up safely while I work. I’ve read it’s dangerous to rely on just a jack.
- **Lug Wrench or Impact Wrench**: To get the wheel lug nuts off. I’m guessing my car came with a basic lug wrench, but an impact wrench might speed things up.
- **C-Clamp or Brake Caliper Tool**: To push the brake caliper piston back in when I put the new pads on.
- **Torque Wrench**: To tighten the lug nuts and caliper bolts just right—apparently, there’s a specific torque spec for safety.
- **Basic Hand Tools**: Stuff like wrenches, sockets, and screwdrivers to take things apart and put them back together.

Do you think that covers it, or am I missing something key? I’ve also heard about a brake bleeder kit, but I’m not sure if I’ll need it for a basic pad and rotor swap—any thoughts?

Additional Materials
Beyond the brake pads and rotors (which I’ve already got for my Mazda), I’m wondering what else I should pick up. Here’s what I’m thinking:
- **Brake Cleaner**: To clean off the new rotors and other parts so there’s no gunk messing things up.
- **Anti-Seize Lubricant**: For the caliper bolts, to keep them from getting stuck down the road.
- **Brake Grease**: Maybe for the caliper slides or pad backs? I’m not sure if my car needs it—do you know?

Anything else you’d recommend picking up at the auto store to make this go smoothly?

Tips to Make It Easier
Since I’ve never done this before, I’m a little nervous, especially because brakes are so important for safety. If you’ve got experience with brake jobs, I’d love any tricks or advice to help me out. Here’s what I’ve gathered so far:
1. **Safety First**: Use jack stands and never trust just the jack to hold the car up.
2. **One Wheel at a Time**: Work on one side and leave the other intact so I can peek at it if I forget how things fit.
3. **Take Pictures**: Snap some shots as I go so I can remember what goes where when it’s time to reassemble.
4. **Keep It Clean**: Don’t get grease or oil on the pads or rotors—it could mess up how they work.
5. **Bed the Pads**: I read I need to do some special driving after to “bed in” the new pads—any tips on that?
6. **Look It Up**: If I get stuck, find a manual or video for my 2016 Mazda CX-5 Sport.

Does that sound like a solid plan? Anything you’d add or warn me about? I’m trying to be careful since this is my first go, and I don’t want to mess up something as critical as brakes.

I really appreciate any help you can give. Saving over $1000 is a huge motivator, but I want to do this right.

1m9cm6n,Dodge lifter ticking,"2015 Dodge Journey, 98,000 miles 

My car has always had a ticking engine noise at idle since I bought it about 5 years ago. A few friends have mentioned it over the years and said it was a bad lifter. 

I took my car in to a mechanic today for a squeaky sound when I go over speed bumps and they mentioned the ticking noise. They want to replace upper intake and valve cover gaskets. Then they said they will inspect the cams and see if they are bad. And if they are bad it might cost about $3k to replace them.

What is weird is that about 6 months ago I had taken my car to a different mechanic because it was leaking oil and they said it was my valve cover gasket. I then took it to this new mechanic (same one from today) for a second opinion and they said the first mechanic was wrong-it was my oil cooler (which I paid them to replace and no more leaks on the driveway).

Does this sound right? She made it sound very catastrophic for my car.

Thank you!

After driving (especially in Dynamic mode), the engine sounds normal and smooth. But if I turn it off for 30–40 minutes and restart, there’s a distinct ticking/clattering sound from the top of the engine (sounds like hydraulic lifters). This ticking does not disappear even after 20 minutes of idling/driving.

On a cold start, the engine is quiet with no ticking. Fresh oil (Liqui Moly Top Tec 4200 5W-30) and a Mann filter. The previous oil ran for 5,000 km with no oil consumption (level stayed slightly above max the entire time).

Power delivery, fuel consumption, and exhaust are all normal, and no error codes are present.

If its the same, i would either check the lifters or change the oil viscosity, i think 5w40 will outperform the 5w30 when hot and i think it wont affect that engine in a bad way. Although thats potentially 3 oil changes so maybe get the lifters looked at, shouldnt be that much of a job.

_Thorshammer_ (Score: 2): Not an easy question to answer, so let's do some math and then look at options to help you decide what's best for you.

Let's say under your current program you buy a $2000 car.

Then you spend $1000 keeping it on the road for 18 months.

Excluding consumables, insurance, gas, etc, simply keeping a car on the road costs you about $165 a month.

You don't always spend that money every month - most months you spend nothing because your costs are mostly purchase and small repairs before you get rid of the car - but you basically have a $165 / month car payment.

Now, let's extend that car payment out 5 years - you are basically buying $10,000 worth of car and car repair every 5 years.

Here's the question - if you bought and made payments on a more expensive car, would that more expensive car last longer OR make your life easier?

Because of the way interest works and the fact you would need full coverage, you would actually be buying a $6,000 or $7,000 car.

Is a $6,000 car going to last longer than a $2,000 car? Probably.

3.5 years longer? Maybe, maybe not, but it should last longer than 18 months.

The problem here is that if you start making actual payments on a car and it fails you're then in a position where you still owe on one car and you're forced to buy another.

That can lead to a downward spiral of debt because you keep getting further and further behind.

Here is my free advice - I would keep buying junk until you've saved enough to buy a car that will almost certainly last 5 years for your $165 / month.

Save up $3,000 or $4,000 and buy a decent used $11,000 Corolla or Civic - something that should be both cheap to own / run and last well beyond the 5 year loan so you can keep getting ahead.

I'm happy to discuss more if you think my advice is helpful.

It's a very involved story but it goes all the way back to the 1970s when General Motors had extreme difficulties constructing economical cars for the North American market. This culminated into GM and Toyota collaborating to built the NUMMI plant in California. The first car I owned was a 1987 Chevrolet Nova, which was basically an AE82 Corolla built at NUMMI.

NUMMI built cars continued well into the 2000s, with the Vibe being constructed at NUMMI. When General Motors went through bankruptcy in 2008-09, the culmination of that situation of GM having to cut back brands - Pontiac, among others - along with Toyota realizing that the NUMMI plant was much further from their mid-western suppliers (yet closer to Japan, being on the West coast) lead to Toyota closing the plant following GM's departure.

There's really a lot more to it than that, but that should give a real broad overview.

Re: the why, as in how a Toyota product could be built with GM insignia, many products often weren't in a favorable position-wise for GM's line up. My aforementioned Chevrolet Nova for example often sold for higher than Toyota Corollas did, meaning that it made more sense just to go down to your Toyota dealer. The situation in the 2000s probably wasn't looked at from a price point but more a dealer network and stock allocation situation. There could have been a Pontiac dealer with higher allocation to get more Vibes in, than a Toyota dealer in the same area, and vise versa.

You need to flush the system out as much as you possibly can before you put in the new radiator. It will probably need to get replaced again after this stuff clogs the new one too. This is a nightmare.

That is also the wrong coolant and you have to make sure you use the correct one in it this time. Hope it runs fine after you do all this, might need an engine.

Or it could be an alternator your alternator should have put out at least about thirteen point seven volts to fourteen point three somewhere in that neighborhood. You can go to your local park store and have them. Test your battery while it's in the vehicle and test the alternator while it's on the vehicle. The vehicle that you're driving, it's very simple to change the alternator on if you have any kind of mechanic ability at all, you could do a YouTube video and change it yourself and save yourself a whole lot of money on the park and the labor. Or if you hang out at the park store long enough, you'll see someone come in who works on vehicles. It doesn't have to be someone who works for a shop, but someone who's got some mechanical ability. Simply ask them, what would they charge you to change the alternator they could do it right there on the spot. And it would probably take twenty minutes or so if they had the tools with them. Or they'll make arrangements for you to bring it to them. And hang out while they do it. 
Also, you can ask some of the guys at the parts counter. A lot of them will do side work as well. Changing an alternator is not hard. It has 2 bolts holding it on.  That's what to do if you have any kind of sense. Hopefully, you will not turn out to be like a Reddit user. Yesterday that someone was putting in a new. Serpentine belt on their vehicle, and they took a pry bar and stuck it in the event of the alternator and broke the vents loose in it. And they fell inside the alternator and they also damaged it. The windings in the alternator with a pry bar, so they had no car when the guy left. I said I'll be back tomorrow. I'm waiting to see if he posts today stating if the person came back or not. 
But again, an alternator is not something hard to do on the vehicle that you have. I'm certain you could find somebody to change it probably for about 50 bucks and you can buy one for about half of what you will pay at a shop. 
O'reilly's carries Ultima, reman alternators, it'll run you about $350. I'm not sure if you have the 1.4 L. Engine or the 2.0 L, whether it's an 80 amp alternator or a 105 amp alternator. If you do not have to have it instantly, you can order from rock auto. And it fits the 1.4 L 88th, you can get it for about $150. If it's the 2.0 L it'll cost you about $225. This includes a core charge. $45. That is Bosch brand. I would also check my serpentine belt, and if it was showing any kind of significant wear, I would go ahead. And change it as well just as a safety precaution. Also, buy a good serpentine belt. Do not buy the cheap house brand name. They are thinner. It's skinnier, buy a good one, like Gates or Goodyear."

It's the same story for the frame. You'll need to cut a section out larger than the hole, that reaches decent uncorroded metal, then weld in a replacement section of steel.

* For about 2 weeks I noticed a “buzzing sound” when I would attempt to start the car. Sometimes it would not start on the initial attempt but then the second time I would turn the key more forcefully it would start. 
* Battery is brand new and I removed all corrosion that had built up on the terminals
* I went to Auto shop #1  a week ago and was told not to worry because it was an “electrical” issue related to how the key communicates to the starter. I was specifically told that the starter was not the issue and the car was safe to drive for a while.
* After the problem persisted for another week I went to Auto shop #2 (DC mobile auto repair in San Diego) for a second opinion and was told it was the ignition switch which was repaired for $444 ($280 labor + $164 parts). This price seems to be on the higher end.
* When I went to pick up the car I was told by the mechanic that my starter was failing and that I would likely have an issue “soon” but did not get specifics on how soon
* Sure enough a couple days later that car would not start
* The quote to repair the starter from DC mobile auto repair was $718 ($290 labor + $398 parts). This again seems high.

1m9df2y,❗️I offered Autel and Xhorse a working EEPROM fix for Smart Key ECUs — they ignored me.,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share a strange experience that may resonate with some of you working deep in diagnostics.

Over the past few months, I developed a working EEPROM-based recovery method for Smart Key ECUs specifically for Toyota Prius Gen 3 and Lexus CT200h, which become bricked after a full reset or failed key write.

These ECUs are considered “non-recoverable” once locked -even Autel and Xhorse tools can’t bring them back. The standard solution is full module replacement.

So I reached out to both companies - Autel and Xhorse - proposing a collaboration. I didn’t ask for money. I offered to contribute the solution in exchange for long-term tool access and cooperation. I even suggested working under NDA to protect both sides.

📭 No response. Total silence.

Not even a “thank you for your message.”

I’m not sharing the technical method here - not yet. But it made me realize how hard it is for independent technicians and inventors to bring something valuable into the diagnostic world without being ignored or dismissed.

I’m curious:
Has anyone here ever submitted a working method to a tool manufacturer and gotten the cold shoulder?

Do you think I should just share it openly - for the sake of helping techs like us?

Thanks for reading. Just had to vent a bit.

It was built in October of 2000 so it has the previous year cv axle with the ring groove for the snap ring being 1 5/16 below from the top of the female side of the cv axle.

I can speak pretty well on this subject as I left the automotive tech industry TO pursue the radiology field. 

*this is my personal opinion on the matter. I’m not here to tell you what to do, just telling you my thoughts on the matter. If you really want to do mechanics go right ahead. It can and is a promising industry for tens of thousands of people*

**also, I only worked at two different dealerships, YMMV and your location plays a huge factor. again, this is just my personal experience.**

Being a dealership tech was fun, it was interesting, and made a lot of good friends. It was interesting getting to learn different makes and models and being able to apply those skills in real life. 

But I will say this, healthcare burnout is bad (more so for nurses), but mechanic burnout is up there as well. Your hands will be greased stained, your back and body will ache after long shifts, and the hours just straight up fucking sucked. You never know how much you were bringing home, and a few slow weeks back to back at the shop could make a very significant impact. At one point (and don’t get me wrong, it’s very much shop dependent), I was working 6 days a week just to clear an 85 hour flat rate check. These were 9-10 hour shifts. **but,** on the flip side you can have checks where you only worked 90 hours and get paid for 120. But I personally just preferred consistency. The long shifts and low pay was also mostly in 2022 with the terrible financial crisis going on. Towards the end of ‘23 is smoothed back out a little. 

Something I do miss about the shop life is being able to bullshit and speak freely and… I guess you could say just be stupid with a bunch of different guys that would dish it right back to you. That’s certainly not the case for what you’re doing, and it’s a heavily female dominated industry. I’ve heard a lot of relationship drama whereas at the shop it was me and the boys acting like ignorant rednecks trying to fix a car (*points to a 6cyl Infiniti* “that right there got the VTEC engine souped up with an air filter must be making 500 horsepower to the wheels Jimmy!”). 

It was very fun to have the other techs playing their music, we’d all come in, get to work, help each other out if needed, and just have the satisfaction of fixing the problem (imaging is diagnostics only, and to me, isn’t quite as satisfying as getting the job done)

Ultimately, the appeal of only working 3 days a week, working in a clean environment, VERY LIMITED patient interaction, consistent checks, travel contracts ($3,000+ a week) made me decide that it was the right choice. I had family in the medical field growing up, always had it in the back of my mind because they always did well for themselves. honestly I wish I did it sooner. 

Working on cars is fun. It really is. But when you have to do it to keep a roof over your head, pay the bills, make sure my cats can eat, etc, the fun got sucked out quickly. 

That program you’re in is very competitive, so you must be fairly smart to have made it in that far. If you don’t want to do it, or have any doubts or just think “man, I can’t see myself doing this for the next 20-30 years” like I did with mechanics, then I think you have your answer.

I have an 08 335i modded and tuned, full bolt on Acura RSX S, and a hunk of shit F250 Crew Cab that keeps me entertained if I do get the hankering to work on a car. Lol. 

Good luck to you. You very clearly have a pretty big conflict with your current schooling to post here. Only you can answer your question though.

So, long story short, my partner had a crash in early June. The front end was really beat up. We took it to the auto shop about a week later (we didn't drive it almost at all during that time), and just got it back on Tuesday afternoon. The insurance paid for everything, and I think the quote was about $9K. It was really beat up, and they did a lot of work. Ultimately we paid nothing out of pocket.

My partner mentions the other day that the AC wasn't working great, and there was a weird sound sometimes, but it didn't seem to be a huge issue and when I drove it briefly yesterday, I didn't notice anything. I took it in yesterday morning to get the state safety inspection, and there were no issues, except the headlights on one side were starting to dim, so they mentioned I'd probably need to replace them soon. I also drove it to/from work and to/from picking up dinner. Didn't notice anything in particular.

Today there were problems. The AC wasn't as cold as it used to be, and would periodically basically stop blowing cold air (just regular temp). It would come in/out. Sometimes switching between circulated air, and air from outside would sort of snap it back into action, but it kept going in and out. We also noticed there's a distinct whine/vibration when we would get up to/around certain speeds, and particularly when it switched between gas and electric.

1. Are these my rear sway bar links?

I was driving around the other day in my 2007 Chrysler 300 and my front driver's side wheel began to slightly shake. I noticed the car was having difficulty picking up speed and I could hear a slight grinding sound when hitting the brakes.

I work for Honda, and (this is gonna sound stupid) different tread depth can throw DTC codes. They use  an indirect TPMS system reads off the wheel speed sensors. It calculates the rotation to determine tire PSI. If there is a big enough difference, vehicle senses it had a wrong size tire on. Small differences usually illuminate the TPMS light, sensing a low tire pressure. 

Again, idk if its the same for you but replacing all 4, nah. 

I do them in pairs to keep tire tread depths even on the axle. Use the good one as a full size spare."

1m9sxyb,my car’s burning coolant but i don’t think it’s the head gasket - what could it be?,"so i bought a holden astra AH (2008) a bit over a month ago and got it serviced pretty soon after. when getting it serviced, my mechanic told me that there was oil contamination in my coolant and they quoted me $1,800 to fix it (i needed my oil cooler and all coolant hoses replaced) but recommended that i just sell my car. 

my brother offered to help me with it and we decided that we would try to do it by myself. i got all genuine hoses and an aftermarket oil cooler with a three year warranty. 

we managed to replace everything and ended up having to get a coolant reservoir and one coolant hose that i couldn’t buy from the wreckers. 

when we put everything back and turned the car on the engine bay started smoking - we think this was because of the new gasket exhaust manifold that we installed but just adding in case relevant. 

we were flushing the coolant system with water initially and i held the revs at 2,000 and eventually the smoking in the engine bay went away but we noticed smoking from the exhaust. 

the water we were flushing the coolant system with had picked up some leftover coolant and had gone a shade of pink. 

according to my brother, the smoke coming from the exhaust was white and sweet-smelling. we were a bit worried but decided to drain the water and refill it again, and try to flush it again. we did this until the water remained clear and then the smoke was still coming out my exhaust but it didn’t smell sweet anymore - i think this was steam. 

we attributed this to rain, and the initial coolant burning might have been because we spilt some coolant into the exhaust pipe when removing the old oil cooler. 

then we drained and added a coolant flush solution in with more water and after revving it for a bit, the smoke began again but this time it was a neon blue. i know that oil also burns blue when burnt but my brother said that this wasn’t an “oil blue” cause of how bright it was. so i’m assuming it was the coolant flush burning in the exhaust. 

now, to why i don’t think this is the head gasket. we checked the oil and there’s absolutely no signs of contamination. my spark plugs are also dry. we haven’t noticed the coolant level dropping but it is a bit hard to tell when it’s been drained and refilled so many times. also, the smoke only begins once the engine has warmed up a bit, and at first there’s liquid dripping out my exhaust before the smoke starts. i’m not really an expert on cars but i assumed that if this contamination was happening in the combustion chamber then it wouldn’t need to warm up to be turned to smoke, and wouldn’t drip initially. 

so i really don’t know what could be wrong. my brother seems to think none of the work we did on the car could lead to this outcome but i guess i just want another opinion. 

our next course of action was going to be to run it with water for a bit longer and then check the spark plugs and oil again. we also have a camera on the end of this hose thing that we were gonna use to check inside the cylinders to look for contamination. 

if all that comes back fine my brother wants to run the car for a while to see if it could just be what we spilt into the exhaust and goes away on its own, but i’m concerned that if i run it more then i’m going to make the issue worse. 

i’d estimate that we’ve run the car for a total of 20-30 minutes and the smoke was worse initially, then seemed to be less. this also could be because it took us a while to notice the first time though.

Now, the front wheels shake while driving, the brakes feel stiff, and the calipers get very hot. It seems like both front calipers are seizing—neither wheel spins freely. Cracking the bleed nipple releases a small dribble of fluid and frees the wheel slightly, but it’s still stiff. I didn’t lubricate anything during the install.

So sometime last year I blew the head gasket— the leak from my radiator wasn’t too bad (as it took almost 2 months to fully drain) and I’m assuming slowly dripping into the engine as there were never any spills from the engine bay. Not sure if any of this matters but wanting to paint a quick picture of my previous issues.

I also previously replaced my water pump&amp; timing belt when I got the car last year (have only put about 5-6k miles on it so far)

About a week later, my check engine light came back on. I started noticing the car feeling a bit boggy too? The light turns on and off again, but this time much more frequent than prior to replacing the head gaskets. OBD codes spat out 25/26 at the same time as well.

Also, it stalled twice coming off the freeway. First time was a couple days ago, then again tonight. Both times coming to a complete stop upon taking an exit. Car is automatic. Started right back up after throwing it into park and then taking out / reinserting the key.

The mechanic who fixed it said to bring it by Thursday as that’s when he’s available next, but I’d like to be prepared and have a better idea of what could be causing these issues.

Never encountered these problems before and I drove the car a decent amount amount, even on the freeway (not proudly as I knew it needed work done lol)

My a/c completely stopped working the other night. It turned off mid-drive. No heat or cold air just zero airflow. I have been trying to do some YouTube research, and one of the guys said sometimes hitting it really hard will make it work again temporarily. It actually did work for about 2-3 hours, but the airflow was very weak (even on the highest setting) although the little air that does come out is ice cold. I could also hear it ticking under the passenger dash so thst raises my suspicious that it's the blower motor

Trying to figure out if it's the blower motor, regulator, or a fuse. I ordered a $20 multimeter to test the fuses and the connections to the blower motor. I looked up the blower motor and its a $60 replacement and the fix looks relatively easy. Regulator is about $30. The multimeter will be here tomorrow but I am wondering if I am going about this the right way. I have only ever done oil changes and have no mechanic experience.

1m9ivwd,Is it reasonable to buy a used car that turns very slightly while braking?,"I'm looking at a 2023 Subaru Ascent with 27k miles on it for $30k. No accidents. Looks good cosmetically. Engine bay is clean of any leaks (but hasn't been cleaned as evidenced by some pine tree bits). Dealer claims they inspected it thoroughly and showed me their inspection checklist.

But when I test drove, I could feel the wheel turn to the right ever so slightly while breaking on the freeway.

The dealership agreed to align the wheels to see if that fixes it. And I will test drive it again. But if I see the same issue after the alignment, should I ditch the car? Would the possible causes of this issue (ie, brake calipers or brake hoses) be worth taking on for a car that I like? Or am I creating an annoying and expensive chore? Thanks!

1m9dysp,Opinions on Fuel Tank Replacement? (2003 Toyota Corolla S),"hi all, I just had some bad news and **long story short**, i was told by a mechanic i need to replace my fuel tank which is the reason for my poor fuel economy. \~450-470 km on full tank instead of 540-550 km. i had some exhaust leaks and problems like an aftermarket cat and some vent control valve issue, and then a muffler. after these repairs he noticed that my fuel tank was rusty (bottom was fine), around the edges and seals mainly.

like imagine the fuel tank has a seam running along its edge and those edges are very rusted and frayed/flaky. he said this could be causing me to leak fuel and especially when i'm on an angle on a hill. he recommended i shouldn't fill past half. he quoted anywhere from $800-1000 for the job (parts and labour).

I already dropped a small fortune on the other repairs and not sure if i want to go through with this.

**Questions**

1. if it's along the edges and seals, is it possible to apply some sort of sealant material as a temporary fix that i can keep renewing? (i.e; apply and check every month).  
if so, what are your favourite ""sealants"" for automotive?

2. is it possible to replace the fuel tank (just the metal part, not the sensors and wiring) as a non-mechanical person? i've only done oil/brakes/rotors independently.  
i'd like to watch a bunch of videos and try to replicate it, my goal is to just replace the metal part along with new seals/gaskets whatever it would need, no electrical stuff needed. i have read that in many cases the entire rear may need to be dropped if it's obstructing the fuel tank however.

(for reference, a normal person cannot do a clutch replacement or an engine rebuild alone. lots of sophisticated tools and lifts would be needed).

  
3.  is $800-1000 a reasonable price? (this is in **Toronto, Canada**). this would include the belts/hangers along with the tank replacement.

Almost like the ABS/traction control was activated or the tires were slipping? The car is a manual transmission and I did notice that the rpms would spike when the car shuddered. Aside from that I haven’t experienced any issues getting it into gear or pulling away from red lights. If I go easy on the acceleration, I don’t have any issues. I can grab some new plugs/coil packs to see if it’s a spark issue but it makes me think it’s a clutch issue since I saw the rpms spike when the car begins to shake.

Hey everyone, I’d really appreciate some advice on this. 

I currently have a car on HP finance that I got through Carmoola at 18.8% APR. At the time, it was my only option since I had just moved to the UK from Australia and didn’t have much credit history. I drive a lot for work, so I needed something fairly new and reliable.

Fast forward over 3 years, I have now paid off nearly half of the total finance amount, and my contract says I can return the car and end the agreement early once I hit 50%, which I’ll reach by October 25.

Now I’m looking to lease a new car for work. My wife works from home but would use it on weekends with the kids, so something newer and more practical makes sense.

So should I end the current HP agreement first before applying for the lease? Or is it okay to apply for the lease while still having the HP agreement active, and then return the old car once the new one arrives?

I’m a bit unsure because I’ve heard it can take a while for settled accounts to show up on your credit file, and I don’t want my score to dip or be left without a car while waiting. My current Experian score is 977, and I’m considering a 6+48 lease deal looking at the Kia sportage. I earn about 2k after tax.

From a general advice PoV, make sure you explore all of the credit avenues available and carefully consider how long you want to keep the car. For your previous agreement, 18.8% is horrendous and HP is a financially bad way to keep a car for two years.

Also, get an updated 'finance settlement figure' from your HP. Walk into WeBuyAnyCar and ask how much they can give you. If you're lucky you may have some equity, WBAC will clear the finance, take the car, and give you the equity.

Leasing generally is not the most frugal way to get a car unless you 1) need a brand new car. And 2) have some kind of tax benefit from doing so.

Also, I only just read the last line. You earn 2k after tax. This doesn't sound like 'having two expensively financed cars at the same time' sort of money."

From my research i want a 1.6 MG TF, they are within my price range, as of right now insurance is £2200 with a black box which i do not mind although is a rip off, and it looks cool if you was to put a front lip and a trophy cup spoiler on it. Its a 2 seater meaning i can only have one passenger so i cant really be a show off, not that i can be with a blackbox.

I will be SORNing the car for a year due to me not being old enough to drive it yet (going to put it under a cover at side of house. I am still in school, just want the car so i definetly have a car that i like when the time comes). Thus It gives me time to help make sure the K series lump that is plauged with issues gets rectified if it needs perhaps, head studs and a MLS Head gasket, coolant alarm, dif bearings, it could set me up better for when i do a mechanics course in collage.

As far as i know, they can be solid motor's after SAIC bought out MG so maybe all i need to do is a basic service + some extras to make sure everythings good (Oil change, coolant alarm, air filter, Brake Latheing and new pads, etc) and i will have a little 115 HP convertable thats affordable for a 17 year old.

Do it, one of the best decisions I ever made. It cost me nothing to run, it was extremely relaible and a lot of fun.

The majority have already had the head gasket issue rectified (MLS isn't always the best idea, common misconception) but even if they haven't its very easy to do. Though later TFs don't really suffer anyway, a lot of changes were introduced in '04 and those were carried over into the N-Series.

I've since tried/owned several other assorted cars. And I maintain the F/TF is still the ultimate bargain fun machine, they're quicker than MX5s of a similar vintage and don't rust anywhere near as badly. And despite what a lot of people thing parts are still readily available, I never had an issue getting any parts for mine other than interior trim. 

The owners club is extremely helpful, so go and ask for some advise on there. They do have issues (no car is perfect) and most people on there will be willing to help solve any issues you may encounter.

I will also say the MX5 and MR2 are both great alternatives if you don't go for the MG. But I personally find the MG to be the best all-rounder, and as younger driver they're cheaper to insure. However if you do chose one of the others, you won't be disappointed!

1m9qhps,"Upgrade: electric or not, purely financial?","I would like to upgrade my old diesel Octavia and thought maybe it's time to switch to electric. Long range is essential, at least 250 miles in real life, the more the better. Also, as resistant to POTHOLES as it can get! Spent £700ish last year just on springs and shock absorbers! Another is rust resistance again as good as it gets, living on the coast sometimes we got seawater on the roads here which is a real killer thus quality long life coatings/metal is essential - otherwise the car can be budgeted tops 7-8years.

From purely financial pow, does it make sense to swap to a 3-4yo Tesla Model Y or something similar? The Skoda is getting long on the tooth, no motoric issues yet but the rust started to get in and diesel servicing costs are not exactly cheap.

I am completely noob in EV's, even in modern cars, the goal would be to minimize servicing costs while not loosing too much from what the octavia is offering (boot space, leg room, cheap and available parts if something is worn, rusted)

Edit: the EV would be indeed a higher entry price, but I expect saving on fuel and maintenance &amp; repair costs. I am currently researching if the approx £8k price premium on the EV compared to a similar age petrol or diesel Octavia breaks even in a reasonable timeframe.

Depends on your broader financial circumstances really. Also your annual mileage and whether or not you can charge at home.

But given your stated concerns — rust resistance, potholes, value retention — it doesn't strike me that EVs specifically would offer any significant advantage over anything else. EVs aren't demonstrably more rust-resistant or pothole-proof than any other car on the road.

Teslas generally aren't my thing but I do accept that the Model Y is probably Tesla's most well-resolved product right now and a genuinely good car in many, many ways.

But I also think you'd potentially get what you need with an efficient petrol or hybrid and a bit of forward planning on extra underbody protection. (That's what I do, I live in Edinburgh and we get a certain amount of salt here too.)

Potholes are a total pain but I've found that cars with fatter profile tyres and slightly softer sprung suspension soak them up better. It's not a recommend car by any stretch but the most pliant ride I've had around town recently was in a Citroen C5 Aircross. E Class Merc was good at soaking up poor surfaces too.

AlGunner (Score: 1): Insurance will be more but less servicing and repairs which work out in my favour for mine. Fuel costs work out probably 3p per mile driving like I dont care about cost (truth is at that cost I really dont care about economy). Maybe 2.5p in summer and 3.5p in winter when it uses more energy so costs go up and range down. This is in real world driving where my old diesel including mixed runs and local driving was about 15p per mile on a run up to 20p+ per mile when used in town or the run includes busier times. 

In reality on our roads it doesnt really matter how fast you drive, I get up to the speed limit whenever I can, you still rarely get over 50mph average. So for a 250 mile run its 5 hours plus maybe half an hour for a charge. For me that really doesnt make enough of a difference when the financials stack up. That 250 in my diesel would have been at least £37.5, but at home charging rates is £7.50. You still get 45p per mile on expenses for work if you use it for that. 

If you are using public charging its a lot more with Telsa being around 36-45p per kwh and other chargers being stupid money with a lot being 75p, so nearly 3 times peak rate at home. However, when you do need parts they are expensive for a Tesla. It is a premium car and comes with premium car repair costs, so other alternatives may be cheaper. 

All it all it mainly comes don to what your usage is and how often you will need to charge away at home."

1m9pho0,Skoda Octavia VRS IV,"Hey all, 

I wanted to share my experiences with the Skoda Octavia VRS IV after my 1st week. Bought the car with 60,000 miles 1 previous owner. 

The interior is fantastic quality, really feels like a genuine sporty car (owned a FK8 Type R (which I would have again anytime fantastic car), gt86, mx5 before). Very comfy and spacious.

The ride quality is a little floatier than I'd like, a touch too much body roll but I intend to replace the springs. But In general the car feels great to drive and not as heavy as I would have expected considering my previous experiences.

I chose the IV, controversial choice, but I should be able to charge at work when I return. The reason for me switching to an auto is I have had knee surgery from an old injury which means I may never operate a clutch again. And charging has been a fucking nightmare. Most public points dont have type 2 chargers, only the fast charge AC and DC. I do not have off road parking so charging at home is not really an option. Whether it's downloading a multitude of different apps and chargers not functioning or not taking payment. It's been in general a really poor experience. The idea was to charge my car at work for the 30 mile range just for my commute. Will see how that goes when I return.

Regardless of inability to charge, MPG has been fantastic. Sitting at an average of 45mpg on the long term with empty batteries (in hybrid mode for what that matters) Far higher than expected which is a slight benefit regardless of how hard it is to charge, with charge and in hybrid MPG sits about 80. 

Power, when using the battery is really nice, obviously nothing compares to the engagement the manual type R  offered, but I don't feel disappointed when I put my foot down.

Looks, its a great looking car IMO. as I said I am desperate to lower it 40mm on eibachs as it sits to high for my taste, and I'm not the biggest fan of the diamond cut wheels. Anyone have any thoughts on getting them powder coated bronze? I think it would contrast the the dark grey well. Or should I admit defeat and get some new alloys that are bronze out the shop.

TLDR; great interior and tech, feels sporty and engaging to drive (but doesn't compare to a real sports/perfomance car). Very economical, charging without a consistent charging point is very difficult.

- I would need to declare the car as modified for insurance which would affect the rate (I assume?)

- I have zero experience with car fixes, so a leak is on my radar in the sense of 'How will I deal with this'. But at least good they're communicating it up front and not hiding it

&gt; • 84251 miles, 31/08/2024 (2x front suspension arms, 4 Goodyear Eagle F1 tyres, laser alignment)

&gt; In the last 6 months it has also had a new thermostat and housing and fuel pressure sensor.

&gt; Cosmetically it is in very good condition, it polishes up nicely and is original. I did an HPI test when I bought it and it was all clear. There is a small scuff to the N/S rear bumper which I always said I’d sort and never did, a light dent in the N/S rear passenger door – easily removable by a dent man, and the front N/S bumper is slightly hazy – I suspect you could machine polish it up.

&gt; The headlights are clear, they were polished recently along with new xenon bulbs.

&gt; The interior is very good, I treat it every year with leather cream, and the seats show none of the drying and cracking you see on some of these cars. The front A-pillars have started to peel slightly, find one of these cars where they haven’t…

&gt; At 76k miles it had nearly £3k of work undertaken at Shemtek Automotive in Nottinghamshire, one of the best names in the business for Volvo 5 cylinder engines. Along with the work detailed above, it had a bigger DO88 intercooler and pipework fitted (these breathe much better), and a light remap to make the most of the extra flow. It’s estimated to be around 300bhp now, and it is the most linear, smooth power delivery of any engine I’ve ever driven, along with a wonderful 5 cylinder soundtrack.

&gt; I was keen not to do any other modifications to it, and it has nothing obvious or ‘chavvy’, but suffice to say it is now a quick car.

&gt; There are a couple of other niggles – there seems to be a slight leak coming into the corner of &gt; the passenger footwell – only in heavy rain, I suspect it is the rubber seals on the edge of the windscreen – common and DIY fixable – I haven’t done it as it’s mainly lived in the garage the last 2 years.

&gt; It also needs a new alarm siren unit, as it has been going off intermittently. I have a new one from Volvo (£200) and intend on sorting this before I sell, but if anyone is keen and wants to take it as is I will just throw this in and factor into the price. The siren currently doesn’t sound so it wouldn’t wake the neighbours.

&gt; MOT til 20th December. I don’t think it will need anything to pass again.

I'm in the market to buy a 2nd hand Audi A4 2021 and I've found one and after I did a HPI check on it, it seems like there is a mileage discrepancy on this car as you can see from the images.

The car is currently being advertised as having around 30k miles and the MOT states that it has 29k. However, why does the National Mileage Register say it's got 44k miles on? The car is also from Birmingham and it's being sold by the CarSupermarket, so I don't think it's sketchy? Should I walk away from this car? I will be taking a test drive on it next week.

Any help would be grateful as I'm not sure what the National Mileage Register is and is it an admin error?

1m9j7pc,30k miles vs 60k miles - £4.5k difference worth it?,"**Looking at a Kia Stinger GTS 3.3 — need advice on value between two options**

Hey guys, I'm in the market for a Kia Stinger GTS 3.3 and have two options I'm considering. Would appreciate some input on whether the price difference is justified.

**Option 1:**

* 2020 (20 reg)
* 33k miles
* £24,500 from a dealer (no room to haggle)
* Warranty until March 2027
* Full service history
* I will need to replace the tyres and brake pads when purchased + get a new MOT done

**Option 2:**

* 2019 (69 reg)
* 61k miles
* £20,000
* Includes a Maxton body kit (worth \~£650), upgraded tyres + brake pads
* 1 previous owner — a car enthusiast who's looked after it well
* Warranty until September 2026
* Full service history

So the main difference is £4,500 for 30k fewer miles, an extra 6 months of warranty, and a newer reg — but the 2019 comes with some decent extras and has been enthusiast-owned.

**Is that £4,500 premium worth it, or is it a bit steep for just lower mileage and a newer plate? Considering I will be also purchasing the maxton body kit on top.**

Let me know what you think.

as a young woman i’ve noticed the most hostile group on the roads are middle aged white men. on multiple occasions ive been overtaken by sum cunt tail gating me for ages when already going just above the speed limit (no more than up to 10% above), break checked and then having that same guy shouting at me from his car window or coming up to mine. i’ve had men stop behind me in the middle of the road then chase me on foot. had sexually violent gestures made at me when stopped at traffic lights bc i was going a few mph faster than them. 

barely anyone indicates, on average of abt 3x a week i have to slam on my breaks to a complete stop from ppl pulling out metres away from my car after making direct eye contact, no one gives u space to join onto dual carriage / motor ways meaning u either have to slow all the way down to 30mph to get behind (and then get flashed endlessly by the car behind) or drop a gear to get infront (and then get tail gated to fuk), or if ur super unlucky u end up stuck waiting for a big enuff gap to step on it. let’s not forget middle / right lane hoggers going under the speed limit who refuse to move over even if u flash them repeatedly or when u overtake sum1 going half the speed to then not let u pass as they speed up with u. 

luckily enuff i’ve always had great spacial awareness and fast reaction times due to the type of autism i have as well as great gear control so with that ontop of my experience, i am quite a  skilled driver (i only have a 1.2 golf, it’s not super old but a good decade, and isn’t that powerful but i can still make it work) if it weren’t for that, i wld have been in multiple serious crashes already or maybe even dead from the count of other drivers. 

i cld write an entire book abt all the incidents ive had with middle aged drivers in general bc every time i get back on the road when i return home from uni, it gets worse. honestly i feel like they shld start making u take an aggression, IQ and spacial awareness test to drive bc wtf.

all of that is not to say that ppl can’t make mistakes,it’s part of being human, i have definitely done my fair share in which i always use my warning lights to say sorry and have since learnt from

but still why do sm of these drivers get away w it and continue to make being on the road or even a pedestrian increasingly unsafe. just existing as a woman in the uk is unsafe let alone adding a couple tonne metal cube on wheels operated by sum1 that uses their left big toe as a brain

Usually they produce a brighter light close up, as they do tend to be that - brighter, but the engineering of the reflector and the full beam is to 'throw' the light that distance needed, and they are duller at distance than halogens.

Retrofit HID in full beam is also bad as they take time to warm up and the switching on and off of HID bulbs is what kills them.

Best bet is a good pair of Philips/Osram/big name halogen bulbs, something with 150%+ output.

Just sold my GLC 220d and looking at a 5 series, but I'm unfamiliar with them and was looking for some advice please.

I've seen two potential cars via the approved used site:

1. G31 520d M Sport w/ 64,000 miles - £18k
2. G30 530d SE X-Drive w/ 36,000 miles - £21k

My main question is mainly around whether there will be any major differences in the SE Trim besides the cosmetic features? I know there's a lot more Chrome for example which isn't to everyone's tastes - but apart from that, and the different steering wheel, I don't see much else. Is SE likely to affect the drive in any way, particularly with the X Drive?

Also, I do prefer the look of the Touring over the Saloon, and having watched some reviews of the 530d, it seems to have great reviews and looks like a beast in terms of performance and power - but I question whether I'd really be able to make much use of it in the real world? Does the extra power really merit the hype and is it worth going for, despite the SE Trim level it has?

I do around 16,000 miles per year - most of which are motorway miles.

It looks lovely, has a peach of an engine which will serve you well considering the mileage you do and with less mileage at the outset, will still be acceptable in a few years time. Neither have the Harmon K set up ( that would be a deal breaker for me as I love my music), but as an all rounder, the SE every time.
When it comes to resale, you may have more of a chance with the 530, a little more desirable imho. The only other thing to think of is the X drive. Unsure about this series, but when we had our X5 and X3s, there were some scare stories about tyre wear and replacing 4 at a time.

2 months ago bought a used MG4 on PCP. When I picked it up, it looked immaculate however there was a bit of loose trim, which at the time I had heard about being an issue with early MG4s. I sadly did not reject it at that point. There was no mention on the sales page of any previous damage.

Over the course of the next few weeks I discovered a few issues on the passenger side of the car, which had broke, due to what looked like inexpertly carried out repairs. The aforementioned trim, another trim which had come loose, a missing screw holding a piece of bodywork off another which has lead to paint damage. At this point I emailed the dealership seeking for them to pay for repairs.

The agreed to fix these issues, but I was suspicious that everything was in a certain area so I finally took it to an independent body shop, who took photo evidence and emailed me a write with 9 areas of damage, bent chassis rails, bent door frames to match and encouraged me to reject the car. They didn't give a quote because they do no know the extend of the damage without stripping that side of the car down. None of this was easily visible at time of purchase to me untrained eye at least. 

With this in mind I believe I have a recourse via the Consumer Rights Act 2015, in which I have a right to one chance to repair, a replacement or a refund (minus the miles I've driven etc). However since the damage that has been uncovered devalues the car, I suspect I can reach out to the finance company also?
