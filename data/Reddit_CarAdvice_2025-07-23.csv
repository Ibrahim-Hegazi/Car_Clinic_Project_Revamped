I decided to take advantage of the buy three get one free and got my wheel alignment and all. They did recommend to me that my front struts are wearing out and to keep everything running smoothly. I should replace them in the future. I haven’t replaced the front struts and I know they should be replaced every 50,000to 100,000 miles. I asked the gentleman what would he quote me for the two front struts including labor and he told me $1600.. I really feel like this is an absurd amount. This post isn’t about my car shoes or anything like that mostly about what led to a quote of $1600 for labor and struts.  Is this normal? I need some advice?

1m6p8s4,Honda Dealership service - AC condenser issue,"Hey everyone, looking for some advice on a frustrating experience I just had at a Honda dealership regarding my 2019 Honda Civic’s air conditioning.

A while ago, I took my car in and they diagnosed it with a leaking AC condenser. They didn’t have the part in stock, so I was told to wait. While waiting, I recharged the AC myself using a can of R-1234yf—the correct refrigerant for my vehicle.

Fast forward to July 14, I brought the car back in and they suddenly tell me my AC system is “contaminated,” claiming it contains **84% hydrocarbon** and only **14.8% correct refrigerant**. I was confused since I only used the right product and followed instructions carefully.

When I asked how this contamination could’ve happened, they gave me zero clear answers. Instead, they insisted I pay **two hours of labour** for diagnostics. I pushed back, asking for an explanation or even a theory, but got nothing useful in return.

I ended up writing a formal email to them asking for:

* A proper explanation of how they got those results
* How this could happen despite using the right refrigerant

**So Reddit:**

* Has anyone else experienced something similar?
* Is it possible the shop made a mistake with the diagnostic?
* Was I right to push back and ask for my money back?
* What should I do next?

Not even two months later, the same problem happened again with the same code. I took it back to Firestone and they said it must have been a faulty MAF sensor. The day I got my car back, the issue happened again so I took it back the same day. 

They said it was the rear 02 sensor in bank 1 so they replaced it. They did not tell me that there was a possible oil leak. (Keep that in mind) They told me they could not guarantee that the issue was fixed. So I took it to Subaru. 

Subaru found multiple issues including 2 oil leaks by the oil cooler and a wiring harness soaked in oil which would have caused the 02 sensor to fail. All of the issues cost over $3000. (Few small repairs added in)

I told Firestone what was found and they said they would only credit the diagnostic fee I paid ($130) and the second diagnostic fee at Subaru ($180).

I have been the only owner of the vehicle, and have only ever let 5 other people drive my car (I am extremely anal about my vehicle as my father is the same way). I’ve always had ALL routine maintenance done when it’s needed to be done, and taken it into a GM Service department to have everything done.

At 41,000 miles my entire transmission blew in the vehicle. They have no idea why, and it was in the GM service shop for two months because of this. It was replaced and not rebuilt. It NEVER threw any codes at all, and I actually had to take it in about 5 times before they would listen to me because I could tell the transmission was gone (I’ve had one other vehicle that turned out to be a lemon with a blown tranny). At 48,000 miles I had a CV axel blow and replaced this (I think it was due to the horrible roads where I live). At 50,000 miles I had a “Service All Wheel System” message pop up, took it in and they told me “it’s not throwing any codes so idk”. 

Ever since the transmission issues started it has not been the same car. I have barely any acceleration, my RPM’s will shoot up about 1 mile after I turn the car on after it’s been off for more than a few hours, it will just randomly do this. Whenever I go above 60mph my RPMs will not drop below 2,000. It is shifting incredibly hard; and I believe it was around 47,000 miles while I was merging onto the highway I lost all acceleration power and my engine light started flashing. I took it into the shop and they said “it not throwing any codes”. When I turn right the vehicle will vibrate sometimes; I had new wheels put on in December; have had an alignment and rotation. It makes a weird puttering noise from my exhaust when the vehicle is on as well. My MPG has been lowering as well.

I’ve taken it into the shop probably 10 times this year alone. I am defeated and have no idea what is happening with this car.

My wife drives a 2008 ford taurus x. We have had it for 5 years and it has been good to us. Recently, I put in new front pads and rotors. I also found a leaky calliper, so I swapped that out. The brakes are feeling better, but after being in there, I found a few other things to replace. Here is what it needs to really be tuned up:

- wheel alignment
- new cv axles (still got some life but they are on the way out)
- new rear brakes 
- new passenger side mirror

Other than the alignment, I feel like I could do the work. What makes me hesitant is, the transmission is starting to get slow. I’m not sure if I should put all the work into it just to have the transmission go. If this were a cooler car with some style, and one that we really cared about, I’d do all the work and put a new transmission in it if it ever goes. But it is not a cool car haha.

1m6lphd,Modern Day Mechanic Outlook on pro-active replacement,"I recently picked up a 20 year old Acura with over 200k miles.  I have little service history on the car and am pretty sure all the major engine bay components are OEM.  For the last month, I've reached out to a couple of my go-to car mechanics after a decade long hiatus of owning a car to get quotes on overhauling the more significant items; water pump, alternator, starter, etc.  

Some of them asked if anything was wrong with the parts in context and I said no.  They shared it would probably be best to just keep driving it and to only replace it when things start to fail or go on the mend.  As someone who got their license in the 20th century, I was always taught it's much more practical and sane to have components changed out to prevent yourself from being stranded on the side of the road somewhere and at the mercy of being somewhere outside the radius of your hometown and with a significant snuff to whatever you had planned for the day(s).  Especially at 100/200k mile intervals, a $1500-2k overhaul is relatively inexpensive given how much value it provides.

When I mentioned this this to my mechanics, they had no adequate response.  I also added context of being on a road trip, say 3-400 miles away and an alternator fails. Then what?  Just a short blank stare and then a ""oh, well I would just find somewhere to get it fixed at that point"".   Perhaps maybe a skewed perspective since mechanics could probably change anything out in a parking lot but just curious what the consensus is here?

Note:  I've seen some other forums mention similar perspectives, I'm also not trying to induce any car manufacturer factors here either nor equating that one has to be on top of the recommended service manual down to every last line item.

Most cans have sealant in them, and sometimes also lubricant. Its probably been building up in your AC and is starting(finishing?) blocking passageways.


Even if its only freon being added, there's definitely a max. Eventually the entire system will be liquid refrigerant and the compressor will hydrolock. TBH, that's really unlikely because the high pressure switch will almost definitely keep the compressor from running."

At the repair shop where they did the oil change i also asked them to look into this oil consumption issue (also had a small stalling problem which they fixed) and they did an engine flush, found no oil leaks but there were a few bad/broken hoses which they changed (cant remember exactly what hoses they were one was for the breather and i assume these were mostly related to the stalling issue) and they told me nothing obvious seems to be the problem and if it keeps eating oil it means there is a bigger problem in the engine and the repairs would be pretty expensive.

1m6b7y1,Check Engine light keeps coming back,"Hi everyone,

I bought a Toyota Avensis 1.8 T22 (138,000 km) two weeks ago. Just two hours after I picked it up, the check engine light came on – although the car seemed to drive fine.

The next day, I took it back to the dealer. During his test drive, the car broke down on the highway and wouldn’t start again. The issue turned out to be a blown fuse for the fuel pump – so the pump wasn’t getting power.

The workshop replaced the fuel pump and the fuse, and afterwards the check engine light turned off (even without a scan tool). But when I picked up the car, the engine light came back on shortly after.

Now the car has stalled twice, both times when I was in 1st or reverse gear with the clutch fully pressed, not moving.

What could be the issue?
The car had been sitting unused for about a year before I bought it.
I do have 12 months dealer warranty, so repairs are covered – but neither the dealer nor the workshop knows what the actual cause is.
I bought a scan tool and its on the way, so i can possibly know what it is.

1m6a3ys,CX5 wheel swap TPMS issue,"I’ve just ordered a new Mazda CX-5 Touring, which comes standard with 19” wheels. But I actually prefer the 17” wheels from the lower-spec Maxx Sport — chunkier rubber, more comfortable ride, cheaper tyre replacement, and better durability on rough roads.

Initially, the dealer agreed to do a no-cost swap to the 17s (since they could then use my 19s as an “upgrade” on one of their Maxx Sport demo models). Win-win.

Now they’ve changed their tune, saying it’s not possible due to the tyre pressure monitoring system (TPMS). Apparently the TPMS is “trim-specific” and they claim it will trigger warnings or malfunction if wheels from a different spec are fitted — even though both trims use very similar recommended pressures.

That doesn’t quite add up to me — surely if you replaced a wheel due to damage, it wouldn’t brick the system?

Does anyone have any actual knowledge on how Mazda TPMS works with trim-level swaps? Is there a workaround, like resetting or reprogramming the system?

Would love to hear from anyone who’s done something similar, or has advice on how to approach the dealer again.

During my journey I’ve noticed a faint but noticeable tremor, which doesn’t translate to steering wheel like misalignment (even at 100 mph the steering wheel is steady w/o any stutter), but rather can be felt throughout the car. I drove these 1500 miles w/o shoes, and I felt it more in the floorboard than anything. I think it got worse for the last couple hundred miles and it’s only noticeable from like 70 mph upwards. It also gets more pronounced towards 100 mph. It is still not egregious but it’s there. I can’t seem to remember being there, and I have got no roof bars or anything.

Now, since my tyre wear was only on nearside front and rear (left), I asked the garage to take care of that, and they did change both, but neither on the offside (right).

This is my 2013 Dodge Dart Limited with the 1.4L Turbocharged engine. The car currently has 102K miles on it whereas in the video it had around 97K miles. The problem is that the engine starts to stutter and lose power when I give it too much throttle as seen in the video. The stutter is even more pronounced at low RPMs when the boost kicks in. If I let it stutter for too long the car lets off a smell that I can't describe, but the smell is most definitely related to the stutter. I took my car to the mechanic for this issue earlier in the year but I never found out what the problem actually was. I wasn't able to go pick up the car myself so I had somebody else pick up the keys so I could get the car later. Because of this, I wasn't able to speak to the mechanic directly. The person who picked up the keys told me that the mechanic said that he ""reconnected something"" that was causing the problem for free. Whatever he reconnected did actually fix the stutter so I didn't think much of it. But the problem came back a week later and by that time the mechanic didn't remember what he had done because of how many cars he works on every week. And since he fixed it for free it did not show up on the receipt. 

The problem is still occurring but has not gotten any worse. Keep in mind that the car has over 100K miles and I have yet to replace the spark plugs, coils, or timing belt. There are other problems that could be related, such as the rough idle when the air is turned on. Does anybody have any idea what could be causing this problem. I'm hoping it is something simple like spark plugs or coils because I do also have to replace the timing belt and that is going to be expensive by itself.",1,1753163589.0,6,MechanicAdvice,1753304285,2025-07-22 05:53:09,2025-07-23 20:58:05,"thymewaster25 (Score: 1): Is the checkmengine light on?

For context: Did accidentally try to start the car with cylinders 2 &amp; 4s spark plug wires switched. Also did not use torque wrench for spark plugs. Fixed that and then the car idled rough, but did not stutter at all upon idle acceleration. We think it may have idled rough because before we started the job we noticed the passenger PCV hose was disconnected from the back. We think it may have been running rough because the ECU was accustomed to not having it. After this happened was when we broke the nut for the battery and attempted to replace it, now the car starts but dies immediately.

I've been fighting this issue with my truck for over 4 years it seems. Not sure what the first issue was but there's always been an issue. Issue is something with the hydroboost part of the brake system. The best way to describe it is at low RPMs, the hydro boost doesn't build power to give me power brakes. The hydraulic portion of the brakes work fine and I even recently changed to the rear disc brakes and it didn't make much of a difference. So if I drive slow, I don't have good power brakes but if I keep the RPMs up, I have good pressure/power behind the brake pedal. I have done everything that you could think of including replacing every component at least twice. Recently I put an aftermarket upgraded power steering pump and a brand new (not reman) hydroboost unit with no difference. It's hard to find someone to take it to for them to figure out what the issue is I'm but I drive the truck everyday and I can almost predict when I'm going to have good brakes and when I'm not.

We had an oil change about 3 weeks ago and ironically the same light came on right after the oil change, but when we took it to our mechanic he said his code reader didn’t pop anything up and that is was likely something with the oil change that triggered it. We had it turned off and now, three weeks later as we were driving, it came back on (and also triggered our check engine light.)

Anyone familiar with what might be going on, and if it is the oil control valve, is this something we need to get done before driving back 3 hours? We are out of state.

What probably happened was the plugs were not replaced the first time and after so many heat cycles one of the plugs came loose and started to rattle around in the threads of that cylinder - repair #1. This can weaken the threads in the cylinder head. 

Repair 2, weakened threads in the cylinder head, they torque the spark plug down the threads pull off the cylinder head and stay on the spark plug. It looks like a helicoil to an inexperienced techs but it's actually just the thread in the aluminum cylinder head have sheared off of the head.

There's probably photos on Google of the same style failure in Honda drain plugs. Search for something like ""Honda drain plug pulled threads"". 

So really the failure was not replacing the plugs before they came loose and caused repair #1."

The water pump may have already been replaced.  There's some subtle hints you can look for in the engine compartment.  Look for tool marks on the the passenger side engine mount, crank bolt, valve cover bolts and timing cover bolts.  Check the edge of the timing cover for blobs of RTV.  The factory RTV is very precisely applied and has no blobs, but it's almost impossible to duplicate in a shop.  See if the belt tensioner is cleaner than the surrounding parts.

And hopefully you used Motorcraft Yellow coolant with the drain and fill.  Ford claims it has better lubrication properties than the orange coolant did."

1m5zk5s,Attempting to replace multiple AC parts on my own,"I got a couple of quotes on the possible need to replace multiple AC parts on a 2007 Saturn Ion-2 2.2. I was thinking of attempting this job myself. I've done quite a few things myself and feel this wouldn't be so hard. I already purchased a compressor and will get a new condenser (drier/receiver affixed), expansion valve, and may a new suction &amp; discharge line assembly, if necessary.

I will have a professional at a shop, maybe diagnose it and discharge the system, if needed. He quoted me $1600 parts and labor. I've replaced the starter on this car and have also had to remove the serpentine belt a few times to do other things so I know what I'm dealing with as far as the compressor. Also, I replaced the radiator, which is literally right up against the condenser. The expansion valve might be challenging, but if the few videos I watched are somewhat accurate, I think I can do it. Don't think I have to remove the whole dashboard.

Any advice anyone here can give me or anyone with experience can share. Hopefully, someone here has taken on this same task on this same year make and model. Anything you wouldn't replace due to it not being necessary. All the parts I've found are pretty inexpensive, so far. Is it necessary to replace multiple parts when replacing the compressor? Or could evacuating/flushing play the same roll?

Would really appreciate some pointers. So desperately wanna knock this out myself. Am I in over my head?

When doing the work, do the drier last. Ideally the drier plugs should be removed and the drier put back in within 15 minutes. It's whole job is to suck water out of the refrigerant and it'll instead get it from the air if given a chance. For some reason its challenging/impossible(or maybe just slow) to properly re-dry them once they've absorbed moisture from the air.

The new condenser most likely comes with the receiver dryer, but if it doesn't, make sure you replace that as well

As far as replacing multiple parts, that tends to be the method for newer vehicles. The logic being that they will be unable to flush the condenser and it will contain contaminated parts if the compressor has failed at all."

Test for combustion gasses in the coolant also passed and spark plugs were pulled with no visible coolant or steam cleaning of the piston head. I pressure tested the radiator itself with the cap on and could hear air leaking out of the port for the overflow reservoir and absolutely no pressure builds, (normally the pressure tester uses the neck for the cap so it isn't able to be tested) My thought is that the cap isn't sealing against the inner part of the radiator that usually passes coolant in and out of the overflow reservoir as it looks visibly warped, causing coolant to be pushed out and into the overflow and preventing the system from pressurizing.

* $1.3k brake pad and rotor replacement x4
* $400 transmission flush

At the same time, this mechanic is someone who I’ve done business with in the past and has been helpful, so I don’t necessarily have a reason to believe he’s trying to rip me off. I called to ask him details and he mentioned that the car could still pass inspection but that the brakes were getting worn, and that, if I didn’t replace the struts, I may need new tyres next year.

The truck is 25 years old. Pushing 300k. Im almost positive it's the original fuel pump. I have a new pump being delivered today. After installation, I'm going to recheck the pressure. If it increases, then I will know it was a poor functioning pump.

Since the fuel pressure is checked before it enters the injectors, having a clogged injector screen(s) doesn't seem like it would be the issue.

My thoughts were that a kinked line would possibly cause more of a pressure drop than 10 psi. Cleaning the fuel lines, is this a manual job, or would something like Red Line work to remove any deposits? Assuming it's not some sort of debris blocking the line."

Pump tested fine run off a wire to battery, but doesn’t prime when connected and in the tank so I don’t think it’s defective unless it’s the sensor itself, wiring also looks ok

0 compression in all (4) cylinders. Compression tester shows correct numbers on other engines so I'm confident the tester works.

I've confirmed it has spark and fuel. Timing was off and the chain was loose so I bought a timing chain kit and replaced everything so now timing is also correct but it's still crank no start with 0 compression.

I poured some oil into a cylinder and tester still showed 0 so rings are probabaly good.

1m5vc2e,2011 Toyota Camry LE 2.5-liter: Are these real issues/ issues worth fixing now?,"Hey everyone, thank you for taking the time to read my post. I am not at all a car person..... and this subreddit was a huge help over the past few weeks in choosing a used car to buy. So thank you!   
 I recently bought a Toyota Camry on Marketplace. Took it in for a pre purchase inspection. Long story short is I was not happy at all with the place I took it to: bad communication, kept wanting more money to diagnose, non-direct answers. I still bought the car because even knowing it might need some work done (as any car does and nothing flagged was engine or transmission related) I assume/hope it should have plenty of life left at 81,000 miles. I took it to a different local shop for them to further diagnose/fix the main issue (steering wheel shakes when breaking at high speed). So far, it has been a much better experience. A likely cause is warped rotors (never mentioned at all at the first place but tracks with online research a lot) and the wheel bearing issue flagged at the first place for $950 good chance isn't the actual problem according to the new shop. Anyways, there were two specific things with the car flagged (one at each place) that I would love some advice on.   
The first issue (flagged at first shop) relates to the exhaust system, /parts (see attached image).  Do you see any major concerns, and do you think I should fix this asap? Somewhat soon? Or totally fine it's just normal old?   
The second relates to the Front Suspension System (flagged at second shop) \*\*\*recommend replace front control arms due to torn bushings\*\*.  They don't seem to think this is an imminent problem for safety or have to be fixed right now..... but it was flagged, so curious to get others takes and advice.

I prided myself on always being reliable since I worked at various jobs my whole life, until recently, full time from 1986-2021, excluding attending schools. 

In 2025, I used my small inheritance to pay cash for a 2025 Subaru, thinking it would eliminate a car payment and be reliable for a while. 

Five days after I moved to a more rural/suburban area, using a veteran home loan, my new car got, or was revealed to have, multiple defects.

I consulted lemon lawyers because I paid cash for the car. 

I found several who said I have a lemon law case, and now, I have to wait up to a year for resolution.

It means I am unable to supplement my fixed disability income to buy food.

I was doing DoorDash and Uber.

Now that the car is a lemon, it should not be passed on to another consumer.

I did decide to try to drive the lemon car (out of California) to a cheaper place to live where I would not need a car. 

Or, to the east coast to ultimately fly out of the US, to a cheaper country. 

The issue would be that I have to get the car across the US to the east coast where I am from. 

I get mixed opinions on whether it is safe to drive the car. 

If it gets to Virginia, a mechanic there told me on the phone that it might not pass the required annual safety inspection.

I am basically ruined, since I counted on this car to get to earn money to buy food.

Does anyone have any stories on what you did in the time you were waiting for the lemon law claim to adjudicate or settle?

I feel like it is a bunch of catch-22’s. 

I cannot stay here without a car, since food and utilities are more expensive. I am in a wildfire zone and do not want to wheel my pets out in a wagon on foot if I have to evacuate.

2. keeping engines stock from the factory is the worst way to make more power, you could just turbo the engine thats already in the car and end up making more power than this swap would get you with no extra tuning or modification. thats why turbo kits are also much more popular than swaps, they are just way easier and usually cheaper.

AKADriver (Score: 2): Yes, in fact this is the only sort of engine swap that *is* possible if you aren't capable of metal fabrication.

The most likely way to make it work would be to buy a complete rear end crashed Megane RS as the donor, so you can take everything including all the electronic components. To be extra sure try to get cars within the same production year as sometimes manufacturers will make lots of little hidden changes across what looks like a minor facelift. I've seen engine swaps where everything bolted in and looked like it was going to plug in but then differences between like a 2012 engine wiring harness and a 2010 chassis wiring harness took more time to sort out than the whole rest of the swap.

About the only unknown is how much merging of the body wiring harnesses would be necessary, how modular they made it. Some cars are very modular and you can just plug stuff together. Then some cars like 1990s Subarus there's no separate engine and chassis harness so something like putting a WRX engine in a US GC Impreza coupe (since we didn't get the WRX before 2002) requires splicing and repinning dozens of wires, even though the mechanical stuff just plonks right in."

The mechanic said that one of my calipers were seized and to replace it, along with new pads and rotors for the front brakes.

That fixed the main issue, the brakes stopped make the original noise. But now they make a new noise when I first release the brakes and in the final moment when I come to a complete stop. It's a sort of loud clunk sound. If I release the brakes slowly it often makes a loud groan now too. Both these sounds are totally new since the brake work.

The brakes are silent when I'm moving/slowing down, the noise is only at the final moment when I come to a complete stop, or when I first release them from a complete stop.

Brought my car back to the mechanic and they're claiming it's normal and due to a coating on the new rotors 😮‍💨 I've had new pads and rotors installed before and never had a noise like this.

I've been driving it for a few months now and the noise is still bothering me.

A couple questions I have are:

A) is it reasonable to ask for them to fix the noise? I paid $1200 CAD + tax for my brakes and I expected them to be silent.

B) what's the best way to describe the issue to the mechanic? When they say it's normal, I feel like maybe they're gas lighting me?

C) is it due to using cheaper parts?

D) for future work, how can I avoid this happening again? Do I need to ask for better quality parts? How do I know what part is good enough? Should I just get it serviced at the dealership instead?

Been slowly burning through coolant for a while now, thought it was a faulty reservoir cap that I replaced a few weeks ago that was venting extra coolant out, but kept having the issue after I fixed. 

When driving home, car started overheating, so I turned the heater on full blast to vent it until I got home. Immediately started getting white smoke/steam out of the vents in the car, so I shut it off and pulled over. When I got out, popped the hood and saw no smoke or strange smells, but did notice a large amout of fluid (looks like coolant) leaking out, right near the front, passenger side wheel.

1m5wbvo,"False ""bad charging system"" test result at AutoZone (2017 Honda Accord)","TLDR: AutoZone's alternator tester will give a false result of ""Bad Charging System"" (aka bad alternator) when idling, because Honda (and maybe other car makes) alternators only run as needed (as I understand it) when there's extra electrical load like headlights or air conditioning. 

Don't replace a perfectly good alternator based on that test - go see your mechanic or test it yourself (if you know how - I don't).

\-----

Act 1:

Got into my car (2017 Honda Accord LX) this morning and tried to start the car.

""Krrrk"" sounds from the starter, but no joy. Headlights turned on OK, though.

""Crap, it's the battery"", I said to myself.

Jump started from my wife's car and drove to AutoZone.

The sales guy brought out his tester and indeed found the battery was dying (I don't have the exact result with me) - not unexpected, this was a four-year-old battery and I'm in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, where the summer heat kills batteries after not too many years.

I replaced the battery, and the guy installed it. No problems starting up now.

I said, ""Man, I was hoping it wasn't the alternator.""

He says, ""You want me to test it?"" I said, ""Sure"".

He brings out a different tester (at least I think it was different from the first one), connects it, and has me start up the car. While idling, the tester reports ""Good Battery"" (of course) and ""Good Starting System"" but ""Bad Charging System (Voltage Regulation: Fail; Diodes: Pass.)""

The weird thing is that there are NO warning lights lit up on the dashboard, especially the ""Charging System Warning"" light. Nada, zero, nil. 

He says, ""Do you want me to price out an alternator?"" I said, ""Nah, I wouldn't know to install it anyway, I'm going to call my independent Honda mechanic.""

\-----

Act 2:

I call the independent Honda/Acura shop my family's used for years (The Hondew Shop in Dallas, highly recommend.)

I spoke with the manager (Marshall) and he asked me if there were any warning lights on.

I said, ""No.""

He asked, ""Did the AutoZone guy have you turn on your headlights or AC when the engine was idling and he was testing it?"" Me: ""No, it was just on idle.""

He said, ""Don't worry, the tester was giving a false reading, because Honda alternators don't run unless they're needed, and on idle, the tester wouldn't detect any voltage because the alternator is resting. I guarantee that if you'd turned on your headlights and AC, there would be a voltage flow, and the tester would have reported a good charging system.""

He added, ""Over the years we've had a lot of people who got reports like these from AutoZone and other stores, replaced perfectly good original alternators with crappy aftermarket ones, then bring them to us because the aftermarket ones poop out on them. The only fix is to put in an OEM Honda alternator.""

""The only original Accord alternator I've seen in the shop that needed replacing was in a 2017 Accord with 215,000 miles which was spitting out little bits of metal because of a bearing failure.""

Me: ""Thanks very much, that's a relief."" 

And so far, zero problems with the new battery.

Most of the time, when I start my car first thing in the morning I have starting issues.  

When I initially attempt to start it consistently does one of three things:

1. nothing happens at all (I do not recall hearing a click)
2. the car turns very weakly and doesn't start
3. the car turns very weakly and does start
4. Rarely, it will start with a strong start

Of course if the car starts, I just drive and don't do any other testing.

If it doesn't start, I will wait briefly (5-10 seconds) and try again.  Then it will typically progress through the list.  If it was doing #1 then it will typically do #2 or #3.  If it was #2 then it might do #3 (it rarely does #4).  It hasn't gone backwards through the list yet - I have not had it do #2 and then on the next attempt do #1.



I don't know if this is meaningful information but:

I'm thinking it might start better after the key its in the ignition on the ""on"" position for a bit.  When the car doesn't start, I don't take the key out, I wait to try again with the ignition on the ""on"" position.  Yesterday, I was working to a bluetooth MicroMechanic hooked up to my car and the instructions said that the ignition had to be on ""on"" position before connecting to bluetooth.  I did that and then connected to my phone's bluetooth.  It took about a minute of the car being on ""on"" position before I tried starting for the first time and it was a good strong start, despite the engine being cold for about 5 hours.

Our Accord kind of had the same thing happen with a very weak start but would strong start every once in a while.  It seemed like a power problem because the brushes in the starter were so worn.

I have a 2018 Nissan versa (about 110k miles) and it has this ongoing issue. Recently my car keeps stopping and turning off while driving, or while stopped at a red light. I've taken it to a mechanic and at first they thought it was the mass air flow sensor so they replaced it, but that didn't fix it and a few days later it stopped again. Then next, they thought it was the MAF socket and replaced that and it drove okay for a few days and again started stopping while driving.

1m6f7c4,MAF sensor replacement for 2012 Lexus Ls460,"My 2012 Lexus Ls460 has been giving me issues. I got my oil changed at Walmart &amp; after about a week, I noticed a small leak. It wasn't that bad at first so I kust topped it off every couple of weeks, but the leak just got progressively worse. I tried replacing the gasket on the oil filter housing, where the leak was coming from, but ended up just needing to replace the entire oil filter housing cap. 

I was about to take it to a friend of mines shop to replace the housing cap &amp; when I went to crank up my car, it immediately stalled after it turned over &amp; the check engine &amp; traction control light were on. It cranked right up the 2nd time &amp; everytime I crank the engine it does this. When I tried to drive it, I immediately noticed that there was very little power going to the engine when I pressed the gas &amp; my car had put itself in limp mode. When I checked the check engine light code, it came back saying that it's the Maf sensor. I cleaned both Maf sensors with the right cleaner, but it's still giving me problems so I need to replace them.

Maf sensors vary greatly in price from $18 to $200 online. Auto zone has them for $80, but I know that they sometimes will charge a lot more than a part is really worth. **Will a cheaper MAF sensor from Walmart, Amazon, or Ebay be reliable? Is there a big difference in dependability between the more expensive ones or they all about the same? &amp; could it be anything other than the MAF sensor that could be an issue from the oil leak that could trigger a check engine code for the MAF sensor?**

Two times now, when starting my petrol car in the morning and letting it run stationary for a while, I notice 3 things:

\- my RPM meter is going somewhat up and down

\- I feel every 5 seconds or so, coinciding with the RPM meter going up again, a little ""shake"" or rattle in the car, and this is also visible under the bonnet. The engine block shakes. Just before it shakes, you can hear a little ""whispering"" squeak.

This can be seen in the video.

Also, once now, after a while, a more prominent loud whistle, squeak, sound became clear at the same pace intervals as the rest. 

Anyone have any idea what this might be and whether or not I can still drive it? Once you drive, even if you put your foot on the gas once, the whole thing is gone! Also, starting with warm engine also gives no troubles so far and during driving the engine acts completely normal!

Cleaning the sensor is Really easy and doesn't take much for tools. Usually just a flat blade screw driver or pliers to get it loose. The belt can be tricky especially if you haven't done one before... And it's best practice to replace the tensioner with the belt because they both wear out over time.

However, you can read the data on a scan tool and determine if the sensor or converter is bad without guessing, which is what you are doing now. Save yourself some time, money and frustration and learn to read the scan tool data. Simply comparing the O2 data for the upstream and downstream sensors will tell you what's bad, along with a non-contact thermometer to measure cat temp. There are YouTube vids explaining how.

Lately, I’ve noticed that when I press the throttle while driving around 50 km/h, the car starts to shake a bit. I took it to my trusted mechanic, who changed the spark plugs—but that didn’t fix the issue.

So I brought it to the dealer. They inspected it and said it needed a valve adjustment to improve airflow. That didn’t really help either. After that visit, they suddenly came back with a whole list of other problems:

Here’s what they found:

* The fuel line underneath the car is rotten and needs replacing
* Transmission oil filter and fluid need replacing
* Both left and right tie-rod end boots need replacement

The thing is, I feel like the fuel line issue should’ve been caught right away when the car was on the lift. To make things worse, when I asked for a price estimate, they said they’d need to inspect it again—and of course, that means paying for another diagnosis. So at this point, I don’t really want to take it back to the dealer.

* Is it dangerous to keep driving it like this until it gives out completely?

1m6kpbb,2017 Hyundai Accent - Stumped,"I’m wracking my brain on this one. I’ll try and be precise with the issues as possible: 

So I purchased this vehicle for my son as a starter car, he just turned 17, and it has about 95K miles on it . Did great for the first month or so with no issues. Had to change out the water pump and a pulley about 90 days after purchase then things were good about another month or so. 

Shortly after that, my son told me that while driving down the highway his A/C would be turned on full blast, and for no reason it seemed like it would lose power, kind of like you had it on the highest setting and then turned it down to the lowest. He said after a minute or so, it would kick back up to full power so I didn’t think too much of it. Then a couple of weeks after that, he said he was sitting at a four-way stop and his car just completely lost power. Was running fine and making no noises and then it just completely went dead. He turned the key to the off position, then cranked it, and it started right up and he drove it home. My first thought was that maybe the battery was going bad or the alternator. 

Took it to AutoZone and they tested the battery which was good, but the initial test on the charging system failed. This led me to believe that my assumption about the alternator going bad was correct. But then as the car ran and employee continued to test the battery he said no actually, your alternator is doing its job. Nothing is losing charge so that could’ve been an incorrect reading. I was still leaning toward it, possibly being an alternator. 

That evening, my son was driving to football practice and while driving down a side road, the car just completely loses power while he was turning the corner. He is able to coast it off on to a side street, thankfully. He was able to restart it and drive it about three more miles to get to football practice. At that point I went and left him my car and decided to drive his car home. I’m still thinking it’s something electrical with the alternator, so I turned the radio off and the AC off for the drive home and roll the windows down and I did not have an issue. 

The next morning while taking the car to the shop, with everything turned off regarding the AC and radio it dies on me at a red light. Started right up after dying, and I am able to get it to my mechanic which was about 8 miles away. My mechanic has now had the car for four days and he has tried everything to get it to replicate the issues we were having. Nothing is triggering for him. He cannot get the car to die on him at all. He said he has driven it with the radio on, the AC, took it on the highway, everything. Can’t get it to do what it was doing before at all. There are no error codes, and there are no dashboard lights coming on. He has tried to scan it and is getting zero error codes. I really would like to get his car back for him, but only if it’s safe to drive.

Lately, I’ve noticed that when I press the throttle while driving around 50 km/h, the car starts to shake a bit. I took it to my trusted mechanic, who changed the spark plugs—but that didn’t fix the issue.

So I brought it to the dealer. They inspected it and said it needed a valve adjustment to improve airflow. That didn’t really help either. After that visit, they suddenly came back with a whole list of other problems:

Here’s what they found:

* The fuel line underneath the car is rotten and needs replacing
* Transmission oil filter and fluid need replacing
* Both left and right tie-rod end boots need replacement

The thing is, I feel like the fuel line issue should’ve been caught right away when the car was on the lift. To make things worse, when I asked for a price estimate, they said they’d need to inspect it again—and of course, that means paying for another diagnosis. So at this point, I don’t really want to take it back to the dealer.

* Do you think I should go ahead with the repairs?
* Is it dangerous to keep driving it like this until it gives out completely?",1,1753180491.0,5,mechanic,1753304285,2025-07-22 10:34:51,2025-07-23 20:58:05,"guntheretherethere (Score: 2): Have your mechanic do a compression and leak down test test to check the valves.

1m68rc0,Help :( rattling ticking noise,"
Hi everyone,

A few months ago, I bought a 2012 Honda Insight (Hybrid, 1.3 i-VTEC, ~228,000 km / 142,000 miles). It’s actually my second Insight — my first one got totaled while I was on holiday by a drunk driver who crashed into it while it was parked 😢

After I got back home, I needed a car quickly, and I loved my old one so much that I went with another Insight. It seemed to be in good condition, but sadly I think I’ve been scammed — it had hidden issues and was poorly maintained.

The biggest issue right now is a ticking or clicking sound that appears between 1500 and 2000 RPM, only under load. Here’s what I’ve noticed:

•	⁠Only when driving — never when idling
•	⁠Not present when the engine is cold (first 5–10 minutes)
•	⁠Always under load, even with very light acceleration, Rpm related
•	⁠The sound disappears above 2000 RPM
•	⁠i can “hold” the sound steady by keeping my foot in just the right position
•	⁠Not related to wheel speed, road speed, or air conditioning
•	⁠It doesn’t sound like a worn bearing — no grinding, whining, or metallic rubbing. It’s more of a sharp, rhythmic ticking or clicking.

The car still drives well, pulls fine, no power loss, no CVT slipping. There is a check engine light on, but otherwise the engine idles and runs smoothly. Multiple mechanics have looked at it, but they didn’t hear the noise until I drove the car with them.

It burns a lot of oil — about 1 liter every 600–800 km (400–500 miles). I’ve heard this is common with older Hondas, but it still seems extreme.
•	⁠Recent oil and filter changes didn’t change anything
•	⁠The water pump pulley has a very slight wobble, but my dad and others say it doesn’t sound like a bearing issue
•	⁠Heat shields and exhaust have been visually checked — nothing seems loose

Possible causes people have suggested:

•	⁠Piston rings (oil control rings): I’ve heard there was a known service bulletin or recall for this engine — the rings were too narrow and tend to stick, possibly causing ticking or piston slap.
•	⁠Hybrid electric motor (IMA system): Some people think it might be internal bearing or drivetrain wear.
•	⁠CVT transmission: A trusted mechanic suspects the noise could be coming from the metal drive belt or the pulleys inside the CVT, especially under load.

These are all just guesses at this point, but I’m really hoping someone here might recognize the specific RPM-dependent ticking pattern or has seen something similar.

I’m not a native English speaker and don’t know much about car terminology, so I apologize if anything isn’t clear!

I’ve attached two audio recordings — I held the gas steady to “lock in” the sound when it was most noticeable:

https://jmp.sh/s/h0Xc07vvISlYULMEWb6y https://jmp.sh/s/etsleuQhfWkIF30VuRoi

Thanks so much for reading. I’m honestly feeling kind of desperate — I don’t know who to trust anymore, and I feel like mechanics here take advantage of me because I’m young and a woman who knows nothing about cars.

Next would be transmission. Does it have a CVT or automatic? My honda element sounds like this around 40-45 under light load and its a valve in the torque converter, common issue with mine and more of an annoyance than anything.

Third guess is ugly, but it could also be a rod bearing, but it doesn't do it consistently under load through all rpm, right? So not really leaning towards that.

I'd check all fluid levels first and go from there.

Edit: i need a coffee, clearly. Disregard the transmission one, yours is cvt."

1m66da5,Engine replaced…mechanic turned off ac.,"Had the engine replaced on my wife’s 2017 kia minivan because it seized. Got it back from the mechanic and noticed the AC wasn’t working. Called the mechanic who did the work and he said he turned it off on purpose and will turn it back on after 2,000 miles. But we barely drive 2,000 miles in a year (we both work from home). We have two small kids and it’s summer and next week is going to be in the high 80s. Is this normal procedure? Should he have turned it back on? I don’t want to complain if this is normal routine but…can anyone advise? TIA

Editing to add what I added below:

Thanks for all the responses! To fill in missing info…he never told me why it seized. He said “poor maintenance and that the oil was sludgy.” We’d just had the oil changed at jiffy lube when it broke. He told me he ordered a new engine, took about 5 days to get the vehicle back. He also told me not to drive over 60mph for those 2,000 miles. Then he wants me to bring it back to “check that it’s all working ok.” He never mentioned the AC until I got home and called him. He’s got a big shop here in town that a lot of people go to and when AAA towed the car they recommended him because he’s on their list of approved mechanics. 

Yes the engine is new. I checked. Different color from the last one. 

I guess my last question before I either take it back or call a new mechanic is would he be concerned about an oil issue messing up the new engine and would AC have anything to do with that? I don’t want to accuse him of anything before I understand it all. Like, is he genuinely being overly concerned or was this an error. All it does is blow hot air now.

Thanks again!

Update #2:  Went to the dealership, spoke to 2 mechanics. Both said there’s no reason the AC should be disabled and that it doesn’t affect a refurbished engine. They also said drive it like I normally would. So I’m taking it back to the shop later to have him turn it back on. Hopefully he just does it without an issue. 

FINAL Edit: Took it back. He put the Freon back in. No charge. He said it was because the new engine is under warranty and he didn’t want to create stress on it until it was broken in.

I was thinking of attempting this job myself. I've done quite a few things myself and feel this wouldn't be so hard. I already purchased a compressor and will get a new condenser (drier/receiver affixed), expansion valve, and may a new suction &amp; discharge line assembly, if necessary.

I will have a professional at a shop, maybe diagnose it and discharge the system, if needed. He quoted me $1600 parts and labor. I've replaced the starter on this car and have also had to remove the serpentine belt a few times to do other things so I know what I'm dealing with as far as the compressor. Also, I replaced the radiator, which is literally right up against the condenser. The expansion valve might be challenging, but if the few videos I watched are somewhat accurate, I think I can do it. Don't think I have to remove the whole dashboard.

Any advice anyone here can give me or anyone with experience can share. Hopefully, someone here has taken on this same task on this same year make and model.

If so, it is normal to change the compressor, accumulator, and orifice tube. The condenser would only be changed if they found debris from the compressor had contaminated the system. If that is the case, then you will have to flush the system. If the compressor didn’t send particles throughout the system, then you can replace those first three parts, then take it down and have the system evacuated and charged. Everything can be changed with simple hand tools, with the exception of the orifice tube. If you’re lucky, you can remove it with a pair of needle nose pliers.

Very important that you have the right amount of oil. Get a gauge set for R134a. You also MUST vacuum the system out. Any tiny speck of anything in there will have you replace everything again. I use a standard single stage vacuum pump. Pull it down for 10 minutes, close the gauge valve and let it sit for 15 minutes to see if it leaks. If the gauge doesn't move, put in the UV dye. This is so you will be able to find a leak if it happens. Fill it with the exact amount of R134a that is on the tag under the hood. There are a million videos out there to show you how to do all of this. Every system works basically the same. I have been doing this for decades. It isn't rocket surgery. Tools required:

Need help diagnosing a brake pulsation I feel in the seat and steering wheel. I notice it more when getting off exit ramps when braking at higher speeds. I took it to Toyota last week and said my rear drums were “out of round” and my front rotors and pads were “aftermarket”. They did a full brake job including new pads and rotors in the front and new drums in the rear. All genuine Toyota parts. They also said they found a broken hose caliper and my wheel alignment was off. They corrected all that. However the brake pulsation is still there and very noticeable. I’m taking it back to Toyota in a couple days. I’m very upset as I dropped a lot of money to get these repairs done, and the problem is still there. Has anyone else experienced this?

Talked with Seat and them weren't able to help neither, once they only access ekta and sell the parts - but they were amazing trying to help, and giving infos tbh. So I really need the proper manual, there is no other way. Also I need to check and test some other parts in the car, so, ekta/similar doesn't help on that. 

So, which place is possible to get useful workshop Manuals, and software? I've found MHH site which seemed to have some good material, but it's useless, once that no one replies to the asked login for years lol - most people are already aware about that. Also find haynes online workshop manual, it seemed to me a really great option and was whiling to buy the access, but read the reviews and mainly they were all negative telling that the software it's well thought out , but in the end doest serve the purpose and it lacks many essential infos, and that its still better to use the ""old"" haynes manuals on paper (lol).

I've found an Russian website who has some manuals and schemes, but it's super confusing and doesn't have all that it's needed, just random Manuals parts and schemes here and there, and all mixed up with wrong names. 

The seat/other brands forums were good on the old days. Nowadays posts are old and have lost their pictures links (who are essential to understand) and few people use forums nowadays, so any question posted got no replies. 



So appreciate if you guys can tell which are the essential websites to have bookmarked to search infos, manuals and schemes about this subject :)

You can easily see this by putting a car on a lift and reving it up in gear. You'll find the RPMs increase effortlessly due to lack of load on the wheels.

If you reduce mechanical advantage and increase the force required, then each stroke is taking longer to release the force of ignition, meaning it's pushing on everything hard for longer.

1m6on0y,Priorities for my 2004 Grand Prix fixes,"Hello everyone.

Recently, my main mode of transportation started giving me some issues, forcing me to switch to my backup car. However, the Back Up car has it's own issues. It'll drive (we just got a new battery for it) but I don't want to let problems fester.

We took it to our local shop. Dad and the mechanics looked at the engine and Identified three issues.

I am for sure getting the Eblow/L bit/ whatever replaced with a metal component so it'll last longer; both of them. We have a quote for that.

However, they also identified the serpentine belt and spark plugs as eventual issues that will need to be addressed. My question is which of those is the most important of those issues? I plan to get them all fixed closely within one another if not all at once. Which one should I prioritize, alongside the L Bit/Elbow piece?

And if possible, what are the itemized range of costs I'm looking at? They gave me almost 400$ for the Elbow Piece (The Spark Plugs and Serpentine belt were similarly around 400-450$ for parts and services) which I can pay no problem, but we didn't get ***any*** service done because dad wants to shop around more even though the whole idea was we were going to go drop it off. I need this car up and att'em by Friday though and I don't have time for dad bullshitting around. He's told me he'll have a better solution by tomorrow and if it falls through, we'll go back to the first mechanics and get the needed services.

If it were you, what order would you do the above needed fixes? Thanks!

1m6ok25,"2021 VW Atlas PCV Failure/Leaking, Extended Warranty Issues","Hi friends, curious if this has happened to any other Volkswagen Atlas drivers, or anyone else;

My car is a 2021, I've had it a little over 3 months, and it has about 70,000 miles. I also have an extended warranty policy on my car. I noticed oil leakage about a month ago (no warning lights on the dash, I just noticed leakage on my driveway), so I called the dealership to get an appointment for service and was seen yesterday. It was diagnosed with ‘2 items failed needing immediate attention’:

1. PCV breather failure, causing too much internal pressure. Requires replacement. ($451.08)
2. Found leaks in 4 cam actuators. Caused by overpressuring the cam case. Requires replacement. ($1060.72). The dealership mechanic quoted me at about $2000, including a $210 diagnostic fee. He said after back and forth with my extended warranty people, they are not covering anything because “They explained that your plan does not list the requested part as a covered component, so they documented the denial on their end.”

So first, why tf am I paying for an extended warranty if they pick and choose which parts they feel like covering? And second, has anyone else had this happen to their Atlas? When I dropped the car off, the woman who helped me fill out some paperwork and walk through the issue said that they have seen this exact issue in multiple Atlases and Tiguan’s. So i was sold this car, three months ago, with these issues being known in most of the same models...

I don’t know exactly what I'm asking here, just hoping to hear from other people who may have experienced this issue, or possibly get some advice about where to go next. The dealership did have a 3-month warranty on my car, and I made the service appointment 3 months and 10 days after I bought it, so it was 10 days outside of the 3-month warranty. 

Please be gentle, I'm young and NOT car-savvy, and just at a loss for words. I pay through the nose every month for this car, and am just lost and confused, and so sad because this was my dream car.

I have a 2014 Ford Explorer Sport (3.5L EcoBoost, built April 21, 2014). My engine is blown, and I’m having trouble finding a good used or reman engine from a 2013–early 2014 model, which I’ve heard is what I need.

However, I keep seeing engines from 2015–2019 Explorers listed as compatible with mine. I’ve talked to dealers, sellers, and even Ford corporate, but I’m still getting mixed answers. Some say they’re interchangeable as long as I swap over sensors, wiring, or the valve covers. Others say the 6/2/2014 date is a hard cutoff due to internal changes.

	•	What components (if any) need to be swapped to make it work?
	•	Has anyone here personally done a swap on a pre-June 2014 Explorer Sport?
	•	Should I stick with an older engine to be safe, or is this all overblown?

Took it to be inspected to one mechanic and they told me it needed a sway bar, control arms, and u joints to pass. Quoted me $800. 

I called BS because there was no indication any of those things were bad. Took it to a second mechanic and they found none of those things to be wrong, which confirmed that the first guys were full of it, but did say the rear bumper support needed to be replaced. Quoted me $600 for it. I found the parts online for $80.

I wonder though about that, because diagnosing such a thing requires that the rear bumper cover be taken off to see that the bumper support is bad (they said it was rotting). Doing a state inspection doesn’t typically require removing the bumpers. 

How would they have discovered that the bumper support was bad? Am I wrong here? This doesn’t make sense to me.

When i got it, the exhaust was rusted out pretty bad and I got multiple exhaust leak codes. Had a buddy do an exhaust and cat kit on it. 

I did get a few more leak codes after that, so he did the charcoal canister, return line, purge. It did well for a few thousand miles. 

Since then, the main code has been a p0420. Which i know is a bad converter code. And I should probably get it to a legit exhaust shop at some point. But I'm wondering, 

Can something else be throwing the code, causing the loss of power? Feels like a misfire at 1500-2500 RPM 

Today, I finally got tired of waiting on people and looked for leaks. Turns out the kids at valvoline pulled my air intake cover off and did not put it back on all the way... so it had a big gap. Probably drove like that a few thousand miles. 

Could that cause a air/fuel mixture issue that cause other things to fail? 

Anything I should check? Normally my go-to here would be spark plugs, wires, an 02 sensor, or cleaning the throttle body.

1m6hg02,Car goes to limp mode after mechanic repaired an oil leak,"

Hi everyone, I’m looking for some help with my 2016 Holden Cascada (also known as Buick, opel, or Vauxhall Cascada outside Australia) from someone who knows a bit more about cars than I do. I’m 19, new to owning cars, and am not knowledgeable at all on how engines work.

So my car was leaking oil when I first got it, and I took it to Holden to get it repaired. The car had no issues prior to taking it to them, but things went downhill fast. They quoted me $2700 for the fix, and when I went to pick it up a week later it was only $1500, and they told me they did a “cheaper repair” which when I went to get a roadworthy for the car, revealed that the engine was still leaking oil.

I took it back to them, and ended up waiting almost 3 months to get my car back this time. They never gave me any updates, and only when I called them about it was I told that they had to give the car to another automotive engineer as there was an issue with a belt or chain or something that needed to be fixed. When I picked up my car, I paid the remaining $1200 and thought all would be fine.

A couple days later, my check engine light came on. I took it to another mechanic near me to get the codes read quickly, which were P0011, P0014, P0016, and P0017, all ECU codes relating to camshaft/crankshaft position. This mechanic cleared the codes and told me that it could possibly be faulty sensors, but I should keep the report and take it back to the mechanic if the check engine light comes on again.

Over the next few weeks, I noticed that my car seemed to be struggling with acceleration after short drives. If the car had been running for at least 10ish minutes, or was idling too long, my car would become unbearably slow accelerating. After doing a bit of research, it seems like it could possibly be going into limp mode, but I’m not entirely sure as I can still get it up to 100km/h when it’s doing this, and it changes gears fine. I took the car to the original mechanic again, explained the issue, gave them the report from the other mechanic with the ECU codes, and got my car back a week later with a new oil filter, because apparently that was the issue. Crazy enough, it wasn’t.

The car did the same thing of being unbearably slow, and when the check engine light finally came on again I took it back to the mechanic, because last time the light still hadn’t come back on. This time, I got my car back after about a week, and they said they had “given it a new solenoid”. Unfortunately I have no idea what this means, but I thought that might have fixed it, but no. I also received a lecture from the owner about how this car is costing him so much money, but I feel like it’s extremely unfair for them to be mad at me when they caused this issue?

My car still does the exact same thing where after a short drive it will be so slow accelerating that it actually causes issues in traffic, when normally it’s such a beautiful car to drive. The check engine light hasn’t come on again yet, so I’m not sure if the issue causing the check engine light to come on was fixed, or if those error codes had anything to do with it being slow in the first place.

Could anyone tell me if those codes would be causing this issue, and if the repair that the mechanic did at first could be what has led to my car being slow? 
If the mechanic is the cause of this as well, can I keep taking it back to them until they actually fix the issue?",6,1753198790.0,16,AskMechanics,1753304285,2025-07-22 15:39:50,2025-07-23 20:58:05,"Personal_Dot_2215 (Score: 9): Mechanic is either lost or not telling you something.

1m6gb65,Need Help to Vet for correct 2017 CX/5 Transaxle,"Two months ago I purchased a 2017 CX-5 GT that was traded in to a non-MAZDA dealer. It has the whining issue, covered most recently in the MAZDA TSB 05-005/20. That TSB explains the VINS of various Mazda models and years for which this whining issue is determined to be due to bearings damaged by improper configuration of the transaxle case. Of course, at the time the warranties were effective, MAZDA encouraged replacement for people that happened to come in with the complaint. Not enough people complained to initiate a recall. Therefore, it may be just a matter of time for cars within those VIN ranges to start having this problem but - guess what? You would note that, in the referenced prior TSBs, their solution was simply to replace the transaxles however, you would have to make sure that it is replaced with one of the modified ones for which I think the transaxle serial number ranges are now given.

But, wait - doesn't that mean that, if you replace the transaxle with a compatible yet non-listed serial numbered one, you are at risk of installing another transaxle with the same improperly configured case? Would that mean it would again be a matter of time for those transaxle bearings to also go bad? I would think that only MAZDA would have a database of transaxle serial numbers to match the original VINs, of course not publicly available. Perhaps the dealer would have access to that info? Am I being logical here?

How are we to know which used ones can be rebuilt with the proper case modification? Can they even be thus properly rebuilt? If not, wouldn't that reduce, if not eliminate, any core charge refund? Am I right in understanding that a non-factory/ non-OEM rebuilt transaxle with a serial number lower than in the TSB likely won't include the case modification? Should non-MAZDA shops be expected to check for TSBs? Would they basically replace the damaged bearings, spruce up the rest and call it ""rebuilt""? How can we know what cores these transaxles are being replaced with by anyone? Am I overthinking this?

This dealer's used car warranty (not CPO) is extended while that dealer or his agents are is in possession of the car so I haven't had the car since late May. They just agreed to send the car to MAZDA for diagnosis. I just want to have my questions ready. Thoughts?

UPDATE: I asked for a MAZDA multi-point inspection (usually free when already in for service) so I would know what to budget maintenance for in case I kept the car since only powertrain issues that come up would be related to my claim. Wouldn't you know that the selling dealer's service advisor called to say that MAZDA techs heard nothing after test driving the car a couple of times. Then the selling dealer texted that the car is ready for pickup.

Question 1: Am I understanding correctly that the most efficient, cost-effective, and reliable way to vet a transmission for a modified case is to get a factory-rebuilt transaxle?

Question 2: Obviously, the car isn't ready for pickup because it isn't repaired. It seems convenient for them to push the car out of warranty based on that ""diagnosis"" while no one mentioned using a mechanic's stethoscope. Since under warranty only while under dealer's control, I couldn't take the car to a transmission shop for diagnosis and recommendations.

1m69diu,My car makes weird noises. Should I see a mechanic and how do I avoid getting scammed?,"English is not my first language and I have no clue about cars so please bear with me. I am in Germany and drive a manual Ford Ecosport.

 Last month my car didn't pass technical inspection because some axis? holding the front wheels in line was corroding. The damage was bad enough to fail the inspection but not so bad that I couldn't drive home and later to a garage. The inspector said this is normal and can happen on it's own or when you hit like a high curb. I took it to a mechanic and asked to not only fix the damage but to also check if it would make sense to preemptively replace anything yet. They fixed the problem, changed the batteries in the tyre sensors and it passed the inspection. They assured me that everything else was totally fine and I wouldn't need to return unless a warning light would turn on on the dashboard. Now, one month later, my car has started making weird noises in first and second gear only. Third, fourth and fifth gear are normal and ""silent"". It sounds like a hollow rattling and a very faint squeeking noise. The rattling sound happens on uneven terrain like potholes and cobblestone streets, so the majority of german roads. The squeeking is only heard when I break and turn the wheel at the same time. So when I stop at a red light on a straight path it doesn't squeek. There are no lights on on my dashboard so I was wondering if I might be just paranoid or not. There was no light on when the axis thing happened either so it's safe to assume that the car doesn't alert me to every problem it might have? My mom said that animals sometimes climb inside cars and break stuff but I don't think that is the case. It's parked in a large parking garage with several hundred spots and a machine that makes a high pitched sound to deter any animals. 

So my questions are:

1. Could it be that some part wore off in the last month and it needs replacing?

2. Or did the mechanic make a mistake like not tightening the screws?

3. I'm a broke college student and I've been scammed by garages in the past. They charged for things that they never did and I only noticed because they charged me to replace the gas tank lid but it was still broken (somebody had siphoned my gas apparently). In the next garage they told me that the other's had scammed me and ""fixed their mistakes"". Months later I went to a third garage to put on my winter tyres where they told me the second one had scammed me. I've probably paid thousands of Euros for nonexistent problems. The mechanics that fixed my axis seemed a lot nicer. They are pretty young, just startes their business and tried to explain everything to me. They assured me that everything else was totally in order and gave me an appointment card for several months away for a general insurance required check up. So my last question is: how the hell do I avoid getting scammed? 3 garages apparently overcharged and now I'm worried that the fourth one might have done it too.",1,1753175969.0,3,AskMechanics,1753304285,2025-07-22 09:19:29,2025-07-23 20:58:05,"Radiant_Street_5448 (Score: 1): First and second gear are low speed gears.

Hopefully they are respectful and will take care of the car and you in terms of scams. 

For help on not getting scammed, find a friend who knows cars or is into them so they can double check everything.

Wife's car is a 2015 Hyundai Tucson with 51k miles. Automatic, FWD, I think its the 2.4 but can't remember off hand. Her car is having a very intermittent A/C issue. Most of the time, it blows ice cold air. Very randomly and not often, and without changing any settings, it'll just start blowing ambient air. This is very intermittent as there are no real ways to replicate it. It doesn't matter if it's a drive down the road or down the highway, it will just randomly blow ambient air for about 3-5 minutes.

Now I noticed when the A/C would finally blow cold again, the engine will shudder/bog down for a moment. Then we're back in business of ice cold air. There have been times when we can drive 50 miles on the highway and no issues. But sometimes it'll act up just going to the grocery store.

I swung by a reputable shop by me that I trust. They were able to fit me in momentarily since they're overbooked and do a quick diagnosis. They had it for a few hours and could never replicate the issue both idling in the shop, and on a 5 mile test drive. No codes to pull up, and hooking up to gauges showed it was within spec (don't ask me numbers as I don't know).

2008 Mitsubishi Outlander  - ""Special RustBelt Edition"" 230,000km Engine size: 3L, Auto

Messed up and got some abs sensor bits in the hub (rear wheel)...might have possibly hit abs ring too, unsure.

Was helping a friend (&amp; neighbor) with his very rusted out old Outlander.  ""Salt and Snow"" land.

Friend is a broke retired pensioner.  He doesn't have money, I do, so I help out when I can, e.g when he has vehicle issues I'll just buy and install the parts as needed.  (He assists me with things he is capable of doing too - great relationship)

Vehicle is old and rusted to hell - even frame is not good - jacking up needs to be done carefully etc.  ABS etc hasn't worked for years. He hit the brakes the other day, and one of the hard brake lines burst.  I replaced that for him, and the few other lines that looked bad, also did a complete overhaul on his brakes and various other things while it was up.  Also found broken wiring (rear, central) that looked to be part of the 4WD so I fixed that too.

Vehicle is (was) 2wd/4wd selectable, but that hasn't worked for years - I always assumed that was because of broken ABS sensors. (Code scan confirms).

Anyhow, thought it might be a nice gift to try get his 4wd working again for him (Lots of snow here).

Rear ABS sensor: Bolt head long gone, presumably snapped off by someone years ago.  (Will be fun trying to get that thread out later ;)  So, abs sensor was not sitting flush (at all..), lots of entry for the elements..  One wire already broken...

Went to remove the ""utterly seized"" abs sensor...tried the propane torch and screw...nothing would budge...even with a good lever setup.  First screw just broke in the end (#8 Decking Screw), went back with a #10 Steel screw...more heat etc...couldn't get it to budge (backing out the screw a bit...we were just able to get small bits out at a time...)

Was getting late...tired...ended up just trying to drill the rest out...was dumb/tired and didn't put a depth-stop on my drill...And pulling the (rusted hub assembly) off at that time didn't seem a reasonable option.

Got it out, but def some ""crud"" fell into the wheel hub, and saw some brown rust-dust at the end of the drill, as well as the plastic.   Can now look through the abs hole and see movement when I turn the wheel.

TLDR/TIFU: Some crap fell into the hub.  Fair chance I nicked the sensor ring/teeth or something in the hub too.

Wheel made a wee bit of a grinding noise when turning by hand, and when driving, for about 10 minutes only - then normal - no sound - I presume just because whatever fell it got ground to dust.

I immediately offered to buy him a new hub, I can afford it - he doesn't want me to spend that money on his old car - everything else on it is pretty f\*\*ked anyway. plus there is the question off what other cans of worms might we open by changing the hub on this old car - e.g potential snapped bolt heads or whatever.

\---

MAIN QUESTION: How dangerous is this?  Is there any chance of sudden catastrophic failure? Is there even a small chance this could e.g cause the wheel to seize while driving, without any prior warning/issues?  

(Because if that is a possibility, obv I will arrange a new hub installed. He is anti-that idea for now - but if this presents a real safety issue, that will change things...)

Or is it more of a just ""might slowly cause issues over time"" kinda thing? Not Urgent?

\----

Other question: For a ""supersiezed"" ABS sensor, thats basically had a broken off cap for years, far more seized than any thing I have seen on youtube, how else could I have got it out, without removing the hub? When screws and heat didn't work?  Just completely melted it and bit-by-bit with a pick?  There must be some non-plastic parts in the sensor?

The rotating axle is going to pick the pieces of plastic up and eventually they’ll be ground to something small enough they won’t hurt anything.

If any ferrous metal bits are in there, then they’ll stick to the magnet and possibly interfere with the signal such that the ABS light will stay on. 

Generally, with seized ABS sensors you need to remove the CV shaft to give you a clear path to punch it out.  On some designs the bearing has to come out also."

I start the car and it jumps to about ~3k idle. Surprisingly, I don’t get any codes. I tried to let it run for 3 minutes on and off with 60 seconds between, but nothing improved. Do you think I should do a throttle re-learn with a scanner?

Mix up some dish soap, salt and water in a bottle and poke a small hole in the lid. Idle the engine and squirt water over the wires one by one, and the distributor cap. If a wire or the cap is leaking high voltage, the water will short it out, causing a misfire. Sometimes you'll see the light show if the surroundings are dark. 

If that fails to produce results, physically check the spark plugs and wires. Look for carbon tracking on the porcelain of the plug and inside the wire boot. Do the same for the cap and rotor.

I’d recommend Japanese over Korean. In about 2005, the industry abandoned press-in wheel bearings in favor of bolt-on hubs with bearings - generally much easier to deal with.  No more than light rust on the underbody - if in the US rust belt, look southward.

**His Description:**

I think my son's 2017 Mazda CX-5 with 73K miles has a serious issue with its automatic transmission. The symptoms, which only start after the car has been driven for at least 15 minutes and after hitting speeds of at least 40-45 mph are (1) a brief ""thunk"" when starting from a full stop, (2) a delay shifting into higher gear as you accelerate and (3) most commonly, a rhythmic thumping sound as you drive, which in its most extreme version will cause the car to shake violently.  This video includes a moderate example of all 3 symptoms but they don't always occur at the same time and it is hard to predict when they will occur and sometimes they start and stop mid-drive. The local mechanic drained and filled the transmission fluid and the Mazda dealer said they couldn't recreate the problems and nothing appeared to be wrong, meaning there were no trouble codes or visible leaks - I didn't have this video before taking it to the dealer so I couldn't share it with them. One thing that is confusing to me is during symptom # 3 (rhythmic thump), I put the car into neutral while driving downhill and it had no effect on the [thump.Am](http://thump.Am) I right about the transmission?  If so, can it be repaired and/or is it worthwhile to replace or rebuild?

Could also be a dragging brake caliper that has led to a warped brake rotor.

Could be a list of other things, it’s possible wheel bearings or even motor mounts can cause this. Hard to tell without the car in front of me, but Id feel pretty confident that most competent mechanics could figure it out. Sounds like he just had bad luck with those other shops

The thing is though that I've very recently got my rear shocks replaced. Also just a few days ago I replaced the front strut assemblies. Also my tires are fairly new.. Yet the issue persists.

My theory is that it may be ball joints going bad or something else which connects the tires to the front. Considering that my steering wheel is dead flat but the wheels seem to be moving around independently.

Slightly expand the pinch joint in the spindle, you can take an Alan key, punch it in lightly with a hammer and twist it to keep it expanded.

Apply a bit of lubricant to the ball joint to help it slide in. 

The ball joint needs to be PERFECTLY lined up with the hole in the pinch joint for it to slide in.

You can lightly put a jack underneath the control arm and tap the assembly to shock it while the jack helps you push it in.

They can be a pain but you got this. Best of luck!


P.S. the nut on the ball joint pinch bolt is a locking nut and should be replaced. At the very least please go to a parts store and buy some blue loctite and put a bit on to keep it from coming loose, dont over-tighten  it.

1m5zl3o,Attempting to replace multiple AC parts on my own,"I got a couple of quotes on the possible need to replace multiple AC parts on a 2007 Saturn Ion-2 2.2. I was thinking of attempting this job myself. I've done quite a few things myself and feel this wouldn't be so hard. I already purchased a compressor and will get a new condenser (drier/receiver affixed), expansion valve, and may a new suction &amp; discharge line assembly, if necessary.

I will have a professional at a shop, maybe diagnose it and discharge the system, if needed. He quoted me $1600 parts and labor. I've replaced the starter on this car and have also had to remove the serpentine belt a few times to do other things so I know what I'm dealing with as far as the compressor. Also, I replaced the radiator, which is literally right up against the condenser. The expansion valve might be challenging, but if the few videos I watched are somewhat accurate, I think I can do it. Don't think I have to remove the whole dashboard.

Any advice anyone here can give me or anyone with experience can share. Hopefully, someone here has taken on this same task on this same year make and model.

1m5xvf1,Is my car okay to keep driving?,"I’d like to start off by saying I know very little about cars so any advice is appreciated.

I have a 2017 Hyundai Elantra with 161,000 miles on it. I bought it not even two years ago and still owe a lot of money on it. 

So about 6-8 months ago my car started to sputter out and die when I slowed down (under 10 mph) or came to a complete stop. If I pulled over and put it in park it would start up again no problem. Sometimes it would go awhile before it would happen again and sometimes not. The check engine light then came on and I got that looked into. It gave off the code P0017 and P0011. I looked it up and was told to replace the VVT solenoids. I replaced both intake and outtake. This seemed to help for a short amount of time before the check engine light came back on and my car started dying on me again. 

Some time went by and it started to die at start up only. When I started the car the RPMs would jump up high and then down to zero and it would die. If I gave it some gas and took off I could usually prevent it from dying and it would then drive just fine until I went to start it up again. 

I then took it to a mechanic to have it diagnosed. They told me my timing chain was likely severely damaged and was causing every cylinder to misfire. He quoted me about $4000 to fix it but really wasn’t interested in fixing it anyway because those motors go bad so he couldn’t guarantee his work. I don’t have the money to fix it at a different dealer and I didn’t know if it would even be worth it due to the potential of the engine going bad anyway like he said. So I kept driving it daily but have not been driving it long distances. The longest I’ve drove it was about maybe 120 miles round trip.

That was about 2 months ago when I took the car to the mechanic. I would say about 1 month ago the car stopped dying and drives completely fine. I can’t seem to hear any issues with the engine and it has no problems accreting, starting or anything else. It still has the engine light on and shows the same codes of P0017 and P0011.

So my questions are, should I get a second opinion? Did the car potentially fix itself since it has no issues anymore? Do you think it would be safe to drive for a 3.5 hour trip I’m planning on taking soon?

I attached a video of my engine I took today with a socket on it to show how much it’s shaking. I know it’s supposed to shake and not sound great if it’s misfiring but it doesn’t seem that bad to me. 

Thank you for your help and reading through all this. I’ve done a lot of research online and talked to a lot of people in person and cant seem to decide if I should keep driving this or not.

1m5xc7v,Passenger Front Axle Inner Boot Slinging Grease - what does this mean?,"Picture attached of issue regarding a 3.5L 2018 F150 4WD, automatic, \~80,000 miles - I was told by my local shop that my truck's ""Passenger Front Axle Inner Boot is Slinging Grease"" and I'm trying to understand the seriousness/implication of this. The proposed fixes are to:

\- Fix the passenger side axle assemble = $795.78

\- Perform a front end alignment = $175.00

My very ignorant/uneducated understanding so far:

After researching a bit I gathered the following and could be completely wrong - that this has to do specifically with the 4WD and the CV boots which are used to transfer power from transmission to different wheels when using 4WD. The CV joints (inner and outer) are covered by rubber or plastic boots filled with grease to lubricate the joints and protect them from dirt, water, and debris. The inner boot is located closer to the transmission or differential, while the outer boot is near the wheel. The inner CV boot on the passenger side front axle is likely torn or has a hole, causing the grease inside to leak out. As the axle spins during driving, this grease is flung (or “slung”) outward, often splattering on nearby components like the undercarriage or wheel well. 

1.) Is this a correct understanding? 

2.) How urgent should I address this?

3.)  If left untreated, can this result in a complete axel failure?

4.) What could cause this issue on only one axle inner boot and not others?

Thank you for your help.

If the coolant cap is on the reservoir, just top it up to the ""cold fill"" line, screw the cap back on, and drive around - the system should burp itself of any air stuck in the system over time, and all you'd need to do is top the coolant up once or twice until it's settled.

I will have a professional at a shop, maybe diagnose it and discharge the system, if needed. He quoted me $1600 parts and labor. I've replaced the starter on this car and have also had to remove the serpentine belt a few times to do other things so I know what I'm dealing with as far as the compressor. Also, I replaced the radiator, which is literally right up against the condenser. The expansion valve might be challenging, but if the few videos I watched are somewhat accurate, I think I can do it. Don't think I have to remove the whole dashboard.

Any advice anyone here can give me or anyone with experience can share. Hopefully, someone here has taken on this same task on this same year make and model.

But you will then need to find a shop willing to do a flush and fill with oil and freon AND willing to do it on a waiver so they aren't liable when all the freon leaks back out again.  If the old compressor destroyed itself there will be metal all throughout the system which may be easier to flush out \*before\* you go putting the parts in and contaminate them too.

That being said, I've done a dozen or so cars when I knew the issue was a leak at a connection or a bad evaporator/condenser verified by a freon sniffer.  Not difficult at all because there was no glitter in the system and all the oil stays in.  If it was compressor failure (unless it's just the clutch) I would highly recommend letting someone with the proper tools do the work so you can avoid ruining the new compressor.

1m6mk1q,How to quote insurance for accessory mods,"I’ve no prior experience with modifying any cars prior to this so trying work out how much it might actually cost me in regards to insurance is proving quite confusing. 

Essentially, I’m going to view and hopefully purchase a Toyota Rav 4 this weekend, and although I’ve never been one for visually moded cars in the past but I’m quite keen on making a few small changes to the rav 4 to lean a little more into the outdoor styling, please refrain from judgement lol.

Specifically, mud flaps, chrome delete, wind deflectors, ghost immobiliser which seems to count as a modification, and roof bars (for mounting roof box/rack but probably not until next year so will deal with the extra addition of the box until the time comes)

When shopping for insurance, I usually play around with the quotes a little in the comparison sites, just things like the date and such. But the modification options are very limited for the things I listed. Only a roof rack, and possibly ghost immobiliser are options on any of the menus in the sites. I’ve no idea whether the extra costs of these mostly visual mods will affect my premium much, but would like to find out if possible, as the insurance costs are already quite  high compared to previous cars I’ve had, probably due to theft rates.

The primary insurers that are appearing at competitive rates are Admiral and Hastings, so I guess the easiest answer to my question would be, have you ever declared similar kinds of mods with either of these insurers as a diver in your mid 20’s, and did it increase your premium much? 

I tried calling up to get the mods amended to quotes I had received, however the person on the end of the phone at Hastings had literally no idea what I was talking about. Admiral was more helpful and the price didn’t seem to steep, but then there is no way for me to go back into that phone quote and make any amends to see how the price is affected.

(maybe 33% cheaper for similar age and mileage).

Japan Market Forester XT 2016 / 65k km = +/- £9.5k  (pre import costs obvs)

Singapore Market Forester XT 2016 / 65k km = +/- £6k (pre import costs obvs)

I dug a little and the feeling seems to be that in Singapore people essentially 'dispose' of their cars after 10 years because of expensive tax / certification ramifications, meaning perfectly good cars are dirt cheap as they are not desirable to keep on the road there and their domestic 2nd hand market is pretty much non-existent

Someone buys a nearly new approved used car with a 2 year warranty. 3 owners 

They keep it for 3 years.

The car is now 5 years old with 3 owners and probably has a full service history from a main dealer.

If people are keeping it for a year or less that's the time to worry.

I’m looking for advice on buying my first used car and would really appreciate your input.

**My situation:**

* Budget: £20,000–£30,000 (cash buyer – does this help with negotiations?)
* Expecting our first child soon, so I need a **safe and comfortable family car**
* The car will be parked on the street (Guildford Town), used mostly on weekends, and maybe once a week for a longer work trip (a couple of hours’ drive max)
* I’d prefer something **2022 or newer** (though I’d consider anything post-2020 if it still feels modern and won’t look dated in a couple of years)
* Max mileage: 30,000
* Must be **automatic**
* Decent tech (Apple CarPlay, parking sensors, camera, etc.)
* Needs to be **reliable** – I don’t want to deal with maintenance headaches
* **Petrol**, not fully electric (no home charger), mild hybrid is okay
* I’d like to avoid the **£40k+ VED tax** if possible

**Cars I’ve been considering:**

* **Nissan Qashqai** – almost bought one due to great value, but too many issues reported online which concerns me, and it feels a bit uninspiring
* **Audi Q3** – leaning towards this at the moment; seems like a good mix of quality and value. What do you think?
* **BMW X1** – great reviews, but the design feels a bit dated to me
* **Mercedes GLA** – Seems that it could do the job, my wife doesn't love the looks
* **Mercedes GLB** – probably my favourite, but it’s at the top of my budget and crosses the £40k tax threshold, plus I assume insurance and servicing will cost more
* **Volvo XC40** – solid option, but I’m not a fan of the interior and the exterior is just okay

**What I’m after:**

Any advice on how to get the best value for my budget while also ending up with a car I’ll enjoy driving would be hugely appreciated. If there are **other cars I should consider**, please shout!

I feel really bad because we were about to sit down and purchase a policy from HastingsDirect. We managed to get the monthly quote down to £202/month with their weird blackbox key chain thingy. We were literally just about to buy it, when I told her to see if she can get it lower by changing her occupation.

So she did - she changed ""Receptionist"" to ""Secretary"" and suddenly her quote went from £202/month to £270. She changed it back: £260, and it wouldn't budge any lower. £60 QUID MORE EXPENSIVE. BECAUSE SHE MADE A CHANGE SHE REVERTED.

HastingsDirect were closed and their chatbot was only available through the app, so we held off until the next day. We called them this morning and they said they cannot honour the £202 quote because it was yesterday's quote which has expired.

I find it hard to believe that insurance companies will fuck over potential customers for trying to get the cheapest possible policy. Nobody lied. Nothing changed on the bloody policy. Nothing except the price.

Tl DR; the driving feels is worse than a BMW imo, cars good despite my personal worries and range anxiety.
Apologies in advance for the rambling thoughts.

I recently decided that my monthly fuel cost was something I no longer wanted to stick with as I was paying £250-300 per month, with the bulk of this being just to get to work and back.
I've been into cars for as long as I can remember, I'm passionate about the sounds, the feeling and the way cars drive. I enjoy a range of cars and have had over 30 in my 15 years of driving, having owned a Leon cupra, several type R's, starlet GT turbo, even recently an F80 M3, and most recently a BMW 430D they I purchased in march last year.

The BMW was my daily driver for the last 18 months and I can no longer ignore the cost for it, as servicing costs mount up so quickly, along with repairs and fuel. Cut to around 4 weeks ago when I was offered by a friend to have a go in his Model 3 dual motor. 
I obliged and was glad I did, I was quite Impressed with the power delivery, but most of all I was impressed with the build quality and the drive, considering I'd not been in one ever and only ever heard bad things about the build. I started by watching a lot of reviews of these cars, knowing I was planning to switch to an EV for cost reasons but I wanted a car, not an SUV crossover or any other strange form factor, a car. I checked out a polestar and was massively disappointed with the interior, the performance of the cars in budget and the equipment just didn't feel comparative to the model 3, so I went ahead and test drove the model Y and a 3. I found it difficult to decide which one to go for, again thinking of usability and practicality but ultimately decided the 3 would be a better fit.
I purchased the car last Sunday 13th and have done 1200 miles since. 
Being a direct comparison to my most recent car, the BMW, I find it a bit odd. It can sometimes feel like I'm not quite driving the car, I feel far less involved with the whole process of driving, something which remember, I'm passionate about. The car feels very well balanced, I put this down to feeling the weight in and around the center, not the front as per the 4 series. The driver safety aids, which are hard to complain about when considering the nature of why they are there, I would argue don't improve driver ability or skill, rather I feel over time these features will deskill drivers. I've almost forgotten what a brake pedal feels like, for a example.

That being said, the power delivery is ridiculous, it's smooth and fast, very fast. After completing 700 miles in the last 24 hours alone, my absolute biggest concerns was charging, I managed to get my charger within 5 days of purchasing the car, but have had teething problems getting the car charged to the correct level reliably, I'm still not sure my setup is correct either. Back to charging, I'm not sure why but I was always worried about being able to find a charger, how much would it cost, how long does the battery last, how accura is the range when planning the trip using the satnav. I'm pleased to report that aside from my personal gripes about the way the car feels to drive, as someone who is passionate about driver feel, this is an incredible car. The advancement in technology and most importantly the cost savings are not to be ignored. I still need more time to gel with it, but I think I've put it through it's paces this week and am looking forward to getting some more miles in.

The Dornie Hotel is a decent little place to stop for some drinks too.

As an alternative, rather than going back up towards Strathcarron to complete the NC500's route, you could just continue down the A87 towards the A82 and come back up to Inverness (if you intend to that is) via Loch Ness. We didn't do that (nor did we have time for Skye), but Fort Augustus might be an interesting little visit.

Broomfield in Ullapool was also a pretty solid site to stay at. You can nab some pictures of a great sunset looking down Loch Broom and out to sea.
