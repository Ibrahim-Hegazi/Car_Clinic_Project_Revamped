I have trip coming up on Saturday. All hotels booked, first vacation I've had in over a year. Unfortunately the check engine light came on today.

I have taken the car in to the garage a couple of times for sputtering and they have replaced coils and plugs already. It has gradually started sputtering more and more since the last visit but it is still intermittent.

If it's meaningful at all I would say the check engine light came on today the instant I put the car in neutral to go through a car wash. I would imagine it's a coincidence but it was like I hit the check light button.

Ultimately I am not sure I can have the car serviced before Saturday.

1megpyj,Does it make sense asking my mechanic these questions? (Toyota Auris),"Context:
At 41, I figured it was about time to get that friggin’ license. I know myself well enough to admit I tend to start things and not follow through. So I went ahead and bought myself a well-used Toyota Auris Hatchback, 2010 model, 1.6L petrol, manual stick. It had 159,000 km (around 98,800 miles) on it. I figured if I actually paid for the damn thing, I’d be more likely to commit and finish what I started.

Anyway, in my country there’s a mandatory vehicle inspection every two years once a car passes four years old. It results in a report listing required and recommended fixes. From what I understand, most people bring that report to a garage and base their regular service around it.

Now to my actual question:
I don’t know shit about cars — hope to learn — but in the context of trying to keep this car running for as long as possible (I paid 60,000 NOK for it; most of the value was already gone), I’m wondering if asking a mechanic the following questions makes sense or if they just reveal a lack of basic car ownership knowledge:

1. Are there different levels of inspection you can get done?


2. What does a more thorough inspection typically cost, and is it actually worth it if the goal is to make the car last?



And finally, assuming I go for a full inspection:
Is it worth paying extra now for a full service? Could that be an investment that saves money down the road and helps the car live longer — or should I just fix what needs fixing, and accept that the car will die when it dies, whether that’s in 2 months, 2 years, or 2 decades? I mean, even if I do everything right now, I might still end up facing some big expensive surprise a year or two from now anyway — and by that point I’ve possibly spent more on keeping it alive than what I paid for it in the first place.

I get that nobody can tell me exactly what a mechanic in my country would recommend or charge, but right now I’m just looking for input from anyone with general auto-mechanical knowledge and experience.",0,1754003980.0,3,MechanicAdvice,1754076916,2025-07-31 23:19:40,2025-08-01 19:35:16,"LucidMoments (Score: 1): Most of the inspections like I suspect your country has are to make sure that your vehicle is safe for other people when you drive it.

1megduk,2019 Ford Fiesta SE with 1.6L Engine (USA) left me stranded. Serpentine/accessory belt snapped in the highway. What's the most important thing to do next?,"So my 6 year old Ford Fiesta finally left me stranded. Now I kind of expected this to happen because I've done nothing but oil, brakes, filters, and tires for 120,000 miles... these are mostly highway miles, but it doesn't mean they don't count. The accessory/serpentine belt snapped on the freeway and I towed my car back home where I replaced it myself via Youtube video.

Now what else should be on my checklist of getting done? I'm getting close to the 150,000 mile interval for the timing belt and giving the engine's size I'm guessing it's an interference engine so I suppose I better get that done.

If fuel injector was failed you’d get a misfire code. 

Compression is important to check no matter what you’re doing and will lead you in the right direction. Lower compression on a specific cylinder compared to others? Squirt a little oil in and test again. If it raises its the rings, if it doesn’t it’s the valves or head gasket.

I’d check head gasket as well with a chemical tester. It can cause idle and misfire/performance issues. 

That would be how I’d start on this if I didn’t have access to a scan tool or working on something without an obd2. A good scan tool with bi-directional controls will allow you to see the fuel trims, vacuum, and everything the engine needs to run you can keep an eye on and spot an issue.

Edit: old Schoolers check fuel injectors by swapping them, or taking them out and testing them. New Schoolies check injectors with a cylinder disable test or by using a multimeter and checking the resistance.

If it doesn't have IAC, then the throttle body control motor might be weak or binding due to dirt.

You should do the throttle relearn process with somebody observing the butterfly valve while you press and release the gas pedal.  It should open and close all the way with a smooth motion.  If it's jerky or doesn't open fully, then you probably have a weak or binding throttle body control motor."

1meg1ai,Resources for learning about cars?,"Hi! I'm younger and I know very little about cars and car maintenance besides some basics (how to check oil, change a flat, etc). My car is older (2007 Toyota Camry) and has had some issues recently and it has motivated me to learn more. When I open the hood and look down, I get the same feeling that you get when you realize you've studied all the wrong material for a test and you know absolutely nothing.

I'm wondering how I should start learning beyond watching Youtube videos from people who may or may not be giving good advice. Are there any learning resources that you would recommend? Also, along with that, what things should I definitely not mess with myself, even with good resources? 

For context of what I am currently trying to learn about/troubleshoot: I just had my transmission replaced and it drives much, much better overall, but it sometimes hesitates slightly before accelerating. It doesn't really feel like the transmission is slipping again, I think (hope) that is truly fixed, it more feels like the engine isn't responding right away. I want to try to check what I can before I take it in again and potentially spend money on things I could have done myself. I was thinking the spark plugs and/or the air filter could potentially be the culprit if it is something less catastrophic. I've never had them replaced and I've had my car for a few years.

1mef5iw,Car pulling right harder after alignment?,"Just need some advice as to what is going wrong with the car. I have a 2004 Toyota Corolla LE that has numerous amounts of issues. Its expected given that it's salvaged, but my family has had it for about 10 years now. I inherited the car and don't know anything about cars.

For months, the car has always pulled slightly to the right when making a curve as I pressed the brakes lightly. Or when I made a full left turn, the car would suddenly jerk to the right as I straightened the car in the lane. Last month, I tried to get an alignment for it and the picture with a lot of red made me realize it was a bigger issue than I thought. I was told I would have to replace the control arms and the shims, but the mechanic also told me that I'd be better off buying a more newer car as I'll be pouring more than what the car is worth.

I don't have that kind of money so saving this car is my only option. Enough to at least buy some time to save up so I can actually invest in a newer car. So i got the suspension shocks replaced and there was a bolt that was loose on one control arm so I tightened it up. Front brakes were replaced last year, rear brakes replaced in February this year, and i got all 4 ties replaced in December last year too. After a month of driving from getting the shocks replaced and bolt tightened, the car was pulling a little slightly harder to the right than before.

I figured that maybe replacing the shims wasn't necessary to just get the alignment, so I went back and hoped for the best. The mechanic checked again and said that tightening the bolt helped a lot, which is what can be seen in the picture with less red (Before alignment). Shims were now unecessary to replace and they did the alignment (Current alignment). Now, every time I slightly curve left or right and then straighten the car, or make a full turn left or right and straighten, the car will now jerk much harder to the right and I am just so confused at what went wrong now and scared of driving it.

There's this rattling noise that shows up when I brake, but it's completely random - like my car decided to become mysterious for no reason.  
The thing is, it only happens maybe 30% of the time I brake, usually when I'm coming down from highway speeds. No grinding sounds or anything dramatic, just this annoying rattle that sounds like something's loose up front. Could be anywhere though since car noises are basically impossible to pinpoint.  
What's driving me nuts is how inconsistent it is. I'll brake at a stoplight and everything's perfectly silent. Then later I'm slowing down in traffic and suddenly my engine bay sounds like someone's shaking a can of coins.

Luckily I actually have some money set aside right now from Stake winnings, so I can finally get this sorted instead of just hoping it goes away on its own.

Any tips to get this thing off? Thoughts on how I should proceed? 


Do I…
1) try this again on my days off in my parking lot with the tools I already have? 
OR
2) spend $40/hr at the DIY garage that has a lift and tools and possibly some human beings to give pointers? (I’m attending YouTube University so part of my hesitation is how many $40 hours I’m going to need 😅) 
OR
3) let the ball joint nut win, realize I’m not as capable as I thought and just pay someone to do it?

I recently replaced the turbo wastegate actuator on my car(2015 sonata turbo ) because the old one stopped working — no boost, terrible acceleration, and the voltage was stuck. After installing the new actuator, I can command it to move using the Car Scanner app, and it does move, but the voltage barely changes — it just sits around 4.57V and only nudges to 4.58V max.

I also tried adjusting the rod, thinking it might help, but still no change in voltage. At this point, I’m not sure if it’s a calibration issue or something else.

A few questions:
	•	Do I need to calibrate the new actuator after install? If yes, can I do it with the Car Scanner app or do I need something more advanced?
	•	Is there a specific way the rod needs to be set before calibration?
	•	Would disconnecting the battery reset anything or help trigger a recalibration?
	•	Is that tiny voltage swing normal or does it mean something’s still off?

Would really appreciate any advice from someone who’s gone through this. Just trying to get the boost back without taking it to the dealership 😅

1me8zdf,"[Toyota Maintenance] Almost 24 hours, still no update from dealership after I dropped off my car for repair — is this normal?","Hi everyone,  
I dropped off my Toyota at a local dealership yesterday morning for some service after a technician inspection. They recommended the following work:

1. **Replace both front lower ball joints** – they said they're leaking and worn ($1350)
2. **Throttle body service** – $114
3. **Wheel alignment** – $149

I agreed to the repairs and left the car with them. Later that day, I was told one of the new ball joints they planned to install wasn’t usable and had to be **reordered**, so the work wouldn’t be finished until today.

But now it’s been **almost 24 hours**, and I still haven’t received any update — no info about the new part, whether it arrived, or if they’ve even started the repair. I’m starting to feel anxious and a bit left in the dark. I really need the car back soon for my daily use, and I had no idea it might drag on like this.

# ❓Here are my questions:

* Is this kind of delay normal at Toyota dealerships?
* Should I **call them again** or just keep waiting?
* Are those prices **reasonable** for these services? (Ball joints especially seem high.)
* Do people **negotiate** prices at dealers, especially when delays happen due to them?
* Is it worth asking for a discount, since I’m now delayed because of the part issue?

Had my personal mechanic look it over and he confirmed motor mount and saw nothing else wrong, said it was a good buy. Bought it, eventually they fixed the motor mount but it never fixed the issue. I stopped dealing with them for reasons and took it to my guy and he referred me to a transmission shop at that point bc he didnt know and felt it could be trans. Transmission shop checked it out, says transmission is in fine shape, its just the transmission mount now. Took it back to my guy, he replaced ALL engine mounts and trans mount, but that still didnt fix the issue. Time goes on, the buck now becomes a hard shudder everytime it shifts up on acceleration and now I have check engine light and VTM-4 light. No other symptoms. I take it back to the trans shop, tell them i really think its the trans. They say oh its just the 3rd clutch pressure switch, easy fix. Pay them to fix it. Then they call and say that didnt fix the issue, my trans needs replacing. Now my warranty has obviously run out after all this time of swearing shit was fine.

I'm seeing a GM condenser online for $182.  Aftermarket options are ~$100 less.  Not out of line for a condenser at all.

Your car uses a refrigerant known as R-1234yf and it is more expensive than the previous refrigerant known as R-134a.  Not sure the exact amount that your car requires but assuming it needs a pound or two of refrigerant that would be $50-100.

I am aware of leak at the right camshaft actuator solenoid.  It has been there a long time.

__Things I’ve tried so far:__

In all these tests, I’ve experimented with starting as normal as well as pumping the gas pedal while turning the ignition, and applying full pressure on the gas pedal. I’ve noticed no difference in the results. 
1. I attempted to jump the vehicle with a second vehicle.
2. As I did more testing, I realized the battery was running out of power, so I put my battery on a trickle charger and got it up to full power for all future testing. 
3. I pulled out a couple of fuel injectors to make sure oil had not been pushed out onto the spark plugs. Both 1 & 2 looked fine. Not drenched in oil.
4. I added about 5 gallons of gas, so there is now about a 1/4 tank.  
5. I added about a quart of oil through the oil cap. 
6. I checked the tightness of all plastic caps that go on these testers. 
7.  I completed a fuel pressure test on both sides, all good there.
8. I stepped away for 24 hours and went looking for disconnections and loose hoses. none found.

2017 Honda HR-V Evaluation

Asking Price$12,000. Average Retail$10,040. Max Logical Offer$7,600

This 2017 Honda HR-V is being offered at $12,000 with 135,000 miles. While the predicted price is higher, the high mileage and known issues for this model, especially with the engine and windows, make the asking price too high. You're looking at potential repair costs and a vehicle that's already seen a lot of road.

* High mileage for the asking price.
* Known engine and window issues for this model year.
* Asking price is above the adjusted retail value.

# How to Proceed

This 2017 Honda HR-V at $12,000 with 135,000 miles is a tough sell. The average retail value for a private party sale with this mileage is closer to $10,040, and that's before factoring in potential repairs. Your max logical offer is $7,600. That's a big gap, so be prepared for the seller to balk. If you're serious, you need a pre-purchase inspection from a trusted mechanic. Focus on the engine and check all power windows. If they can't prove recent major service, walk away. Don't get emotional; the math isn't there at the asking price. Be ready to walk if they won't meet your offer. This is where people lose money.

\- Engine – Driveability/Startup Issues: The 2017 Honda HR-V has reported engine problems, including sudden unexpected acceleration and issues with vehicle speed control. This could lead to costly repairs down the line.  
\- Windows – Visibility/Failure to Close: Owners have reported issues with power windows, including them stopping functioning after a battery change or not going up automatically. A window regulator replacement can cost between $471 and $810.  
\- Brakes – ABS, Pedal, Rotor Problems: There are reports of ABS problems and the automatic braking system stopping inappropriately."

I'm the designated ""car guy"" for my family, which means I get to keep track of maintenance, fuel, and all the annoying expenses for multiple cars. For a while, I tried using apps for this. I went through a bunch of them, including Drivvo, and I just couldn't stick with any of them. The user interface felt ancient on some, others were weirdly complicated for simple tasks, or they were missing features I thought would be obvious.

So, I did what any sane person would do: I spent my nights and weekends rage-building my own app to fix the problem.

It's called GarTrack, and honestly, it's made my life way easier. And I swear I'm not just saying that because my name is in the code. It’s cleaner, does exactly what I need without the fluff, and handles our mix of petrol and hybrid cars perfectly.

But here’s the thing: making apps isn't my day job. This is purely a side project fueled by frustration and too much coffee. I’m sure I’m blind to a million things it could do better.

So I'm curious:

1. What do you all use to track your car's life? A trusty old notebook in the glovebox? A complex Excel spreadsheet? Is there some golden app out there I completely missed?
2. If you're on iOS and feel like giving some brutally honest feedback to a hobbyist developer, would you be willing to give my app a try and tell me what's wrong with it or what features it desperately needs? An Android version is on the roadmap, but I'm just one guy, so it'll take a bit.

I'm not here to sell anything, just genuinely want to build something that car people find actually useful. Let me know your thoughts!

1mdo6h1,What Brake Rotors & Pads Should I Use for 2021 Range Rover Evoque (Canada / Snow Conditions)?,"
Hi all,
I drive a 2021 Range Rover Evoque R-Dynamic SE P250, and I’m looking to replace all four rotors and pads. I live in Canada (Toronto) where winters can be harsh — lots of snow, slush, and road salt.

I’m looking for something that offers:
	•	Corrosion resistance (due to salt and moisture)
	•	Long pad and rotor life (ideally 4–5 years)
	•	Good performance for daily driving, not racing
	•	Quiet operation with low brake dust

I’ve looked into the following brands:
	•	Bosch QuietCast
	•	Dynamic Friction Company (DFC)
	•	Bremsen
	•	LPR
	•	R1 Concepts
	•	Akebono
	•	Euro / Zimmermann / TRW / etc.

Would love input from anyone in cold-weather climates, especially SUV owners.

1mdqagd,2016 Focus ST smoking on cold start. Goes away when warm.,"Hello! I have a 2016 Ford Focus ST. I bought it a month ago and within a week it started blowing a LOT of smoke on startup. As you run the car and warm it up, all the smoke goes away (after it warms up, something like 5-7 mins idle time) but you can still smell it. It smells like oil. Anyways, I figured it was the turbo (after some investigative digging) and thus replaced the turbo (with a Standard Motor Products replacement), the PCV valve, and the air filter (replaced with OEM Motorcraft filter). This fixed the issue! No more smoke or stink!

For one week. Went to go to work 6 days after getting it going again and turned it on. Ran normal for about 15 seconds, then the engine stumbled a bit. RPMs dropped to about 500, jumped to 1200, then levelled off at the typical 800. It started smoking again after that stumble. 

For reference, I have been babying this car since the new turbo. For one I am new to stickshift so driving gently to get practice but also to break in the turbo. I did everything I could to ensure the turbo would not go bad again. When installing, I prelubed the turbo by adding as much oil to the feed hole as I could, then attached the feed line and cranked until oil was steadily coming out of the drain, then attached the drain. I didn’t get into any boost for at least 50 miles and never hit WOT or anything. Barely any boost. 

I would be concerned that it might be the head gasket or a cracked head or something, but the symptoms completely went away with the new turbo. Absolutely nothing. Also smells mostly of oil. There may be some coolant but the dominant scent is oil. 

What is also weird is the way it started smoking again. I had started it in the driveway and it was just idling. I was doing absolutely nothing. It was just sitting idling, then the RPMs stumbled and it started blowing smoke again. 

I’m wondering what else may cause the smoking or if I missed something else that caused the turbo seals to blow. Also if anyone has experience in blowing turbos, does it lurch like that? Maybe my new PCV valve went bad somehow and it started burning oil suddenly?

1mdq6xm,Smoking on cold start. Foes away when engine warms up.,"Hello! I have a 2016 Ford Focus ST. I bought it a month ago and within a week it started blowing a LOT of smoke on startup. As you run the car and warm it up, all the smoke goes away (after it warms up, something like 5-7 mins idle time) but you can still smell it. It smells like oil. Anyways, I figured it was the turbo (after some investigative digging) and thus replaced the turbo (with a Standard Motor Products replacement), the PCV valve, and the air filter (replaced with OEM Motorcraft filter). This fixed the issue! No more smoke or stink!

For one week. Went to go to work 6 days after getting it going again and turned it on. Ran normal for about 15 seconds, then the engine stumbled a bit. RPMs dropped to about 500, jumped to 1200, then levelled off at the typical 800. It started smoking again after that stumble. 

For reference, I have been babying this car since the new turbo. For one I am new to stickshift so driving gently to get practice but also to break in the turbo. I did everything I could to ensure the turbo would not go bad again. When installing, I prelubed the turbo by adding as much oil to the feed hole as I could, then attached the feed line and cranked until oil was steadily coming out of the drain, then attached the drain. I didn’t get into any boost for at least 50 miles and never hit WOT or anything. Barely any boost. 

I would be concerned that it might be the head gasket or a cracked head or something, but the symptoms completely went away with the new turbo. Absolutely nothing. Also smells mostly of oil. There may be some coolant but the dominant scent is oil. 

What is also weird is the way it started smoking again. I had started it in the driveway and it was just idling. I was doing absolutely nothing. It was just sitting idling, then the RPMs stumbled and it started blowing smoke again. 

I’m wondering what else may cause the smoking or if I missed something else that caused the turbo seals to blow. Also if anyone has experience in blowing turbos, does it lurch like that? Maybe my new PCV valve went bad somehow and it started burning oil suddenly?

Thanks in advance. ",0,1753930032.0,11,carproblems,1754076916,2025-07-31 02:47:12,2025-08-01 19:35:16,"Keyboardknight8p (Score: 2): You’re turbo needs to be replaced. Eventually, warm up won’t stop it from smoking.

1mdq0ux,2019 Honda Civic Sudden Brake failure occurred only Once,"I was attempting to lower my speeds/come to a complete stop and stepping on the brakes as usual would not work and then repeatedly still would not do anything, fortunately there was no car in front of me and eventually the brakes started working again after maybe the 6th-8th attempt of continuous stepping, they were fine for the rest of the trip without any further issue.

When the brakes had stopped working momentarily as described at the same time I also noticed ""Brake"" flashing on the dashboard below the digital speedometer (similar to picture below) and also beeps, when the brakes had started working again the beeps and ""Brake"" flashing also went away.

I booked an appointment and drove the car to the dealership today, I know it was risky but I was extremely cautious including taking the back road with next to no traffic and during the entire ride had no issues either.

They did a full brake check and inspection including fluid, brakes, rotors, and cleaning and mentioned everything is fine with the brakes, the drive back I also had no issues.

They specifically focused on the brakes though from what I can see, could this issue have been caused by something else not related to the brakes (since the brake inspection passed)?

Even though the brake inspection passed and I haven't had any issues since that one instance, IMO it would still be a huge risk for me to continue driving the car just praying this doesn't happen again.

Any suggestions or experience related to this would be much appreciated.

I’ve just gone to look and it looks like something is stuck between the tyres forcing the car to slow down. If I pull it back, it goes back again when I drive.

How can I sort this or would I need to go to a garage ?

My car recently had an axle problem that resulted in a transmission fluid leak, so I had to refill it. I know you shouldn't flush or change tranmission fluid outright in high mileage vehicles, but obviously, there was a leak, thus i could not control the fact that I had a transmission fluid change. I don't think absolutely every bit of the old fluid leaked, but enough did. I've put in ~4 quarts of fluid since then, because it leaked A LOT (like, my dad drove across town with the leak). I have no idea what to do, it just revs the engine when I put it in reverse and Google is giving me all sorts of answers. I keep checking the dipstick and I'm pretty sure it's got enough in it now but I don't know. I keep having issues with my car and it's really genuinely frustrating. What's wrong with it and how do I fix it?

Update: I added one more quart of fluid and sat there for a minute and she slowly started backing up, but it still required me to floor it just to move a few inches and I'm probably pissing off my neighbors. Oops.

Update 2: She finally reversed and I took her for a spin around the block. Doesn't seem to have an issue, but I don't know if I trust it to go on the freeway and take me to work yet. The engine does sound a bit quieter. Is this a good sign?

1mdqeg6,"2016 Focus ST smokes on cold start, stops as it warms up","Hello! I have a 2016 Ford Focus ST. I bought it a month ago and within a week it started blowing a LOT of smoke on startup. As you run the car and warm it up, all the smoke goes away (after it warms up, something like 5-7 mins idle time) but you can still smell it. It smells like oil. Anyways, I figured it was the turbo (after some investigative digging) and thus replaced the turbo (with a Standard Motor Products replacement), the PCV valve, and the air filter (replaced with OEM Motorcraft filter). This fixed the issue! No more smoke or stink!

For one week. Went to go to work 6 days after getting it going again and turned it on. Ran normal for about 15 seconds, then the engine stumbled a bit. RPMs dropped to about 500, jumped to 1200, then levelled off at the typical 800. It started smoking again after that stumble. 

For reference, I have been babying this car since the new turbo. For one I am new to stickshift so driving gently to get practice but also to break in the turbo. I did everything I could to ensure the turbo would not go bad again. When installing, I prelubed the turbo by adding as much oil to the feed hole as I could, then attached the feed line and cranked until oil was steadily coming out of the drain, then attached the drain. I didn’t get into any boost for at least 50 miles and never hit WOT or anything. Barely any boost. 

I would be concerned that it might be the head gasket or a cracked head or something, but the symptoms completely went away with the new turbo. Absolutely nothing. Also smells mostly of oil. There may be some coolant but the dominant scent is oil. 

What is also weird is the way it started smoking again. I had started it in the driveway and it was just idling. I was doing absolutely nothing. It was just sitting idling, then the RPMs stumbled and it started blowing smoke again. 

I’m wondering what else may cause the smoking or if I missed something else that caused the turbo seals to blow. Also if anyone has experience in blowing turbos, does it lurch like that? Maybe my new PCV valve went bad somehow and it started burning oil suddenly?

There are a lot of misconceptions about electric motors. And a lot of car guys wondering why we don't use transmissions with E motors.

Manufacturers design their electric motors to avoid needing reduction gears, and put a motor big enough to avoid needing a transmission. If I were to use thr wrong motor, then I would need a reduction gear. But electrical motors can be made to spin up to specific speeds, in a way you just need to design a motor for each wheel diameter and that's it if you want maximum efficiency.

If you will, an electric motor is like using a huge boat engine in direct drive (often 4th gear). Where even at 200rpm it has enough torque to get the car to roll without stalling. So no transmission is needed either in this scenario.

Basically, adding a transmission will help with low speed acceleration and towing, but that's exactly the area where electric motors don't need help.

The limitation of electric cars is the tire's grip. Not the available torque. It's actually a challenge to make an electric car drivable. Even ICE cars have to limit their horsepower in 1st and 2nd gear to avoid wheelspin.

Now, when we speak aout *transmission*, we mean anything between the engine/motor and the wheel. So, electric motors do have an axle and a ball joint before reaching the wheel. In that regard they do have a transmission, it's just that it has a 1:1 ratio.

1mdn7uf,Just got a front alignment now car all of the sudden drifts to the right after,"So I just got a front tire alignment today on my 2013 Dodge Dart GT 2.4L. I tried to get all four but was told that my rears are on a fixed bar so apparently they didn’t have the right tools for this, so they didn’t have the ability at the discount tire to do the rear, so only was able to get a front alignment done.

I originally brought the car in for an alignment because I was told with new tires you should, and since I’ve gotten these new tires, there was quite a bit of road noise / drone noise, especially between 45-65 mph. Also when I am braking at higher speeds I would get just a slight shake to the car, again only since the new tires. Never had any drift before, though, just figured I needed an alignment due the above things.

I was driving on the highway, and let off the steering wheel to use my knee like I always do, but this time, right after letting my hand off the wheel, it just starts pulling hard to the right. I started testing it a little bit and every time when you lit off the steering wheel, it just starts drifting to the right. Pulling my hair out at this point, because I feel like I shouldn’t have even gotten an alignment, it at least was driving better before. Should I go back and have them unalign it back to the exact it was at before? I don’t even care about the road noise at this point, I’d rather have my car drive straight like it did when I brought it in.

Initial CEL codes were for the intake manifold swirl valve actuators. Symptoms included slowly increasing loss of power during driving. Action taken: replaced the intake manifold/sensors.


After repair, these active codes pop up, as well the Service Throttle Control light/limp mode and an Electronic throttle code.  Action taken: Replaced throttle body. Side note: I swapped the MAP sensor out too, no change.

Figuring this was no longer a parts issue and probably wiring/electronic, I started reading wiring diagrams chasing wires and connections and some harnesses were, indeed, loose. (The harness under the driver's seat) But not anymore.

No change occurred. 

I'm deducing the main culprit is now the wiring harness or computer or individual pigtails, but I find that kind of hard to believe to happen all at once.

Symptoms:

-CEL codes above
- Service Throttle Control/Limp
- Full blast rad fan.
-Truck turns over/wont start with the coolant temp sensor pigtail plugged in. It starts right up when the wire is pulled though.

I've scoured the forums, manuals, flow charts, and diagrams, and I am looking for advice from people who've dipped their hands into an EcoDiesel and may have insight.

Based on the corrected values, is the rear left camber a big concern? Because it seems like I need to change the rear control arm to have it corrected? Please let me know if i am correct!

1me4thw,2009 Corolla - Help me diagnose!,"I have a 2009 Corolla (2ZR-FE). Chassis \~359,000 km. I got a blown head gasket in 2021, replaced the engine with a 2016 from a JDM place \~100,000 km ago. The issue was a blow between cylinders - I've found a bunch of threads about the same issue, but it was supposed to be fixed in newer engines.

On a recent 6-hour drive (35C / 95F weather, AC on), I noticed my temp gauge creep toward H and then cool itself down several times. OBD ECT peaks I saw go up to 118 C ish and then back down to 100. I've also had intermittent codes for cylinder 1 misfires (P0301). Codes go away and only caused check engine light once.

I got a shop to replace my thermostat, and I replaced my rad cap. This was less than a week ago. The mechanic told me he noticed a coolant smell on start, and that there were bubbles concerning him in the rad, but he didn't want to do a block or pressure test on the head gasket.

I did a test myself to see if there were bubbles in the rad - I saw a few medium 'burps' in the first few minutes, but no soda-like bubbles. I tried revving the engine and I saw a big level drop, but I feel like this could be normal due to the thermostat opening. Not sure.

What concerns me:

I've done 2 40-minute highway drives since the part replacements, no overheating on the drives but the next morning, the overflow was a bit above the MAX line, and I couldn't see coolant when opening the rad cap. I topped it up.

According to the [BTMA repairability](https://www.bktyres.co.uk/theres-nail-tyre-can-repair/), the ""T"" repairable area is 65% of the tyre width, which equals 107,25mm (4.2 inches) in my case, that is 53,63mm (2.11in) from the center. In my case, the puncture is located 45mm (1.77in) from the centre, therefore it's within 54.55% of the total width, so ""rather"" inside the ""T"" area. Moreover I think that screw created a hole with a diameter not exceeding 6mm. If I’ve interpreted the BTMA guidelines correctly ([here's the pdf](https://www.bktyres.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Minor-repairs-to-car-and-light-van-tyres-10-Mar-15.pdf)), this still qualifies as a repairable puncture.

I also found and attached a diagram called ""Our Tyre Repair Policy"", which states that punctures in the shoulder area are non-repairable and, according to that, the area where my puncture is located appears to fall within the “shoulder”. However, in other diagrams (like the last one I attached), the shoulder is defined as starting at the “cusp”, which on my tyre begins approximately 63–65mm from the center; by that definition, my puncture would be within the tread area and therefore repairable.

So here are my questions: is that puncture in the tread or the shoulder area? Is a safe repair possible? Does the fact that the screw went in at an angle make repair more difficult?

**Problem, symptoms and DIY:**

- This is is a 2008 Altima, the problem was the transmission doesn't engage D or R, the. And if it did the CVT doesn't change ratio. The code is P1777 (STEP MOTOR CIRCUIT). If I disconnect the TCM the car moves but if course doesn't change ratios. 

- I checked the wiring from the TCM to the CVT connector with a multimeter, it's fine. I checked the step motor, seems within spec (15 ohms). I replaced the step motor, it worked for a week then the car wouldn't move again. 

- I bought 3 used TCMs, none worked. Nothing changed. 


**The fix:**

This guy said he did two things:

1. Replace an IC in the TCM
2. ""Fix"" and issue with a connector/wiring in a sensor in ""rear of the CVT"".

Because I have 3 used TCMs, I immediately tried them when I got home. ALL WORKED. Every single TCM now works!

Managed to make as much room as possible but the clutch alignment tool kept hitting the spline in the gearbox so it wasn’t possible to do at all, plus it got dark so gave up totally.

I’ve put most of the gearbox bolts in and the driver side driveshaft in, but the passenger driveshaft won’t go in.

1mdubit,A good case study: Engine knock that wasn't rod bearings. Traced it to cam bearings and a botched machine shop job.,"Sharing a recent repair that might be a helpful diagnostic reminder. We had an LS engine with a heavy knock. The sound and metal dust on the drain plug magnet screamed ""rod bearings.""

We tore it down, but the rod bearings were pristine. The real culprit was copper dust in the oil pan, leading us to completely worn camshaft bearings, a fix that took us 5 full days to complete right before a big trip.

The lesson here was twofold: 

The obvious answer isn't always the right one.

Always double-check machine shop work. The shop we used installed one of the new cam bearings upside down, blocking the oil passage.

1mdsr8j,"Title: Dealer Fixed My Transmission, Ignored Electrical Faults, Now My Car Is Dead Again — What Should I Do?","Hey everyone,

Looking for some advice or insight from anyone with dealership, mechanic, or legal experience.

I have a 2020 Cadillac XT5 (currently around 78k miles). A couple months ago, the car suddenly wouldn’t start after work. Warning lights were flashing and I got multiple messages — service transmission, service steering column, etc. I had it towed to the Cadillac dealership, where they diagnosed a faulty transmission control solenoid and valve body. That repair ended up costing $3,500 (GM paid half).

The car was in their shop for almost 2 weeks. The day I picked it up, within 30 minutes of driving away, I got a left turn signal malfunction warning, something I had never seen before. I turned around and brought the car back immediately.

They told me some of the same “short to ground” and electrical communication codes were still present (even from the original June diagnostic), and suspected a wiring issue. But since it wasn’t directly related to the transmission, I’d have to pay extra for more electrical diagnostics. They told me the car was safe to drive, so I declined further work at the time.

Now, just three weeks later, my car is completely dead again. I ran my own diagnostic and I’m seeing the same U-codes (lost communication with BCM, CAN bus errors, etc.) and short-to-ground faults from earlier — but now the problem has gotten worse, to the point that it won’t even start.

The dealer is standing by their transmission repair and insists the other faults were unrelated. But they acknowledged (in writing) that the electrical codes were present before and after the repair — and still returned the car to me as “safe.” I also told them about the turn signal issue before even leaving the lot, and it seems like they just cleared the codes and hoped for the best.

I’ve already had a rocky back-and-forth with them (including a BBB complaint and escalation to GM), and now they’ve said no further goodwill will be extended. They’ve also taken a pretty defensive tone, saying I should take it somewhere else or pay upfront for any new work.

My questions are:
	•	Could these transmission-related codes (like P07BF, P1886) have been triggered by BCM/CAN issues?
	•	Wouldn’t it have been standard to inspect electrical modules during a major transmission repair?
	•	Is it reasonable that I was sent off with unresolved short-to-ground faults and a turn signal malfunction warning?
	•	And lastly: Do I have any real recourse here, or am I stuck?

You paid for them to fix the transmission issue though, this is something unrelated and different. And so they want to diagnose it and get paid for that and get paid to fix it as a separate issue. 

I agree it sucks but as far as I can tell based on the information you’ve provided it’s two different and unrelated issues.

1mdsl8r,Need help with power seats (need a better electrical system tech than myself),"Ok, so this is going to be a long one...

First of all, I work at for small used car dealer. I am THE only mechanic here. We do a lot of repairs on vehicles from used parts vehicles bought at auction. Yes I know it's not great, but we do sell our vehicles to be affordable and we do let people know if there are any issues with the vehicles before purchase. I make sure people are not sold dirty/ stinky/ broke down/ or flat out bad vehicles. (To the best of my ability. Shit happens sometimes.) If I were not there, the quality of these cars being sold would drastically be diminished. So let's move past that because I am trying to help the customers.

That aside, I am trying to replace the driver seat in a 2018 Ford Fusion SE. The donor car is a 2016 Ford Fusion SE. The issue is, one has vinyl seats and the other has fabric. So I have to replace them all to match. The passenger power seat works 100% and the other seats fit and look great!

Problem: 2016 driver seat has a module, the 2018 does not.

2016 has 2 connectors on the harness from the floor, 2018 has only 1

The seat i took from the 2018 (the one without the module) works fine with only 1 of the connectors hooked up in the 2016...

The seat from the 2016 (with module) won't work in the 2018.

Both power seats were working before swapping them.

How do I get the seat with the module to work in the car that didn't have a seat with a module?

Is there a way to bypass the module?

Why does the other seat without the module work in the car that had the module, but not the other seat in the other car?

How do I make this power seat work?

I know it's asking a lot but I spent a lot of time swapping the seats and detailing this car. It does not belong in a scrap yard. There are only a few things I need to repair besides the seat that would make this a wonderful car for someone who cannot afford to spend their life savings on a

it’s much easier to diagnose a bearing with the wheel on, if your wheel has any grinding noise, unrelated to brakes, or and lateral or side to side looseness, chances are it’s a bearing, 

If you hear a howling noise that gets progressively louder in pitch as you drive, that’s another sign of wheel bearing issues,

1mdr20p,"Mercedes CLA 250, fluctuating engine temperature after long storage (video attached)","Hi everyone,

I’m having an issue with my 2015 Mercedes CLA 250 and would really appreciate some insight. The car has around 152,000 km on it and was regularly serviced every 8,000 km. However, it hasn’t been driven for about a year now due to a job loss. It’s been parked in a temperature controlled garage during this time.

To keep it in shape, I started it at least once every 10 days and let it idle for about 15 minutes. Everything was fine until recently.

The issue:
•	The temperature gauge (right-hand side) is fluctuating rapidly heating up and cooling down frequently
•	This behaviour only starts when I shift into Drive and move just a few meters
•	When idling in Park, the temperature remains stable
•	The radiator fan kicks in when the temp rises
•	I’ve attached short videos showing the issue, please watch the gauge on the right side

Unfortunately, since I lost my job, I’m unable to tow it to a local dealer or mechanic at the moment. I do plan to get it properly checked as soon as I’m financially stable and able to turn my insurance back on.

In the meantime, I’d really appreciate any advice or suggestions. Does this sound like a thermostat issue? A coolant flow problem? Sensor malfunction?

There are a lot of nooks and crannies that fluids get caught on before they reach the ground. 

That being said, check your coolant reservoir regularly if you are worried. The amount of fluid in the reservoir will differ slightly depending on if you are checking it before your first start of the day versus right after you shut the vehicle off after driving it for a bit. That is part of why there are lines for the minimum level and maximum level in the reservoir. You want the fluid level to always be somewhere between those two lines. 

Keep an eye on your cluster. Watch your coolant temperature. If the gauge is normal but you get a light for coolant, get it checked out. If the gauge is not where it usually is for the amount of time you’ve been driving the vehicle, get it checked out.

Drain the coolant. Collect and filter it if you like, assuming you just put new stuff in there. Remove the thermostat (I know, it's annoying). Take the hose off of the radiator on the driver side and flush the engine with a garden hose until you have no more sediment. I'd cap the driver side of the radiator, leave the fill cap open, and put a big drain pan under that part of the car so I could observe the progress.

The radiator will be your weak link if it experiences too much pressure, so I would avoid backflushing it directly without an abundance of caution. Leave all of the other openings open/uncapped if you do that, so the only risk is too much localized pressure where your hose is.

If you want it squeaky clean, put the system back together without a thermostat, fill it again with just plain water, and add some liquid *automatic* dishwasher detergent. It doesn't foam like regular soap. Then run the car for maybe 20 minutes, drain and flush again, reinstall thermostat, then finally fill with your coolant again.

When the brakes had stopped working momentarily as described at the same time I also noticed ""Brake"" flashing on the dashboard below the digital speedometer (similar to picture below) and also beeps, when the brakes had started working again the beeps and ""Brake"" flashing also went away.

I booked an appointment and drove the car to the dealership today, I know it was risky but I was extremely cautious including taking the back road with next to no traffic and during the entire ride had no issues either.

They did a full brake check and inspection including fluid, brakes, rotors, and cleaning and mentioned everything is fine with the brakes, the drive back I also had no issues.

They specifically focused on the brakes though from what I can see, could this issue have been caused by something else not related to the brakes (since the brake inspection passed)?

Even though the brake inspection passed and I haven't had any issues since that one instance, IMO it would still be a huge risk for me to continue driving the car just praying this doesn't happen again.

Two days ago, I was driving and noticed the temp gauge was slightly higher than normal, and spiked very briefly. Today, I filled the reservoir with coolant and turned the car on. Car wasn’t overheating, and the reservoir stayed the same. Hours later I noticed a small puddle directly under the reservoir and inspected the tank for cracks but it didn’t seem like the issue. I refilled the reservoir and started the car again and allowed it to run longer. This time, the top radiator hose was significantly cooler than the lower hose, the coolant tank appeared to boil/bubble and went very low. The heater also took FOREVER to kick on inside (normal temp to even get warm). I have a container currently under the reservoir to determine whether it is water or coolant, but otherwise I am stumped. From what I’ve seen online, it’s most likely my thermostat or water pump, hoping it’s the thermostat but I’m not sure. Furthermore, if this bears any relevance to the issue, my fuel economy has been drastically worse in the last month. Ive read that this could be due to improper circulation causing too rich of a mixture. Please help in any way you can- I’m aware I most likely messed up the coolant job.

Two months later the car started having occasional long cranks at random times (up to maybe dive seconds). The same mechanic recommended going to the dealership, saying that it may be a programming issue.

The dealer said it was the fuel pump, and that they were getting zero pressure. This was strange since the car was driven to and from that dealership.

The car was brought back to the original mechanic who then replaced the fuel pressure regulator.

The car worked great for two days and then the problem reappeared. Over the next week, the problem became isolated to only occurring after the car had been sitting for a bit, at least an hour or more. The mechanic suggested that it is likely the fuel injectors.

I then replaced the fuel injectors, spark plugs, coolant temperature sensor, and PVC valve on my own. The car worked great for two days, and the problem reappeared.

We took the car to a different mechanic who said the spark plugs and battery need to be replaced.

I replaced the battery which fixed the problem for a couple days but now it has reappeared again.

I can understand losing faith in a car but (without knowing more specific information) there’s no reason to assume that a car is going to die in the next few years based on needing routine consumables, air con and tyre pressure sensors.

* Insurance: • 56% pay monthly (avg £95) • 44% pay yearly (avg £889)  
* Fuel: average refill cost around **£47**  
* Service: • Economy cars: **£175** median • Mid-tier cars: **£251** median

* Fuel efficiency: • Petrol cars averaged **42 MPG** • Diesel cars averaged **48 MPG**

You could always use the 4k as a deposit on car finance for a car that’s 14k and pay that off?

Given the mileage, you need to consider whether it's had the wet belt changed yet or not. If not, I would get it done ASAP. These engines are ticking time bombs for a number of reasons but the main reason is the wet timing belt. Ford, and other manufacturers it must be said, thought they'd get clever with tried and tested technology and it backfired massively.

There are other issues with the engine, namely that they are prone to overheating which causes coolant leaks and the turbocharger is prone to failure. They're incredibly tiny little engines, smaller than all the other little turbos of their kind, which means they get super damn hot and thats not generally a good recipe.

*If* it's had the timing belt done (it's a very expensive job because of the labour) then it's probably got some life left in it, especially as you're doing such small mileage in it. However I'd be tempted to flip it out for something else while its working and has value. Mazda 6 petrol maybe.

- 1000mi a month (800mi motorway, 200mi city)
- country roads on quiet Sunday mornings
- longer road trips (maybe to the continent) maybe once every 2 months, where my car is full of backpacks and mates. 5 adults plus luggage
- moving flat (180cm desk, boxes, etc). I also help mates move, so it'd get used for this a few times a year

So that's how I'll use the car. Here's what I'm looking for:

- quiet, comfortable and efficient on the motorway, with a good sound system
- manual gearbox. Probably 6spd for low revs on the motorway
- lots of space, but maneouvrable and parkable in the city (sensors/camera appreciated)
- good looks. Subjective, sure, but some cars are just fugly
- reliable. Needs to be happy munching miles as well as being driven a bit harder on the weekends. Ideally no more than about a grand a year keeping it roadworthy
- ""special"": cars I see 50 times a day do nothing for me. I don't want to be in the same grey Audi/Merc/BMW you see 10 of on every street. I tend to pour a lot of love into whatever car I drive so I'd like for it to be something a bit different

To make a long post even longer, here's the cars I've considered so far, ordered from my top pick down:

- Volvo V60 (1st gen, 2nd is out of budget)
  - looks pretty nice (R-design) and has a good interior and speakers
  - D4 is pretty quick and should get 60+mpg on the motorway
- Civic 1.6d estate
  - only the newer models are ULEZ compliant and they're really hard to find (only one on autotrader currently)
  - should be very reliable but it's huge so it might be a pain to park around town
- Octavia vRS diesel estate (not just for the meme)
  - economical and reasonably reliable
  - not as ""special"" as the Volvo, even in vRS guise... also a bit of a Redditor car (non-vRS is a taxi car though so I'll take that)
- Lexus IS300h
  - economical in town and on the motorway. Snazzy interior. Petrol too, so a decade from now fuel should still be easy to find and not taxed to hell
  - famous Lexus reliability, though it's nowhere near as practical as other options on the list. An estate version would be my top choice if it existed
- Audi A7
  - bit out-there but it's beautiful, uncommon and the 3.0 TDI non-biturbo gets 50+mpg on the motorway
  - probably more expensive to run and less reliable than others on this list. Not sure how practical the load space is despite its huge size, due to the interior shape and roof slope
- Passat estate
  - should be reliable and economical
  - they look very forgettable besides the newer generations (which are out of budget) and I don't know if they're any fun to drive

If you've read this far, thanks for doing so. I'm leaning towards a diesel estate for my use case but as you can see I'm open to other suggestions.
