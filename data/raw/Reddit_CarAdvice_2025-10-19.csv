1oab5py,How to replace the Alternator belt for my 2010 Hyundai Elantra,"Hi, last time when I posted here, folks told me my car misses the Alternator belt. But could I replace the Alternator belt myself? If so, what kind of tools do I need? The problem is my car will overheat if I drive it and I don't live close to any mechanic shop.

That's normal. The driver side will be currently resting at the peak of one of the cam lobes, which is why it doesn't move.

You can also see on the intake there that only one valve appears to be moving -- that's the ""variable valve lift"" system in action"

1oa4zeb,I’m begging for help. Currently on a diagonal US roadtrip and my camaro has an engine problem.,"2015 Camaro LT - 110k miles

I’m such a moron for this. Maybe roadtripping with a sports car that far was already a bad idea, but I noticed occasional misfiring about a week before I left. Come about a quarter into the drive it started happening again and more frequently. Why I didn’t think to take it to the mechanic immediately is beyond me, especially since the check engine light came on. Come a bit past halfway and the issues (listed below) became increasingly worse in the middle of cruising the freeway. Finally I got the idea to find a mechanic. 

Mechanic diagnosis: He gave me an oil change (oil was black?) but still like 30% full. He also replaced one of the cylinders as his assessment was the right bank was compromised. After he did this, he took it for a ride and called me with the bad news that things barely changed. He ain’t kidding. He said it’s likely an internal issue with the engine on the right side. He seemed like he knew what he was talking about, but he also told me he doesn’t know the internal makeup of engines like others so this was the best he could do. He said he had seen it with many chevys in the past and before he operated on my car he warned me it was a 50/50 chance. This paired with it happening in a random city and the prognosis was so negative I need to hold onto hope…

Here’s what’s been going on with my car: 

Initial issues: 

- once when turning on ignition, it made a popping noise for about five seconds

- when turning off ignition, it would rumble twice before shutting off. 

- car vibrating and occasionally turning off at idle or during deceleration

- misfires on certain accelerations. It’s like a feel thing, the car would freaking shut off going from zero to accelerating if I don’t tap the pedal just right

- needing a ridiculous amount of RPMs when going uphill. Feels like my foot is hitting the floor with the pedal


Current:

- same shit as above but add in the pedal feels heavy like it does uphill, but basically any acceleration now requires more rpm


Thanks in advance for any thoughts or previous experiences that are relatable!

Without enough information, just going off what you've said, I would take the path of least resistance method. (Also, oil is not meant to be a consumptive fluid. There is no 30% full. You're either low on oil, have the right amount of oil, or added too much oil. The same oil cycles through the system ad nauseam, unless you have a leak.) First off, before making a major road trip like this, it would have been smart to have had a mechanic look over the vehicle and have your fluids, spark plugs, etc. changed. But, hindsight is 20/20, now you know. If the vehicle is currently misfiring, you may want to change the sparkplugs and sparkplug wires, and the air filter, to ensure you're getting clean spark and plenty of air. Also perhaps spray the Mass Airflow Sensor filament with a can of mass airflow sensor cleaner, they sell spray cans of it at Walmart and pretty much any autoparts store. A dirty MAF sensor can throw off the air/fuel ratio, as the data it sends to the computer is all wrong and the fuel mix gets all out of whack, can present with those symptoms. I think that's where I'd start, should all be pretty inexpensive and also doable yourself if money is an issue and you're stuck out of town. There are plenty of videos on YouTube showing how to do all of that, just search, for example, '2015 Camaro LT How To Replace Sparkplugs' and plenty of results should pop up. Hope this helps.

**TLDR**: noticed very stuttering when going uphill, different sounds and rougher idling.  Had orange blinking then orange permanent engine light.  Entered into possible limp mode once, engine oil down to 1.5L with no warning lights.  OBD initially showed sparkplug issues -> had all sparkplugs replaced.  Then OBD showed P0014-71 VVT Camshaft position - timing over-advanced.  Official workshop replaced solenoid sensors -> issues persist.  Was then told VVT issues and to do full engine rebuild for \~USD50,000.  Last service was 2024 Dec, had some white smoke from exhaust on startup but was assured by official workshop the car was fine.  For reference annual service here at official workshop is \~USD2,000, also cars here are taxed at almost 100%

**Looking for similar stories and what ended up being done and/or if anyone has any ideas on how best to proceed.  Thanks in advance!**

**Full summary**:

In early September 2025: 

\- noticed very slight stuttering when going uphill.  Same day car sounded a bit different with rougher idling

\- flashing orange engine light came on, code showed sparkplug issue, had all spark plugs replaced

\- car still sounded slightly off (louder/rougher), permanent (non-blinking) orange engine light came on again and entered limp mode (?) - car revs up but cannot go past \~30kmh = 20mph.  Restarted car, no longer in limp mode (?) and drove to a nearby mechanic.  Apparently only had around 1.5L of engine oil remaining, but lights never came on

\- new code showed P0014-71, as per quick google = cam shaft sensor issue/ ""B"" Camshaft Position - Timing Over-Advanced or System Performance (Bank 1), which points to a problem with the variable valve timing (VVT) system 

\- sent car to official maintenance center, waited 3 weeks and was told solenoid sensors were replaced.  But after more testing issues were not resolved

\- 3 weeks later, was finally told VVT issues and requires an full engine rebuild, requiring new VVT, guide chains, primary timing chain, tensioner chain, drive belts, injector kits, solenoids, etc and quoted at \~USD 50,000

\- For reference annual service here at official workshop is \~USD2,000, also cars here are taxed at almost 100%

Not sure if related: last service was Dec 2024, also at the official local Jaguar Landrover workshop.  At that time had white smoke on engine start for a month or so but was assured the car was fine

1oa0r6l,Significant Rattle when Braking,"I purchased a 2012 Toyota Highlander, used, a little over a year ago. The vehicle was in a more corrosion-prone area, so it does have a few minor problems related to that. It has nearly new rubber wheel covers (sub won’t let me say the proper name). 

In the Maintenance paperwork I was given there were receipts for the front lower control arms being changed twice within about a year. The most recent set was two years ago I think. Seems a bit odd and possibly relevant. 

The car developed a severe rattle when braking. It can be felt in the steering wheel and brake pedal. It gets damped somewhat if the pedal is pressed harder versus softer. It is the worst under medium braking pressure and lessens as the car’s speed decreases. It feels kind of like something is loading and unloading i.e. rotating forward, hitting something, and rebounding repeatedly.

I took both of the front brake calipers off to check them and one of the slide pins on the passenger side was completely seized in the caliper. I had to use an air hammer to extract it. But I got it all greased up and sliding freely and put the brakes back together. It was better for a little bit and then came back. 

The wheel bearings were fairly old so I decided to try changing those and while I was at it, I changed the lower ball joints because they seemed a bit loose. I got an alignment afterward. That also helped for a short time and then the problem came back again. 

I’m not sure if this is a related or different problem, but under acceleration, I get a similar kind of shimying in the steering wheel between 45 and 60 miles an hour. It is worse the harder I am accelerating and feels like it is coming from the passenger side.

Half shafts look decent. No torn boots or anything. Any ideas on what I should look at next? I have not done the rear brakes yet. ",1,1760806079.0,2,MechanicAdvice,1760902339,2025-10-18 16:47:59,2025-10-19 19:32:19,Possible-Curve-7455 (Score: 1): Possible rotor runout

2015 Mazda CX-5

Replacing RH side transfer case seals (all 3)

New outer seal was superseded and a completely different design than the original, cannot locate a reference to confirm what I believe is somewhat obvious.

Image 1 is “front side” of new seal on left (all black rubber coated) compared with the original on right (uncoated metal)

Image 2 is “back side/rear view” of new seal on left compared with old seal on right. Note the new seal seems to have a notch, I’m assuming that this lines up with the notch in the transfer case (reference image 3)

Image 3 RH side view of TC with outer seal removed.

I’m assuming to line up the notch in the back side of the new seal with the notch in the TC, correct? 

Just a little apprehensive because it seems that this seal would just be a dust cover, since the two notches would be aligned. 

Dunno.. would be great to get some confirmation since the service manual I have shows the original design seal and cannot locate any TSB or other references to confirm correct orientation of the seal.

Thanks for any thoughts

1o9zm7u,Clutch slave cylinder isn't moving - why?,"Hello, looking for help please. 

Car is Fiat 500 2015 Colour Therapy, 1.2L Petrol.

Before this happened the car seemed fine. I had a service and MOT 2 months ago. I was driving towards a junction and went to swap gears. When I came out of one gear I found I could not get the stick to go into the next gear, it was just stuck in neutral. I couldn't get it to go into any gear at all and suddenly the clutch pedal was very loose. 

Now, the clutch pedal is really loose and when pushed it goes straight to the floor without any effort or resistance. 

When the engine is running the car won't go into any gear. When I try reverse it makes a loud grinding sound. For the other gears the stick just won't go in, like the stick is stuck in neutral. When the engine is off, however, I can move the gear stick into any gear. 

When I looked inside I found the clutch oil was empty.

I replaced the clutch oil and tried bleeding the cylinder but the oil just spilled out where the bleeding tube meets the cylinder no matter how hard I held it on. 

The real issue I think .. when the clutch pedal is pressed, the slave cylinder does not move at all. 

I have attached a photo in case that helps. 

Do I need a new slave cylinder or could it be something else?

The nut will become free. It does cost money for the tool. You should probably clean up the threads behind the lock nut so that it can spin. 

The cheaper option (tool wise) is to cut behind the lock nut and then use an inner tie rod tool (auto parts store have them to rent) to remove the inner tie rod as well. 

Inner tie rods often have lock washers so please look up your model and proper install. You’ll also want to get an alignment afterward, even if you count the threads."

Light doesn't get thrown down the road the way its supposed to.  It blinds others, and while it may look great on a garage wall, it isn't putting light down the road like it should.

Also, nobody who jacks their truck up seems to bother with adjusting the lights like they should, another great way to blind others.  Finally, my experience with aftermarket headlights is that they suck.  Doesn't matter what the headlight is designed for bulb-wise.  They don't put the effort into the reflector design that the OEMs have to.  They just make them point forward with no pattern and they end up lighting the road poorly.

So I've worked on many different passenger vehicles and I've noticed that the majority of the time the setup for the brake line to the caliper in the front end is typically the distributor block>hard brake line>soft brake line>caliper.

I recently worked on a toyota tundra and it had the hardline going to a soft line then it connected to a slightly shorter hardline connecting to the caliper.

What's the purpose in that? Why didn't they just keep the soft line all the way to the caliper ?

To the knuckle it needs flexibility but it may not be able to go directly to the caliper, they design the routing with as many safe guards in place, failed sagging chassis components during a turn still cant contact the brake hose. If this is the case have it go to a hard line then into the caliper. A 2003 Toyota Camry has this because the wheel cylinder in a little valley in the knuckle, cant get the hose directly there so it goes to a bracket, a hard brake line s curve then goes down to the connection for the cylinder.

1o9k5t3,Intercooler Cleaning,"I have a 2013 VW Passat TDI that is currently in ""limp mode"" from having a filthy intercooler. I am looking for guidance on cleaning out the intercooler. I scoured the internet looking for any tutorial or guide on how to do it for my car. From what limited information I have found removing the intercooler most likely requires removing the front bumper. I am worried I wouldn’t be able to put my car back together after tearing it apart, so I would rather not. I have seen people who have kept everything connected except for the bottom turbo outlet line and the intake air pressure sensor. They then pump cleaning fluid through the intake air pressure sensor port and use gravity to flush the system out. This seemed attractive at first, until I came across a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1jugcoi/intercooler_cleaning_gone_wrong/) of someone who totaled their car by leaving the engine intake connected, where the vapors of whatever cleaning solution used most likely went into their engine.

**Current Plan**

Disconnect the turbo outlet, remove the air intake sensor, remove all the fasteners mounting the intercooler, disconnect the intercooler from the engine intake, remove any seals (#5 is the only one I can identify in the diagram), cover the engine intake to prevent cleaning vapors from entering, leave the side hoses connected?, shift the intercooler forward into a “service” position, pour cleaning solution through the top, letting it drain out the bottom, repeat a few times, rinse with hot water a few times, use compressed air to completely dry the intercooler, reassemble everything.

**Questions**

1. The recommend cleaning solutions I have found are diesel, brake cleaner, and soapy water. I am leaning towards diesel since it seems less nasty than brake cleaner and more effective that soapy water, but I am worried it will leave behind a film residue that will later evaporate and pass through the intake. Do you recommend any other cleaning solution or alternatively an effective rinsing solution to remove the diesel film?
2. Cleaning solutions and seals don’t play nicely. The only seal I can identify that needs removing is #5 in the diagram. Am I missing any? And do they need replacing?
3. I have a poor understanding of the intercooler anatomy. What are the hoses that connect on the side of the intercooler/ what fluids pass through them? Coolant? Air?
4. Any recommendations or suggestions based on my current plan?",2,1760754357.0,2,CarTalk,1760902339,2025-10-18 02:25:57,2025-10-19 19:32:19,"DropTopGSX (Score: 2): What makes you think the inside of the cooler is that dirty?

honkey-phonk (Score: 21): It doesn’t matter which order you take them off from a battery health perspective. 

The reason it’s recommended that you take the negative off first is because the many different points in the car such as connector housings and box chassis are tied via a bunch of grounding points on the frame back to the negative terminal. The reason for that is two fold—first it has to do with limiting noise on signals wires, second it a hot wire came lose and touched the closest metal thing, it has a direct shorted path back to ground which will blow the fuse rather than make whatever it touches also hot waiting for you to mistakenly touch it while touching something else grounded and shocking yourself (same reason for the third “ground wire” in home wiring).

Now, why you pull the negative first when removing a battery is it stops you from making that “lose wire” connection from the wrench you’re using to unhook the positive to whatever you accidentally hit it on when undoing that terminal.


A “purposeful example” to be clear:

 *If both wires connected to battery and I intentionally connect a wire from positive battery terminal to metal engine block, sparks and shorting. 

*If only positive wire disconnected and  I intentionally connect a wire from positive battery terminal to metal engine block, sparks and shorting. 

*If only negative wire disconnected and  I intentionally connect a wire from positive battery terminal to metal engine block, nothing will happen. This is our idealized state so we remove it first.

EDIT: You put it back on with positive first for the same reasons—if you slip when cranking the positive terminal you won’t create a short touching anything but the other terminal.

I have a 2013 VW Passat TDI that is currently in ""limp mode"" from having a filthy intercooler. I am looking for guidance on cleaning out the intercooler. I scoured the internet looking for any tutorial or guide on how to do it for my car. From what limited information I have found removing the intercooler most likely requires removing the front bumper. I am worried I wouldn’t be able to put my car back together after tearing it apart, so I would rather not. I have seen people who have kept everything connected except for the bottom turbo outlet line and the intake air pressure sensor. They then pump cleaning fluid through the intake air pressure sensor port and use gravity to flush the system out. This seemed attractive at first, until I came across a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1jugcoi/intercooler_cleaning_gone_wrong/) of someone who totaled their car by leaving the engine intake connected, where the vapors of whatever cleaning solution used most likely went into their engine.

**Current Plan**

Disconnect the turbo outlet, remove the air intake sensor, remove all the fasteners mounting the intercooler, disconnect the intercooler from the engine intake, remove any seals (#5 is the only one I can identify in the diagram), cover the engine intake to prevent cleaning vapors from entering, leave the side hoses connected?, shift the intercooler forward into a “service” position, pour cleaning solution through the top, letting it drain out the bottom, repeat a few times, rinse with hot water a few times, use compressed air to completely dry the intercooler, reassemble everything.

**Questions**

1. The recommend cleaning solutions I have found are diesel, brake cleaner, and soapy water. I am leaning towards diesel since it seems less nasty than brake cleaner and more effective that soapy water, but I am worried it will leave behind a film residue that will later evaporate and pass through the intake. Do you recommend any other cleaning solution or alternatively an effective rinsing solution to remove the diesel film?
2. Cleaning solutions and seals don’t play nicely. The only seal I can identify that needs removing is #5 in the diagram. Am I missing any? And do they need replacing?
3. I have a poor understanding of the intercooler anatomy. What are the hoses that connect on the side of the intercooler/ what fluids pass through them? Coolant? Air?
4. Any recommendations or suggestions based on my current plan?",1,1760754096.0,1,autorepair,1760902339,2025-10-18 02:21:36,2025-10-19 19:32:19,1453_ (Score: 1): What fault was set?

I took my tune off and went back to factory. Cleaned Throttle body, re-seated/Inspected Fuel Injectors. When I changed the downstream cat, it had a bunch of broken comblike pieces inside of it so I replaced the cat. Never got to check the pre-cat cause it was getting late and working in a trade doesn’t promise me what time I’m getting off of work. I’ve done the screw driver ear test with the injectors. Checked the data on OBDII and it’s saying the idle is not relearning. STFT stuck at -31.3 cruising and at idle but 0.0 when letting go of gas coasting. I get a strong unburnt fuel smell coming from the car when I come to a stop. After many frustrating attempts to get it fixed by myself, I still keep falling short. I really do not want to take it into a mechanic shop ‘cause I do want to learn how to work on my own car and solve this issue so I know what to do if this ever happens again. At idle I can hear some burbles in the exhaust.

Under pressure, with the cap off, any air in the system would be pushed out of the open radiator. Only problem with that, along with any extra air, necessary coolant is also pushed out.

The remedy, let the car cool off, fill the radiator till it comes up to the neck of the filler, put the radiator cap back on, go for a 15 or 20 minutes drive, get the car up to operating temperatures. 

Let the car sit and cool down for a couple of hours. Go out open the radiator cap. If the fluid level is at the top of the radiator close the radiator cap, look at the overflow reservoir. 

There is a marking on the reservoir for cold and hot. Fill the coolant only from the overflow reservoir to the level, hot or cold, based on whether the engine is hot or cold, when you are adding antifreeze. 

People tend to make things much more complicated than they need to be.

So, while driving back home like 10-12 days back, I accidentally drove my car into a pothole. Since then, I’ve noticed some liquid leaking from the bottom of the car.

I still drove about 40 km after the incident yesterday, and the car seems to be working fine — no warning lights, no overheating, no weird sounds. The leaking stops about 4–5 minutes after I turn the car off.

The liquid is clear and odorless, looks just like water. I know it might be condensation from the air conditioning, but the thing is — this never happened before the pothole incident. There was no dripping from underneath before.

I’ve attached:

I’m really worried because I have to leave early tomorrow morning for a 600 km trip, and the local mechanic’s shop was closed when I checked today.

Honestly, being a mechanic today is a pain. Cars evolve crazy fast, and unless you're working in a dealership, other multibrand workshops struggle to keep up, and you find yourself refusing to work on certain cars because you need specific tools that only the dealership has, some basic maintenance on modern cars are just mind-numbing due to crappy they're designed, it will make you wonder how cars like these made it into production.

And being a car mechanic doesn't really pay that well. It's nice for a first job experience, you'll get to learn how to do maintenance on various models, but don't stick around for too long, because once you get to the crappy part, you'll feel like you're at work when working on your cars at home and you'll feel less motivated. I've been there.

So honestly, you can be a mechanic to gain some basic experience and practical skills, that'll be enough to do most maintenance and simple repairs on your own cars (the keyword being ""most"", you might need to seek for guidance for certains things, which is where forums and a service manual come handy), but don't make it a permanent job. Keep that desire to be a mechanic as a hobby. At least that's what work best for me.

Do your own experience, just don't wait to be completely burnt out to quit the job, otherwise your interest for cars and the possibility to be a mechanic as a hobby will fade into something you'll eventually hate because your work as mechanic will completely ruin your experience.

This is based just on my own experience, coming from a petrolhead who's into classics and I've been a mechanic for a year on modern cars which I personally didn't like to work on. I was just there to learn how to do basic maintenance and then I left just in time because this workshop was really getting the better of me..."

Car: Mazda3 2017, 2.0 Petrol, Manual. Mileage 69,000.

Just about given up on this and have been passed around by mechanics as nobody has been able to fix it.

The sound itself: Intermittent, worse when the car is cold. After 40 minutes driving, the sound is much more subtle. It isn't worse over speed bumps or anything but the faster I drive the more I hear the sound, up to about 40mph where the car noise is too loud to hear it.

History: I had a screw go into the same tyre which I hear the sound in (Front drivers side, right, as UK based) recently, and it was plugged which has resolved the deflating issue.

\- Replaced all my brake discs & pads (pads were on the way out but didnt expect discs, but I just wanted this sound gone).

\- Externally checked the tyre and removed any small stones or debris. Tyre surface appears flat with no bulges etc.

I am looking for advice on how to handle a situation with my mechanic, I took my car (2013 seat ibiza cupra) in to have a coolant leak checked out and damage may have been caused, below is the timeline:

    1. Thursday: I took my car to the garage as it for a coolant leak on the morning the cause wasn’t known so we agreed he’d get back to me and let me know the cause and the cost. He rang me back in the afternoon to say that it was the water pump and that he’d do the work the next day
    2. Friday: He contacted me at 2pm on to ask for my locking wheel nut presumably  to get access from another angle whilst replacing it, I rang back at 4:45pm to ask how he was getting on and he said they were having issues getting a hose off and that and ring back tomorrow to check the progress
    3. Saturday: He rang me at 9:05 to say that he’d stayed back and got it done but when he started the car in the morning the timing chain had jumped a tooth and wont start now (he seemed to suggest that it was a wear and tear issue and that it couldve happened anytime), he said he needed to check for damage in the cylinders and might need new tools do it  and that it would be an expensive fix if so 

Questions: 
    1. To me it sounds like he was doing work around the timing chain and then the chain jumped because it wasn’t fitted correctly or had been disturbed ? (how likely is this mechanics ? )
        1. If he refuses to cover the cost, what can I do ? 
        2. If he refuses to fix it what can I do ?  
    2. Who is responsible for paying in this scenario can I reasonably assume this is his  responsibility and liability ?

Anyways I’ve sunk the costs and at this point most of the cooling system has been replaced. The last thing is a leak in my heater core but I don’t feel comfortable replacing that myself and don’t wanna spend another 1000 on that. I figured I could try a stop leak as a final effort before just accepting I won’t have heat and potentially coolant leaking in. Well the stop leak hasn’t even arrived an my car overheated yesterday. The last time I broke down entirely and had to get it towed, the issue then was a bad radiator cap. It’s been 8 months or so since then and my radiator was empty but reservoir tank still full. I also should add the heater core leak is very minor so far. I dont know where the coolant is going but I figure it cheap and bought another new radiator cap. I tested around 5 minute idling at operating temp then drove around the block. It stayed cool (I did make sure radiator was filled to neck prior) but then checked and it seemed no flow from the radiator. Does it take more time for the pressure to build and start circulating it? I can’t really use a stop leak if there isn’t pressure to move it.

Any ideas? Im Thinking of just going to another car but I’d need this one drivable in the interim.

Update: because it was less than $20 I got a new radiator cap. I don’t think it was that. I topped off coolant and did a few tests. Car stayed at regular temp the entire time. I just barely had the radiators cap off to try and bleed any air out and ran the fans full blast and didn’t really hear gurgling or see any additional signs of my heater core leaking. Car stayed at operating temp while idle for 30-40 minutes. I put the cap back on and drove for a few minutes from the block. Same thing

However, my Haynes manual (see pictures) says to move to TDC and then rotate counterclockwise 50 degrees for the 2006 year tundra. I think this is because the 2006 has VVT?

I am leaning towards following the video procedure and use the “T” because there’s no mark for the Haynes manual method.

The knock can be anything from an exhaust leak, which you’d smell, to piston slap which usually goes away after the engine is warm, or worst case a spun bearing or broken/knocking rod that seized the engine when it finally broke loose. The knock got worse before the engine cut off, so not an exhaust leak imo; they usually get quieter as the metal heats up. 

Based on your sound at startup and it getting worse before locking up, I’m guessing you spun a main or rod bearing due to oil starvation. Could be sludge, a blocked oil passage, a bad oil pump, who knows. Allowing it to continue to run causes excessive heat which eventually welds the bearing to the journal. That much friction will cause the engine to seize. 

Try turning it over by hand, not with the key, wheels chocked, transmission in N. It should spin pretty easily with a good push or pull. If it doesn’t move at all, it’s done. Regardless, drain all the oil into a drain pan. Is the oil shiny, like copper or silver flakes? If you have glittery oil, that’s bearing material. Actually, I’d pull the pan as well because you may find unexpected metal chunks and you’ll know immediately that the engine is gone. If so, I’m sorry for your loss."

I have a 2007 Honda Accord. It’s only at about 120,000 miles because I rarely drive it (bought it new, only owner). 

I kept the regular maintenance up for about 10 years at the dealership and then just ended up going to a local mechanic whom I trust and only does the bare minimum (ie won’t replace something unless really needed). 

It may or may not be a coincidence, but I noticed that after he replaced my starter last year, I’ve been getting super bad gas mileage. I’m talking like 200 miles per FULL TANK. 

I had him look the car over and he said he couldn’t find anything wrong and just thought that it was normal. I know it’s not. My wallet knows it’s not. 

I was thinking and hoping the gas cap was the issue and an easy fix for it, but I bought a cheap cap at Autozone and all it did was give me an error on my dashboard/check engine light error for the gas cap.  So I retuned the cap and am still using the old gas cap. 

I noticed, too, that last winter I’d smell gas outside of my car when I’d start it or idle at, let’s say, the ATM drive-thru. So again, is it a simple fix like a faulty gas cap/ bad seal and I just need an official Honda OEM part?

Or is this a more serious and expensive fix? Remember, this has been like this for about a year now. So if it was a different problem, wouldn’t a check engine light come on at this point?

I have to get an oil change soon, and I’m thinking of taking it to a Honda dealership again so I can have them check. But I’m also worried they’re going to tell me something needs to be done that is not required when all it might be is a faulty gas cap seal. My gas cap needs to be turned a lot and never fully stops— you can keep turning and clicking it indefinitely which, again, makes me think it’s the cap. However, I also read that if it’s the gas cap, not that much fuel is lost and a check engine light would have come on by this point.

Ideally you’d mount your indicator to the car itself so when you pull on the hub or spin it, it doesn’t cause a change in reading. It looks like yours is mounted somewhere outside of the car. I’d normally mount it to the brake caliper bridge or knuckle some way. When testing for end play, I like to push is all the way in then give it a soft tap inwards just to seat it all the way, then I pull it. You have to imagine the bearing is offloaded completely right now so it may change the reading. I’d also pull it with both hands at 180° from each other in case there play somewhere else just to make sure that doesn’t factor into the reading. 

When you do a runout test, try to get it as close to the outside as possible since that’s where the most change will be visible. The hub obviously makes that hard but the farther out the better. A big one is to make sure it’s also clean which it looks like yours is. 

If you’re looking for a worn bearing, you can usually feel it when you spin the hub. It feels like it “locks” into place when you turn it  and it’s not smooth at all. If it’s a driven wheel then you can test it a different way.

Curious_Brilliant_94 (Score: 2): It’s sounds like the bearing itself is what’s making that noise, especially since you took the drum off them spun it. The only other time it would make a noise like that is if the hub is touching another part of the drum hardware. Usually if the drum is out of round, you’ll feel it when braking and your hear the shoes shifting front to back because the of the runout. It sounds like one of the rollers in the hearing has gone out and may have a flat spot on it. I’d check the other side and see if you hear that noise. If you don’t and it spins just fine, it’s going to be that side with the noise causing the issue. A way you can test that if you want to put the car back together is to see if the noise gets louder when going around turns. If it gets louder when going around left turns then it’s the left bearing, if it’s louder when turning right, then the right bearing. You’re loading each bearing when turning than that’ll usually give it away. As of right now, I say that bearing in the video is no good."

I noticed the other day a slight difference in sound during turning it over. (my last car was a beater that I had a trained ear for noticing any new sounds, but with that comes a lot of car anxiety).
   I noticed this morning there was like a second longer of a delay in it turning all the way on, and upon leaving work today I noticed a hard start and it turned over, but I turned it back off and tried again, and noticed it was continuing to have a hard start for just a couple of seconds before fully turning. After getting home I wanted to investigate and get a video , I called my brother and I probably shouldn’t have turned it off/on as many times as I did. It’s having that hard start and if I hold the key it eventually catches. But if I start it,let it go (clicking or whatever)a few times, and then shut it off and turn it again right after it only delays for a couple of seconds, instead of the longer 6-7 second chugs till it starts when I keep the key turned.

I figured I would learn to do stuff myself and save money at the same time start collecting tools and still save money compared to having it done at dealership. I already did replace both the rear wheel bearings and I thought it couldn't be that harder with replacing the ball joints right?

So I just replaced my 2018 Subaru Crosstrek ball joints and had no issues with the passenger side. However I was really unlucky with the passenger side, first I sheared the pinch bolt, so had to go out buy a cobalt drill and was able to drill thru 3 sizes and on the third size I broke the drill inside. So I had to go out again, buy a 4lb hammer and a punch set to take out the stuck drill bit. After several hours of drilling I finally manage to get to the right size hole and had to tap the hole with the tap and die set I just bought. I can confirm it works fine after installing the replacement pinch bolt.

Now I started removing the ball joint and had to use one of those separator that uses a bolt. Was able to get it out but then comes the hard part - taking out the rusted ball joint. I already have one of those ball joint remover purchased and used it with an impact wrench. There is however not enough space for the impact wrench with the deep spline socket so I attempted to jack the rotor ( i made sure not to put any part of my body towards the direction of the spring in case it gives out) to give enough space but it slid and the spring unloaded that seems to have affected the alignment? I finally just jacked the cross member further which I should have done earlier and manage to take the old ball joint out. Sanded the knuckle with a Dremel with sanding stone, then put Anti seize before putting the replacement ball joint. Now my issue is I can't seem to align the bolt on the ball joint even if I orient it towards the lower control arms.

Did I permanently damage something when the jack slid? If not, how do I get it in? I was even able to get the bolt in the lip of the lower control arm hole but I just could not get it to go thru.

1o9ikvh,Help! My car’s front struts are crying hydraulic tears,"Okay, so… my front struts are leaking, and apparently that’s kind of problem.

I’m completely new to this whole fixing car stuff thing, but I really want to learn. I have a 2015 F36 BMW. The front struts are leaking, and after a week of YouTube university, Redditing and a minor existential crisis, I’ve decided to go with full strut assemblies, so I don’t accidentally turn myself into a projectile during spring compression.

Here’s where I need your collective wisdom, patience, and probably emotional support:

1. Is this actually doable for a beginner in a driveway with nothing but a socket set, jack stands/rhino ramp???, a flashlight, and sheer willpower?

2. What’s the order of operations here and what tools should I absolutely have before I start and realize I’m missing something necessary?

3. Any tricks or warnings, like don’t touch this nut or you’ll see your life flash before your eyes.

I’m not expecting to become a certified BMW tech overnight clearly, but if I can pull this off without dying or pulling my hair out, I’ll consider it a win.

I love this car, and want to learn how to do everything, and I'm delusionally optimistic. 

Thanks in advance for any wisdom, sarcasm, or memes you can provide.",1,1760749600.0,3,AskMechanics,1760902339,2025-10-18 01:06:40,2025-10-19 19:32:19,"Vuvuian (Score: 1): It is DIY doable. I did it on my car the first time last year actually. I went the whole way with taking springs off, replacing strut bearings/bump stops/top mounts with it too. But that was a Japanese Mazda 323 GT-R from the 90's, not a much more modern German BMW. Does yours have fancy features like electronic adjusting ride height & dampening?

I don't know about your car specifically. Hopefully for you it's just done the relatively simple & typical way 😅 . I presume you might have more other suspension stuff to get out the way first. Upper control arms for example, extra sway bar links, or electronic wiring if applicable.

In addition to tools needed, personally I would suggest an impact wrench (& the needed impact sockets too) as often those sorts of bolts & nuts can be really tight & difficult to remove with just hand tools. A breaker bar would be great to have on hand for the odd stubborn bolt (not just for struts) that the impact wrench doesn't get off. A torque wrench is handy if your fussy about tightening torque specs, but I didn't use it on mine.

Then there's also the tools needed to get the CV driveshaft out of the steering hub knuckle too before getting the strut out. Punch set (my driveshaft ends have a hole for them to go into), hammer.  
  
After it's all done, you've test driven it & confirmed it's working properly, you should also get it a wheel alignment too :) . & if you're about to get it a wheel alignment anyway, you might also want to check over/replace other suspension parts that would need to be moved/removed while doing the struts. Sway bar links, ball joints etc. But I guess I'll leave that as an optional for you to decide on.

When I first noticed the leak, I stopped and had the codes run for the car. I don't have proof of this, but both me and my friend remember seeing a code show up for cam shafts in relation to the oil leak

The best fix for this in my opinion is pretty straightforward and won't be expensive, maybe £100 or so.

Firstly you'll need to be able to get under the car so you'll need a jack/axle stands.

It has to be dry before you do this! If it was summer I'd say wash under car first but as it's cold and damp don't bother but still make sure the car hasn't been rained on for a couple of days. Get the car on axle stands and remove wheels. If you only have 1 pair just do the front of car first and then the rear.

1. Wire brush all areas of corrosion to remove any loose rust or other debris. Wear eye protection.

2. Spray on two coats of rust converter to all affected areas that are rusty

3. Spray on at least two coats of underseal over where you sprayed the converter.

This is going to stop the rust and it's going to protect the car too. It's also going make the car look a million times better because all the rusty metal will be black. 

Just buy whatever rust converter and underseal is cheap and well reviewed on Amazon, it's all the same stuff really. I'd go 4 cans of convertor and 6 cans of underseal. You don't want to run out half way through. The more underseal the better! Every year check and give another coat of underseal. No more advisories!

1oa70h1,Ripped off by halfords,"A friend of mine recently went into halfords to have her car checked before having an MOT done by the same garage (she pays a yearly subscription for this service). They told her the car was totally fine and would pass the MOT, the only thing they noticed was the oil was 30% low.

The MOT was 6 days later and the car failed on: no front side lights, no rear break lights, offside front headlight too high and near side front ball joint excessive play. She was then quoted £13.50 each for front sidelight bulbs, £25.55 each for break light bulbs, £40 for both head lights to be aligned (despite it only being the offside front which was too high), £139.06 for the ball joint and £54.99 for wheel alignment. Please also note that bulb fitting is free as part of her yearly subscription. 

I advised her to bring the car home and not allow them to do the work. We then went to euro car parts and bought all four bulbs for a total of £4.20. We were able to fit the bulbs in literally a few minutes. We also purchased a ball joint from euro car parts that costed £19. The ball joint was then fitted by our local garage for an amazing £20, he also adjusted the offside headlamp but didn’t charge for it. Wheel alignment was carried out at a local tyre place for £28. 

Halfords very clearly tried to take advantage of the fact that she was a female and has little knowledge of the mechanics of a car.

All the work was done on the same afternoon and therefore the car was able to return for its MOT recheck the following morning. Halfords then demanded that she show her invoices for the work that had been carried out elsewhere prior to them doing the recheck (of course she refused), they then rechecked the car, and of course it passed

They also claimed that all 4 bulbs had blown within a 6 day period (which of course is possible, but is highly unlikely)

Go for something like Clarke's temporary garages, they're basically a scaffolding frame with a really heavy duty tarp over all sides, or a very heavy duty gazebo (not one from Argos, unless you want to chase it up the street at 3am during a storm...)

Alternatively you could just leave it, providing the car is watertight and parked level - most corrosion stems from gritted roads (saltwater) on the underside or collecting in pockets when it's parked on an angle and can't drain away - none of those things are an issue if it's parked level and only subjected to rainwater."

Whilst those aren't hideous prices, parts are a fraction of that. If you can find cheaper labour somewhere else you can whittle it down. Alternatively selling to someone who is hands on may be interested if you don't want to sort it prior to sale. A branded cambelt kit is £130-£150, Oil change is £50 or less, fuel filter is £60ish, cabin/intake filter £30ish. Pads are like £50 a pair. I'd be able do all that at a leisurely pace in one sunday. The fuel filter and pads require diag tools so it does whittle down the number of people who could DIY it somewhat.

Anyway.

>Has engine light on dashboard caused by intake manifold position sensor fault - £600

If this is the intake runner/swirl flap fault (can't think of anything else it could be) then yeah that's a bitch. Audi don't sell the sensor separately so it's whole new manifold. But. It's a common failure and likely can repair the one you have. Alternatively a second hand sensor and swap it over. Quite the faff tbh but better than having to buy a new manifold.

I think it depends on how much you're happy to do yourself. It's one of things that can be expensive as it's time consuming. Its pretty easy to do yourself, but it just takes a long time and is tiring and dirty.

If you have surface rust dry ice would help with that. But so will some wire brush attachments for your drill (or angle grinder if you have one and want to be more aggressive. Also some normal handled wire brushed for nooks and crannies. 

When you've got as much off as you can (you need to be thorough) you can also use a rust treatment like u/Duckdivejim suggested.

Personally I like Bilt Hamber deox-c for smaller parts (you just make a bath with the powder in a bucket or whatever and Jennolite gel/thick liquid for use on the car as it stays in place even on the underside. Hydrate 80 leaves a film like barrier, but if any rust is left underneath it can cause bigger issues so I tend to avoid it.

Just wear clothes you don't mind ruining through the whole process. 

Then when you're happy you can cover in paint (you can get ones that are also rust inhibiting). 

Any serious rust will just be delayed by this or dry ice. Then it's just welding really.

Also remember afterwards to clean the underside of your car. Especially if you've been near a salt road. The regularly check drains are clear, seals are good (you can keep them that way with some silicone grease.

1o9pxa5,Fiesta vs Ibiza,"I’ve been looking to get my first car, I’m just quite torn between the two and I don’t really have anyone to get advice from. 

The fiesta model that I’m looking at is the 2021 ecoboost mhev 155ho st line, from what I’ve seen the thing looks quite nippy and fun to drive. The only thing putting me off is the wet belt on the oil pump, the car has around 18k miles on it, so wouldn’t be due for a change soon. I’ve been thinking that as long as it’s serviced regularly with correct oil, it should be fine but I’m not sure if this is wishful thinking? 

The other cars I like are seat ibiza, mainly the fr model. I haven’t seen anything really negative about these but part of me has the feeling that it won’t be as fun to drive?

Both cars I’m looking at are similar in age, similar mileage and roughly the same in insurance.",2,1760774253.0,9,CartalkUK,1760902339,2025-10-18 07:57:33,2025-10-19 19:32:19,"NothingIsReal6 (Score: 3): I’ve had a 2012 ibeza for 5 years, bought it at 35k miles, now at 140k and still drives like perfect.

Oil pump wet belts have been used on various volskwagens for ages without getting a reputation for exploding, so I wouldnt let that put you off the ford!

OrangeSodaMoustache (Score: 2): No experience with an Ibiza but I loved my Fiesta ST-Line, the steering and handling was very good for a non-sporty car, it depends on the spec but it had all the tech you need like sensors and apple car play/android auto, I got about 44mpg in it from mixed driving. As long as it's a newer, low-mileage one, I'd vote for the Fiesta."
1o9pmjg,Help me avoid a DIY rattlecan,"My white Mazda 3 usually gets scraped at least once a year while parked on our tight road. The latest was mostly removed with polish and elbow grease, but there are a couple of deeper grazes that have gone down to the black plastic on the bumper. There's no panel damage.

It's a 17 plate so not a new car, but it's been good, and I'm not planning to change it at the moment, so I'm trying to keep it tidy.

Be good to hear of my options here, and if was going to spend a few quid, who should I be asking to quote? I have a body shop I use, but they will want to do a proper job with associated prices no doubt.

So, I want an inexpensive solution that improves the cosmetic look without being 100% perfect, and stops me looking at it every time I get in the car!

1o9phbs,How Dumb Is Buying a Car Without Viewing It? Has Anyone Done It?,"Audi A5, 71 plate, 20k miles, 1 previous owner, comes with 1 year warranty obviously. It has the exact spec I want, only one in the UK.

The problem is, it's 222 miles away. The dealer (main Audi dealership) offers home delivery, money is in the bank ready to buy.

Would I be dumb to proceed without physically viewing it?

If only viewing remotely, maybe I can get them to do an extended walk round with WhatsApp or something??

Any advice appreciated!",62,1760772547.0,184,CartalkUK,1760902339,2025-10-18 07:29:07,2025-10-19 19:32:19,"roryg2025 (Score: 146): Not an expert but I think since they're delivering it, distance selling regulations apply and you can reject the car for any reason within 14 days of purchase.

If you've asked all the right questions, got a good video walkthrough, it's warranted, the dealer has a good reputation and you can reject, if needed, then I personally don't think it's dumb.

axelzr (Score: 19): I bought a car from one of the car supermarkets (car shop who are now owned by someone else), had to pay a non refundable £100 for it to be brought down; though I did thoroughly inspect and test drive it. It was still under warranty as well. Fortunately was good condition. But I didn’t buy until was seen.

voxo_boxo (Score: 13): Your scenario isn't dumb particularly. Obviously it's always best if you can view it first, but 20k miles is low and it comes with a year's dealership warranty. It's probably a safe bet.

I suppose you could pay for a history check on the car if you know the plate, just to check it's not a CatN or something, although I'm sure a registered dealer would have to disclose this.

Plus, it's a dealer sale, so you can probably reject it within a couple of weeks if it's a lemon.

Regarding the walk-around you mentioned, big dealers will do this for premium cars if you ask them."

1o9ork7,Help - reliable used car (mostly for work) for around £10-15k,"Hi, I’m looking at changing my Dacia jogger (2023) that I’ve only had for around 6 months, but broke down on me this week with the alternator breaking and then I was also told the gear box had a leak, so I’ve lost all trust in the car. My family and I have also injured ourselves on the car several times, and it really isn’t very good to drive (sounds like a bag of spanner’s).

So I’m looking to change it. I’m leaning towards a Honda CRV or even a Toyota RAV4, as these seem reliable and practical for family and business (need a decent size boot for work bits). Seen some within my £10k-15k budget which are around 2015-17 models at around 30-50k miles.

I’ll probably be doing around 15k miles a year, so need a car that’s fairly economical and can do the miles for another 5 years without (hopefully) too many additional maintenance costs.

But was hoping people could either suggest anything else which they think would be good, doesn’t have to be SUV, but needs to be big enough for family life? And/or advise on which models are best to aim for, for the cars I’ve mentioned?
