1n9kifu,Help with diagnosing SEVERE oil leak!,"Honda crv 2002 155k miles. 
A bit of backstory: the engine has always leaked oil but would hardly be a few drops at times, I’d check it every now and then and and top it off when needed. I got around to replacing the vtc solenoid spool as it was soaked in oil and various forums said that’s a common spot for leaks. This was about 2 years ago.

Fast forward in the past 2 weeks my car now pours oil directly underneath, I didn’t realise until I drove about 8km for work, and after work I checked the dipstick and it was bone dry. At first I thought it was something simple like loose sump plug or filter but the leak seems to be coming from higher up, near the intake side/front of engine, or near the timing chain side

I drained the coolant and pulled off the throttle body and intake manifold and the coolant seems to be milky? Not sure I just need help what could cause so much oil to just pour while the engine is running.

He then said that there shouldn't be anything under the intake manifold so he said for that much oil he thinks i have a hole or crack in my engine block.

I didn't really believe there was a hole in my block and did find from the amayama diagrams that there is a vtc strainer that sits near where the mechanic said he saw oil pooling up around, and a few google searches said they do go bad however i was unsure if that severe of an oil leak could be caused from that.

1n9j45i,"Crank but no start, even after new fuel pump","Vehicle is a 2006 GMC Sierra 1500HD 6.0l V8

Truck was running fine then went to start it a few days ago it would crank strong but not start. 

The battery voltage was good ~12-13volts. And it passed a load test no problem. Hooked up a spark plug test light to a couple different plugs and I've got spark. Air filter was relatively clean and unobstructed.

I removed the air box tube and sprayed in a good amount of starter fluid in(after the MAF sensor, if that makes a difference). Vehicle would then crank and start and run for a couple second before sputtering and stalling out. I repeated this a couple times to make sure it wasn't a fluke.

I checked the fuel pump relay (I could hear it clicking), and I also swapped it with another relay to no avail. The fuse labelled ""Prime"" (which I assume is for when you turn the key on and pump primes up the line?) was also good visually, and had power on both sides of the fuse with my test light. I could also audibly hear the pump running when the key was turned to ON.

I then hooked up a fuel pressure gauge on the fuel rail. When I turned the key to the ON position the gauge would shoot up to about 55psi, but when the pump stopped priming the pressure would drop down to 44-46psi, which is not wildly out of spec for this vehicle (55-65psi), but it was enough to confirm my fuel pump suspicions.

So I figured what the hell. Lifted the bed up and I installed a new cheap pump off of amazon....and that did not fix it. FWIW, with the new pump the fuel pressure would jump to 56-58psi with the ignition turned ON, and then after the priming stopped would only drop to about 50-52.

I hooked up a Noid light to a couple fuel injector connectors, and they did light up when I sprayed in starter fluid and got it to run for a couple seconds.

It wasn't until this point that I thought to hookup a scan tool (a little $40 one) and see if anything came up. The scan tool powered on but could not connect to the car's computer, screen would just say ""linking error"". Tried my buddy's scan tool, same issue. Tried both of them on different vehicles and they worked fine. I have hooked up my scanner to this truck in the past with no issues.

I did a ""drag test"" on the OBD pins with a paper clip...they didn't feel too loose (although this is the only time I've ever done that). I'm planning on taking the connector apart at some point to tighten up the pins, but I doubt that will solve my issue anyway. I then did some probing. 

This connector has 4 pins: pin 2, pin 4, pin5, and pin 16. With the key in the ON position the results were:

Pin 2 was weird. With a test light that had built in voltmeter it showed a steady 3.7v. But with a multimeter the voltage kept changing from .3 to .9 volts and every number in between, never staying still on one number. Don't know what that's all about...

Pin 16 showed a steady reading of 12.3v, with both the test light and multimeter. Which is good.

Pin 4: with my meter set to ohms and and one lead connected to the negative terminal on the battery I got .206 K-ohms.

pin 5: again with my ground lead at the neg batt terminal, I got a reading of 106 (regular) ohms.

The readings on pin 4 & 5 of the OBD connector seem troubling...I know those are ground connections so they should have a resistance close to zero, no?

________


So at this point I'm thinking its gotta be something electrical related: bad computer, sensor, or bad ground.  There are 2 ground wires going to the frame under the driver's side door. I cleaned those up nice and shiny and coated with dielectric grease. No change. There is a wire that comes out of a harness on the rear passenger side of the engine (which I think is the ECU ground?) and connects to the back of the block, which is pretty inaccessible. So I cut that wire where is comes out the of the loom, spliced it to a new wire and bolted it to the front of the engine block.  No change. There are a few other ground connections that I haven't chased down yet.

When I first got this truck a few years ago it did this thing where the engine light would flash at highway speeds, then go off once you slowed down. I read on some forum that a crankshaft relearn procedure would fix this. Had my mechanic do it and the problem did go away. But about a month or 2 ago the problem re-appeared: flashing engine light at hiway speed.

Could a bad crankshaft position sensor be causing this crank but no start condition? AND also cause a scan tool to not connect to the ECU? Even if I put a new sensor in would the truck even start? I know they need a relearn procedure with a high end scan tool...but if you can't connect to the computer via the OBD then how would you even do that...?

Any help would be greatly appreciated as I'm lost in the sauce here.",3,1757111481.0,9,MechanicAdvice,1757187084,2025-09-05 22:31:21,2025-09-06 19:31:24,"gtiguy12 (Score: 2): Replace the fuse for the cigarette lighter.

1n9j2yd,Head Gasket issues,"Hey guys, so recently i’ve been dealing with a blown head gasket.
1997 Miata 1.8l
First time i blew it was when one of my old coolant hoses leaked all my coolant and then my miata overheated completely (the temp gauge was all the way to H). After that it bellowed white smoke and so after some digging it was clearly the head gasket. so i had the head resurfaced and changed the gasket with one tiny mistake of forgetting one of the dowel pins to align the gasket.

Ran fine for a few months but it did fail the coolant pressure test which when i pressure tested the system while the car was running it spit out white smoke again. and then after a very spirited drive i pulled over for some pics and it overheated, this time about 3/4 of the way (halfway between the middle and H mark)

So i redid the head gasket a second time this time with fresh dowel pins, but i did not check the head for straightness (looking back i should’ve but it didn’t overheat too bad) and this has been the best fix yet but lo and behold, when i pressure tested the cooling system it shot a very faint tiny amount of white smoke and the engine stumbled for a few seconds and then stabilized. Then i pressure tested the system with the engine off and it didn’t hold pressure, went from 15psi to 11psi in about 10 minutes. No there are no external leaks all hoses are new and water pump was changed not too long ago. Radiator should be good too.
It still has the issue of when i first start the engine it has a misfire (even with new coil pack new spark plugs and new wires)

He mentioned he hasn't much experience with the turbo/issue. Shared these photos as it looks like there's a crack on the housing maybe changing a £200 core replacement to potentially £1-2k turbo replacement, he said he'd charge half price labour... Car is worth <£2K. 

Any one here encountered a turbo leak on a VW before, is it likely this if it's coming out the exhaust?
 Is there a cheaper/alternative way to fix the crack to keep costs down?

1n9bt62,Car coolant question,"I was driving my recently purchased used car (2019 Hyundai Elantra) this week and got an alarm for high engine temperature. As I arrived home the temperature gauge was reaching the top (red zone - picture 1).  

I turned the car off and looked under the hood. I noticed a lot of green splashes as well as some green puddle at the bottom, under the engine parts (picture 2). I figured it would be either a coolant leak OR a coolant splash from not having enough coolant in the reservoir to start with. 

The next day I added distilled water in what seemed to be an empty coolant reservoir, ran some test in idle and even took the car for a 10 min ride. No alarm, temperature gauge sitting before middle zone. All good. 

After the drive I checked for leaks, bubbles, steam, foam, hissing sound, smoke but no sign of any issue. Again all good. 

2 hours after the drive I checked the coolant reservoir and it looked empty again. 


I just bought coolant but have a couple of questions:
- is the initial cause of the overheating one of the 2 I suspect? Or any other?
- is it normal for the coolant reservoir to seem empty even 2h after the test drive?
- shall I add coolant? If so shall I drain the system before and how?",1,1757094068.0,9,MechanicAdvice,1757187084,2025-09-05 17:41:08,2025-09-06 19:31:24,"Practical-Parsley-11 (Score: 3): Don't try to drive it. Have it towed to a shop. You may get lucky and have no internal engine damage.

1n98j3p,I really hope someone can give me an answer.,"I'm at my wits end here. So we bought a 1987 Ford Taurus in March. It's practically mint. Only 49k miles on it, never seen a winter, only 1 owner. When we bought the car we changed the fuel pump in it and put new spark plugs in it. She ran fine for a couple months. 
Then we had to change the alternator regulator because our battery was overheating so bad that it was boiling and it smelled like eggs. That was in May.
We've had a radiator flush done around the same time and was told we should put a new thermostat in it. The car drove just fine after that. July I drove it out of state. (10 hour drive round trip). No real issues. August came, the car suddenly would die after we would start the car, like it would chug and die at an idle or if we didn't keep the RPM's up. Took the alternator out and replaced it because we had it tested and it did end up dying. Put the new one in, it still wouldn't run right and kept wanting to die at an idle. I cleaned the mass air flow sensor, I cleaned the throttle body, and I replaced the thermostat. I also figured out that there was a crack in the housing unit for the Air filter. Replaced that hoping it would fix it, it did not. Sometimes we could get it started and drive it just fine with zero chugging or dying. Other times it would fight us. We just replaced the second fuel filter on the gas line last night hoping that would be the answer, it ran perfect after we changed it. This morning it ran like shit again.

1n9a8hl,Dealership messed up my car (2017 Fusion Sport),"I brought my car to them to have the rear valve cover, dipstick and rear turbo inlet pipe replaced. And ever since I got the car back, I’ve HAD NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS. After a repair that would’ve been well over $4,500 if it were not for my 3rd-party warranty.

They refuse to take ownership of their problems, tried to put their screw ups off onto my third-party warranty, which was understandably DENIED, and then slapped me with ANOTHER $1,000 bill to replace parts THEY BROKE. I have all the receipts, proof, photos and videos of the car before I handed it to them. Yet they’re still blaming it on ME, when they had the car for over three weeks.

\*So they broke the intercooler charge pipe.  
\*Screwed up my front suspension after doing the oil pan TSB for the 2.7EB.  
\*Killed my battery; it now dies within 5 minutes of the engine off.  
\*The Engine is running noticeably rougher AFTER they touched it. It was perfectly smooth before.

So here’s the full story.

On July 4th, I dropped the car off to get the parts replaced. Video on June 28th showing the engine bay smoking (broken rear valve cover), and a full view of the broken oil dipstick. The intercooler charge pipe is in focus, and NOT broken.

Got the car back on July 29th, handed the keys, pressed the button to start it in their parking lot; boom, instant check engine light. Code P0246. They took 25 minutes to clear it. That’s how I knew they were either stupid or that something was wrong. And unfortunately, I wasn’t aware what was broken, so I had to drive around with the car unknowingly leaking boost and sucking in unfiltered air. (found out later it's the intercooler charge pipe. Video I had before bringing the car to them, confirmed it was NOT broken.)

The car went in again on August 2nd, where they tried to scam my third-party warranty company for their screw up. This is when I was told I had to PAY to fix their problem they weren’t taking ownership of. They did a temp fix, it’s holding, but it’s still unacceptable.

From visual inspection under the hood, I found electrical connector clips not fully pressed in. The coolant bracket on the timing cover unbolted and is just hanging there.

Oh, and they also wanted to replace my sway bar links, for a clicking noise when they are just fine. ($450 btw) The problem was a bolt that wasn’t bolted in all the way for the ride height sensor or something on the passenger lower control arm.

I replaced the passenger side one, and now as seen in that video, there is a bad knocking noise from the driver's side. I already removed the wheel last night, and the sway bar link is tight.

Shop #1 (seemed a little more professional)
It would be $473 for a ATF change. They won't use OEM fluid because they can't get it but they're supposed to use aftermarket with the same specifications. They guy made a comment and seemed confused about why the computer was quoting 4 hours of labor for an ATF change but that's what he had to charge.

It would be $236 to replace Spark Plugs if required, but they will check them first and only charge $37 if they don't need to be replaced. They also said the coil boots should be replaced along the Spark Plugs so they're charging me for both. 

Shop #2 
They didn't give me a itemized quote but told me $280 to get both ATF changed and Spark Plugs replaced. They're not replacing coil boots. They're also using aftermarket ATF fluid. This quote seemed extremely low and it's making me suspicious. 

What do you guys think? The first shop seems to be more professional.

Once it’s gone, submit the Notice of Transfer/Release of Liability the same day so any future tickets aren’t yours.

List it on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, or Copart with clear photos of the crunched nose and deployed bag, price it a few hundred over scrap weight, and let the market decide. Skip towing it to a dismantler unless nobody bites, because part-out buyers usually pay more.

I turned the car off and looked under the hood. I noticed a lot of green splashes as well as some green puddle at the bottom, under the engine parts (picture 2). I figured it would be either a coolant leak OR a coolant splash from not having enough coolant in the reservoir to start with. 

The next day I added distilled water in what seemed to be an empty coolant reservoir, ran some test in idle and even took the car for a 10 min ride. No alarm, temperature gauge sitting before middle zone. All good. 

After the drive I checked for leaks, bubbles, steam, foam, hissing sound, smoke but no sign of any issue. Again all good. 

2 hours after the drive I checked the coolant reservoir and it looked empty again. 


I just bought coolant but have a couple of questions:
- is the initial cause of the overheating one of the 2 I suspect? Or any other?
- is it normal for the coolant reservoir to seem empty even 2h after the test drive?
- shall I add coolant? If so shall I drain the system before and how?",1,1757093996.0,7,CarTalk,1757187084,2025-09-05 17:39:56,2025-09-06 19:31:24,"Tony-cums (Score: 5): 2019 with 78k, everyone. Those cars are such great buys!

I will redo the whole dashboard (where there's the carpet) and I was thinking to put butyl there, but I wonder if it's a smart move as the noise comes mainly from the rattling inside the dashboard which is where the engine is.

My plan was a sandwich of butyl, 2-3mm vinyl, and to re-carpet the top.

As it is the engine that rattles and shakes while switched on (and I know it's normal for a car from 1999) but I can't put butyl directly on the engine cover to stop it from rattling, what's my best plan? Should I put something also inside the engine hood, from the inside, below the dashboard?

Below the carburetor, there is the intake. Below that, there is a super hot exaust. Fuel comes directly to carburetor and the excess goes back to fuel tank. If the hose breaks, or has mini puncture, it starts leaking, and it gets to super hot exaust header.
Boom, flame. It lighta up the front, and travels back along the plastic hose (not inside as it needs oxygen to react with fuel to combust) and lights up plastic reservoar. When that happens, fuel leaks out, mixes up with oxygen and boom, big fire. Not sure if explosion, but definitely a huge ass fire.


If someone punctures the hose bringing in fuel, it will not light on fire until exaust gets super hot, and it will not smell like fuel until car starts running, so its kind of a valid way to light someone on fire.

Recently, my car started acting weird: when starting, the engine sounded like a tractor, took a while to turn over, and only stabilized after giving it a little gas. I took it to the mechanic, and he said the engine and injectors were fine, the issue was the battery.

He replaced the battery, but the new one is also draining on its own, even with the car turned off. The mechanic is testing the alternator, but so far nothing seems wrong.

From what I understand, this looks like a parasitic drain or current leak, maybe from some electronic module but they cant find whats wrong for the life of them and day in day out my car drains uts battery and the engine struggles to start again.

With car locked and all systems asleep (it can take 20–40 min for Mercedes modules to shut down), the draw should be under ~50 mA.  If you are getting 200 mA, 500 mA, or more something is staying awake. If drain is too high, pull fuses one at a time until the current drops. That tells you which circuit/module is draining.

1n9kwgk,What are these code in my car?,"Hey everyone

I recently bought a 2018 Honda Civic 2D from a dealer. I checked the Carfax report before purchase and it showed no accidents, so I went ahead and bought it.

However, just a week later, I’m now seeing two warning lights on the dashboard:  
• Brake system light  
• Airbag light

I asked the dealer about it, but they told me nothing can be done. Now I feel stuck with this car and honestly a little scared because these seem like serious issues.

I bought an Autel scanner and pulled the codes (screenshot attached). Can anyone tell me:

1. Are these serious/safety-related issues?
2. What might it cost to fix them?
3. Any suggestions on what I should do next?

At this point, I’m mostly concerned about safety, not so much about comfort features.

Check local laws too of course.

To diagnose all of that, it will likely cost a lot alone. Possibly something as simple as a bad battery or ground, but it could be issues in the wiring, ecm, bcm etc. a lot of them are absolutely related to safety...air bags and power steering to start.

1n8ryf4,Question about gearbox.,"Hi, thanks in advance to any help anyone can provide.

The car that is the source of the question is a RHD (UK), VW Golf MK7, manual.

Basically, for around 2 months I have had issues with the cars gearbox, I've had it looked at by two people who I trust who have both advised me I simply need a new/good second hand gearbox.

I took it a supposed 'gearbox specialist' who first said it needed a new clutch, which I paid for. They then said it also needed a new gearbox which they would supply and fit free of charge (first red flag). You can probably guess but a month later the car still wasn't fixed and it wasn't until I walked in to the garage and demanded the car that I was able to limp it home.

The car has been in no way fixed since entering the garage and I find it very hard to believe that a new gearbox has been fitted free of charge. Upon collection I asked to see their proof of purchase from their gearbox supplier at which point a very angry mechanic told me he wouldn't show me.

Ultimately I am deeply skeptical that a new gearbox is in my car and wondered if there is any way that I can check this - do gearboxes tend to have unique tags or dates of manufacture stamped on them? Are there any glaring signs that I should be looking out for when I open the bonnet? Bear in mind I have no mechanical expertise so if it requires any tools I'm not going to be of much use!

I was emailed by the insurance company that ""an appraiser will be reviewing things and will follow up once complete"". A little over 2 weeks later I received a voicemail from some company out of Texas and we are now being told that this company specializes in overspray removal.

Some staff member received emails with PDF documents for this company. On the PDF it states ""Owner approval is accomplished on the final inspection with the Detail Masters’ technician. A signed release of liability is obtained once the owner is satisfied. This document also serves as authorization for direct payment."" I don't agree with this as what happens a few weeks or months after when my plastic or paint could be affected but won't show right away?

Has anyone else had this happen? What can I do to protect myself? I'm sure this is saving the insurance company a lot of $$$ as my quote alone was for $12,900.

Anyway you don’t have much choice. The vendors insurance has a cash limit I’m sure and $12k (which is ridiculous btw) x 50 is well over it. So you either file a claim with your own insurance or let the removal people do it. I don’t know what damage you think is going to show up anyway?

PLEASE HELP. I have a 2018 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid. I was having an alignment done after one tire was suddenly almost bald, even though I get regular alignments and rotations as recommended. The reason why? The tie end rod is totally seized up and they told me it needs replacing. 

I’m no stranger to fixing things on my own vehicles, and they told me it’s a fairly easy job. I watched some videos and agree, looks like something I can do in 30 min to an hour. EXCEPT, I can’t get the damn thing off! It’s stuck to the inner rod real good. I took the outer most part off the actual wheel, but the inner part that is screwed onto the inner tie rod won’t budge. We have tried lubricating it (with a couple different things) and heating it up both with a heat gun and a torch. I have also tried different methods of getting leverage, including putting it back on the wheel and just trying to turn the inner rod to loosen it. It’s going nowhere and I’m scared to strip the inner tie rod. 

I can’t afford to pay someone to do it for me right now. I’m curious if anyone has any new suggestions?? Also, I thought maybe I could just replace both the inner and outer rod, but the only way I know to remove the inner rod is with an inner tie rod removal tool, which can’t be used until the outer rod is removed.

With this type of tool, you don,t need to get the outer tie rod off to remove the inner unlike with the tube style tie rod remover.  This thing basically clamps to the inner tie rod on the base/ball joint and you can use a breaker bar then later normal ratchet to get the proper leverage to turn it.

I replaced inner and outer tie rods on both sides of my car recently and this thing was a huge help. Despite being able to get the outer tie rods off easily I could not get the tube style remover to work because every time I turned it, it kept slipping off no matter what size insert I used and tried everything else too.

After about 2 hours I went out there and the fans were not running.  This morning (8 hours later) I went out there the fans could be faintly heard and the truck was dead.  

Any help is greatly appreciated.  

****update******
I replaced the 3 relays as was recommended.  When I came out from work the fan was going.  (It was not running when I got to work).
I ordered the temperature control sensor and will replace it tonight.

But in addition:  when I started for home the truck was running terribly.  Like I was only using 3 cylinders.  After a couple minutes it drove fine.  Like 95%.  I drove on the freeway without incident for about 15 minutes and when I exited and was at a redlight the idle was rough.
This truck has always run beautifully. I changed the plugs a years ago (maybe 25k miles)

Do you guys think this is all related?

Either way I would at least replace the sway bar links (and verify they are the correct size) and replace that control arm.  There's enough material missing that I would worry about it snapping along the narrowest part and that's a really bad time if it happens at highway speed.

1n8uyn1,Advice on Used Engine Compression Test – 2016 Toyota Camry 2.5L,"My dealership is replacing the engine in my 2016 Toyota Camry (2AR-FE, 2.5L, VIN F) after service-related damage. They sourced a used engine and shared the compression results with me. Here are the numbers:

* Cyl 1: \~180 psi (12+ cranks, 1st stroke 65 → 110)
* Cyl 2: \~165 psi (12+ cranks, 1st stroke 65 → 110)
* Cyl 3: \~175 psi (12+ cranks, 1st stroke 60 → 100)
* Cyl 4: \~165 psi (1@+ cranks, 1st stroke 65 → 110)

From what I understand, Toyota’s spec is \~180–210 psi with 160 being the lower limit, so the final numbers seem acceptable. What concerns me is that it took 12–17 cranks to reach peak PSI, much slower than the usual 4–6 strokes. The first stroke readings (60–65 psi) were consistent, but the slow build makes me wonder about worn rings vs. test setup (weak battery, throttle closed, etc.).

The dealer is giving me a 12-month/12k warranty and says they’ll cover labor if there are issues. They also agreed to replace the rear main seal during install.

**My questions:**

1. Do these numbers/patterns look OK for a used \~100k mile engine?

Except normally we don't... Mechanics are not auto body technicians or insurance adjuster, asking here is like asking if your plumber if your electrical outlets can be replaced, it's just a guess. We fix mechanical things related to collisions sometimes, but we don't get into what your asking even a little bit.

Unfortunately this is going to be up to the insurance adjuster... They will determine the FMV of the vehicle prior to collision, and the estimated repair costs... if the repair costs are estimated to exceed 75% of the FMV, then it will be considered a write-off and totaled out, if it is less than 75% the vehicle will be repaired. That ""75%"" does vary some by state anywhere from 60-100 percent, but that is a good general idea.

In this case you are at \~$27k in FMV (depending on mileage, location, condition, etc), so if repairs would exceed $20k, it is likely to be write-off... now $20k in repairs is A LOT of repairs, so at first glance assuming no frame damage and no air bag deployment, it would be repaired... But it seem an airbag was deployed, so it is going to be at the insurance adjusters discretion if the SRS can be properly repaired and placed back into service safely. To some insurance companies, an airbag deployment is an automatic total loss write-off, but not others, and if it was only that one airbag the system ""might"" be able to return to service. 

Yeah, so basically the tl;dr summary is a guess that we don't know. lol"

1n99wws,I really hope someone can give me an answer.,"I'm at my wits end here. So we bought a 1987 Ford Taurus in March. It's practically mint. Only 49k miles on it, never seen a winter, only 1 owner. When we bought the car we changed the fuel pump in it and put new spark plugs in it. She ran fine for a couple months. 
Then we had to change the alternator regulator because our battery was overheating so bad that it was boiling and it smelled like eggs. That was in May.
We've had a radiator flush done around the same time and was told we should put a new thermostat in it. The car drove just fine after that. July I drove it out of state. (10 hour drive round trip). No real issues. August came, the car suddenly would die after we would start the car, like it would chug and die at an idle or if we didn't keep the RPM's up. Took the alternator out and replaced it because we had it tested and it did end up dying. Put the new one in, it still wouldn't run right and kept wanting to die at an idle.

1n99fxo,Advice requested on timing belt wear,"Hello,

My car is equipped with a Puretech engine, which is known for durability issues. The wet belt deteriorates over time ; on top of that, some people experienced fuel leaking in oil, accelerating the belt deterioration. The last one I have not experienced myself as far as I know ; I understand that in that case oil would get burnt too (it would leak in the combustion chamber just in the same way fuel leaks in the oil), but I have not noticed any overconsumption of oil. 

Because of that I was assuming my belt could just be changed at the normal interval given by the manufacturer, which is 160000km (100k miles). Right now, I am at 130000 km with the original belt (80k miles), so given my car use, I was expecting to change within one to two years.

A week ago I went to a mechanic for an unrelated issue (air conditioning). When given the car back, I was told my belt could ""snap any moment"" and that I have to change ASAP, because they saw cracks. No matter how much I look at the belt in different positions (after starting the engine multiple times), I do not see any crack, however the belt is ""textured"" in a checkered pattern. I expected it perfectly smooth, like in pics of belts I saw online. The pattern is regular though.

Moreover the exhorbitant price asked by the mechanic (compared to other mechanics where I asked for a quotation - half price) and the language used makes me think they tried to play on the panic effect, and are possibly dishonest.

I do not know it means a ""layer"" of the belt could have ""peeled off"", or if its the normal texture for some belts ; I put a video in this post (sorry about the limited view, cannot access better without opening everything) ; could anyone please give me an opinion of the status of this belt?

The car looks like it's lived in a garage its whole life. Carfax shows that the owner bought it in 2009 off the showroom floor and did regular maintenance 2-3x a year. It's in excellent condition. Only downside, it needs $1,200 in repairs and the dealership won't budge on the price of $12,000. With that price, after taxes and repairs the total cost would be roughly $14,700. The repairs aren't anything major. The mechanic said (sorry I'm not a mechanic so I'll try to say exactly what he said) the the rear shocks were leaking oil and need replaced as a result. And the front tire arm bushings need to be replaced. 

If the dealership continues to refuse to budge on the price, would it be completely stupid to buy a 2009 for $14.7? Would I be getting screwed over on this deal?

1n939fn,Wheel Nut Snapped - Advice?,"
Hi all.

My car (Renault Megane 2012 1.5 diesel) passed it's MOT on Friday 29th of August with the only advisory being my two front tyres being close to he legal limit. These tyres have not been removed since they did my offside front suspension arm at the very beginning of August (which was the same side as the wheel missing the nut).

I was going to leave it until the end of this month to book in to the garage to get them repaired as I had just spent £400 on suspension and welding to pass it through the MOT (this is relevant, I promise) but my dad very kindly sent me money to get them done so instead of going to my usual garage, I booked a mobile fitter from ATS out to my work for the following Tuesday (2nd September) so not to take any time off of work.

Here comes the day, I go out, give him the locking wheel nut key, and he says to go back inside and he'll call me when he's done. He calls me about 30ish minutes later, I come out, he shows me, hands me a red tag as a notice of defect, and says that he saw it and couldn't drive off without mentioning it. Sounds like a pre-existing issue right?

Wrong. I call up my garage, ask them if they knew I was missing a wheel nut due to the mot, they said that's strange it would not have passed it's MOT if it was missing one, and they checked it briefly for me that afternoon. They said it looked fresh, and one of the mechanics said it's likely the ATS guy broke it.

Now I might have to pay for a new wheel hub as it is snapped, and I cannot be arsed with a he said she said palava where everyone is blaming the other party. I've attached photos of the wheel in question (please forgive the state of my alloys) - can you guys give your input on if this looks fresh or not? First photo taken before driving the car anywhere after changing, the second closer photo being taken after driving home.

We used 3.5 quarts of Pennzoil High Mileage 0W-20 since the car has 130K miles on it. For the filter we used the FRAM Ultra Synthetic XG7317 Filter. I double checked the compatibility on the website. I made sure to tighten the drain plug and filter well. The filter was prelubed as per the instructions of many youtube tutorials. 

We turned on the car and checked the dipstick. The oil was just under the max fill line and as far as I could see, there was no oil leaking under the car. 

Potential Problem: 
The engine makes a ticking/clicking sound. Is it normal? Unfortunately, I cannot say if it was making that sound before the oil change so honestly can’t tell if the engine is supposed to sound like how it does now. We haven’t driven it anywhere in case.

Providing a video for reference.

1n9i370,To EV or not to EV.,"Looking for a bit of input on a car decision I’ve got coming up.

Currently driving a 2016 Mercedes E220 estate (66 plate) with just under 72k miles. It’s the Premium Plus spec, so it’s loaded – pano roof, big dual screens for nav/instrument cluster, heated seats, adaptive LEDs, the lot. Honestly, it’s been a brilliant car. The only issue I’ve ever had is the steering wheel won’t adjust up/down properly, but apart from that, no complaints at all.

That said, it’s nine years old now, and even though it’s running fine, I’ve got the itch to move on.

My dad’s offering to sell me his 2021 BMW 520 (M Sport, Comfort Pack, Tech Pack) with only 25k miles. He’s looking for around £26k, which feels like a good deal. The only thing it’s missing is the 360 cameras I’ve got on the Merc – not a huge deal for me, but my wife likes them. I know a lot of those “COVID cars” ended up short on some spec because of chip shortages, so not unexpected. I figure I could probably get £16–17k for the Merc, so essentially it’s about £10k on top to move into the BMW.

The other option is going EV. I’ve been looking at the Skoda Enyaq 85X Sportline – budget is around £25–30k, and it seems like a really solid option. Good range, plenty of toys, and I like the look of it. Most of our weekly driving is short trips, but we do one or two long drives into Europe every year, so range is a factor.

So I’m stuck between:

1. Stick with the Merc (least exciting, but cheapest).
2. Move into my dad’s BMW – newer, good spec, nice deal.
3. Take the leap into EV with something like the Enyaq.

Would love to hear what people think – is the BMW the sensible move, or is now the time to go EV?",0,1757108923.0,30,CartalkUK,1757187084,2025-09-05 21:48:43,2025-09-06 19:31:24,"BaldyBaldyBouncer (Score: 8): 3 completely different options there mate.

1n9devq,Exiting the Shark-Tank,"My wife and I decided it was time to change the car (2008 Golf sale if anyone's interested ?)  so I steel myself for a long visit to the shark tanks of car dealerships.

Initially we didn't know what we wanted so decided to look at a few smallish SUV's.

1. Dealer 1: Volvo XC40. Based in an central london multi-storey car park.  Lighting poor.  No test drive offered (which wouldn't have been easy given the location). Too many bodywork scratches and a missing towhook cover. Said I wasn't interested as had other cars to look at.
2. Dealer 2: Skoda Karoq. Car supermarket.  Never been to one before.  Huge amount of desks in a massive office.  Loads of sales staff. Picked 3 cars (inc. Skoda). Was able to test drive one around the block.  Barely out of the car park and the sales guy asks if I'm buying. After the test drive was able to look at a few more cars from the outside and sit in.  Salesman was joined by a more senior collegue to put the pressure on. Told them I wouldn't be buying that day as I'd lined up other test drives.
3. Dealer 3: BMW dealer. 330E (OK not SUV but hear me out). Car advertised on Autotrader but when I phoned was told it wasn't ready for test drive and they would phone me back when it was.  Asked for £200 deposit rather than £99 on their website. Didn't pay it.  They never called back.
4. Dealer 4: Sells prestige cars. XC40.  In spite of timed appointment was kept waiting at least 20 minutes.  Short test drive.  No sales pressure but seemed disinterested really.  Knew nothing about the car.
5. Dealer 5: Car supermarket.  XC40. Failed to collect me from railway station as agreed.  Brought the car round for me to take for a test drive.  Already a battery fault on the dash advising it shouldn't be driven. Took it for a drive anyway and there were other issues with it not accelerating. Told them I wouldn't be buying.  Salesman took it for a drive with his manager and came back and said it was fine.  Asked if I would buy if they fixed it.  They'd taken my driving license and I was kept waiting for them to give it back.
6. Dealer 6: Dealership for Suzuki and Kia. XC40. Decent test drive. Agreed to buy (fed up by this stage). Paid a £500 deposit. Car was ex-Motability which meant taxing would have been a bit of a pain.  Salesman claimed it was tax exempt as it was a hybrid.  (It's not).  Changed my mind over the weekend and realised that I could get the same car from a Volvo main dealer with better warranties.  Phoned Dealer 6 up who (much to my surprise and relief) happily refunded my deposit - phew.
7. Dealer 7: Volvo main dealer.  Booked test drive, turned up on time and kept waiting 15 minutes. Test drive was good and as long as I wanted it to be - even offered to go on the motorway.  They'd resprayed the tailgate due to a scratch and it looked immaculate.  They were also refurbing the alloys at no cost.

Agreed to buy and put down a deposit.

They wanted to close the deal before the August month-end but I refused to pay tax for 2 days and emailed to asked for £50 off.  Manager phoned me on Sunday 31st at midday asking when I was collecting and I said no one had responded to my email etc. Agreed to collect on Monday.

When I went to collect on Monday 1st September they then realised that it too was ex-Motability and had to take me to the nearby post office to tax it.  Salesman isn't local and doesn't know the area so takes a while.  Manager apologies and I say just as well I didn't come on Sunday then (no PO's open).

Drive away and within 10 minutes have a tyre pressure warning light.  Find a garage and put air  in tyres and reset the warning.  Warning re-appears and so back to the dealer.  Another 30 minutes wait while they fix it.  Drive away and no re-occurrence (so far).

If you go to a half-decent restaurant, spend £100 or so for two, the front-of-house staff should be able to talk you through the menu, what they're selling. If you go to car dealership and are looking to spend £25k on a car, forget it.  The sales staff know very little of the product they are selling.

As a buyer you are likely going to be more informed than the salesperson, I have a feeling that the salesperson always says that they don't know anything about the car (or genuinely don't know) so that they don't inadvertently say something which is untrue.

Went to a Kia dealership once to buy the wife a specific car I'd seen on their website, with a pocketful of cash. Looked it over in the carpark, asked the saleslady for the keys to look inside because we wanted it and had the means to purchase it there and then. We were shown a lime green sofa in a very shiny showroom and pertly told to wait 5 minutes. We were then roundly ignored for exactly 50 minutes watching the staff milling about, before my patience ran out and we left. Found a little Independant dealer just down the road who couldn't do enough for us, and bought a better car from him instead."

Snug it back up, make sure there's still enough coolant in the expansion tank, start it up again and set the HVAC to full hot and minimum (not off) fan, that circulates coolant into the heater core.

I definitely need my own car as I’m the main carer for both my mum and dad and there’s no public transport options to their houses after 6pm. There are no car clubs or hire schemes where I live. 

I have a couple of options that I’ve been considering but open to more ideas. 

1) buy a “banger” or “banger-esque” car for cash - budget £4k. No monthly payment for car, just a savings pot for maintenance and insurance etc.

2) lease a car through the salary sacrifice scheme at work which includes everything- maintenance, tax insurance etc. I can get a Cupra, VW Golf or Audi A3 PHEV type car for £400 a month (no deposit req) also about a 25 week wait! Not the end of the world just slightly irritating. 

3) buy an older 4x4 type car that has already done most of its depreciation that I can keep until it falls apart. I’ve been considering Lexus RH, VW Tiguan etc. Budget for this would be £17k loan on 5.8% apr that I’d pay up over 3 years then just have a monthly savings pot for maintenance & insurance etc. 

I live in north central Scotland so there’s not a massive number of second hand car options but could go south to collect the right car. I currently spend £280 a month on my car finance. Then usually about a further £500 a year on maintenance. 

All above options are affordable to me but sometimes the car only moves once or twice a week to pop to the supermarket so it seems excessive to pay for a new car sitting there not doing anything? 🤔

You can get a great Passat / Octavia / A4 for your budget & just buy some good all season tyres so you can ride around all winter without issues. 

I’ve been up to Ullapool etc many times in mid winter in my FWD octavia without issues - and seen many 4x4s in hedges.

As a third option - if you never do long journeys - just buy a nissan leaf and plug in at home.

Downside is having to fix cars as an emergency in order to stay mobile. Working on a car in the dark at winter time isn't much fun and can be stressful. Also changing cars in an unplanned way often really limits your choices and again can be stressful.

I probably saved a lot of money over the years, although there's an element of luck to that.

I'm getting old now, I'm less skint, and have my own company so getting myself a company car became a no brainer. Recently I got a pretty nice brand new EV on a lease deal and I'm never going back to bangers.

So yeah, it depends on whether you give a shit what other people think of the car you drive, which was never high on my list of priorities. And anyway, most of the old cars I drove were cool AF, or at least I thought so.

It also depends on your budget, how highly you prioritise your car over other things like hobbies and holidays. It is also modified by your ability to fix things and your risk tolerance.

It's a question only you can answer"

Well as the fluid can essentially absorb water, you run the risk of pumping water around your brake system and potentially causing brake lines & your brake callipers to corrode / rust inside over time. If you can afford it and want to look after your car long term, £80 doesn’t sound bad at all. Hope this helps.

1n95ixr,Warranties and removing seats.,"Having exhausted my search for a new or near-new 7 seater SUV that has the disappointingly lost art of a factory removable or disappearing second row middle seat I'm now considering falling back to a 2024 Volvo XC90 T8 PHEV, circa £50k, which at least has separate 40/20/40 second row seats rather than the annoyingly common 60/40 benches in everything else.

There's various guides online for unbolting the second row middle seat and tricking the onboard computer to not complain with the right resistors plugged into the seat's electrics cable. Seems simple enough job to take it out and put it back in again in 30 mins or so with just a bit of heaving, which would be fine for our use case (daily running as 3 row 6 seater, summer holiday running as 2 row 5 seater with massive boot).

Question is, how would that effect the warranty, obviously specifically in relation to UK law and UK warranties? Volvo's come with 3 year warranties, so a 2024 is going to have 2 years left. Obviously the dealer is going to say don't do it. But will removing a seat and toying with specifically that seat's electrics invalidate the whole warranty? Or parts of it in relation to problems with that seat alone?

Or is it better to just downgrade a bit and get a 2022 model where the warranty would have run out anyway? Issue is the bloody XC90s hold value so well that won't actually save much cash for being out of warranty and further from uptodate feature set.",0,1757079497.0,2,CartalkUK,1757187084,2025-09-05 13:38:17,2025-09-06 19:31:24,DaughterOfATiredMech (Score: 1): Every car I know that does these are older.

1n95i1q,Advice needed on bangernomics,"Wife and I both have nice cars. For reasons not worth going into, I ended up acquiring an old Fiat 500 4 years ago, and have used it as a tip car and train station hack. It’s been used and abused, been loaded with building materials, had stuff strapped to it, been left in the dodgiest of cars parks overnight etc. 

It’s now 16 years old and has 94000 miles. Suspension is knocky and it’s got its fair share of rattles. Amazingly it still looks fine - no rust on it, generally good condition. Tyres good, exhaust good, had a chunk of service work inc timing belt etc 4 years ago. 

With a fresh MOT it’s worth £1000 max. And that’s the rub - the MOT is due and I reckon it’s going to need at least a few hundred quid of suspension work. Is it worth doing?

On the one hand, it’s worth virtually nothing without an MOT so would effectively be scrapped (can’t be bothered with the hassle of selling privately). On the other hand I don’t really need it any more - it’s handy but far from a necessity so spending a few hundred (plus insurance is due which is only £150-odd but still), seems a waste of money.

Speak to any local parts dealer you have around you to source a new one. they really aren't that expensive for such an older car or use Napa/Euro car parts website to find the one you need and maybe try Ebay if you don't have a local parts dealer. 

If it still says 12, I'd look to find a Automotive Electrician as they can generally do call outs and are mobile, they can come test and replace the battery as well as any leads in case there's corrosion or problems with the connectors.

The honest worst case scenario here I can see, being it's electronic is that you have a failed Alternator. So whilst you are charging the battery, the car is no longer sending charge naturally back into it.

1n90rfi,Should I respray wheels before or after getting new tyres fitted?,"Hi all,

I’ve got a spare set of wheels with knackered tyres that I want to fit brand new tyres on. The wheels are flaking, with some of them still in primer and definitely need a respray.

I’ve sprayed wheels a few times before with good results, always with the tyres on. I usually just deflate them a little and use the card trick around the edge to avoid overspray.

My question is: is it better to get the new tyres fitted first and then respray, or respray them before?

If I respray first, I’m worried the tyre fitter will chip the paint at the edges when fitting the tyres (we all know they can be heavy handed). I'm pretty certain a DIY paint job will chip at the rim. This means I'll need to respray twice.

But if I fit tyres first, I’ll have to mask them off as usual. I'll just need to be careful of over spray on new tyres (but I'm good at avoiding that)

I’ve noticed a trend where people swap out their wheels without making any other modifications. This seems especially common among those who’ve just bought a car. For instance, their first post is about picking up the vehicle, and by the very next day it’s sitting on replica BBS wheels at stock ride height.

Fuel economy, road noise, and ride quality are almost always negatively affected when switching to lower-profile tyres, and any potential weight savings are negligible on a stock setup.

This behaviour makes me wonder if some people have an “I need to modify my car” complex. A kind of psychological compulsion to make visible changes immediately after purchase, regardless of the make, model, or whether those changes improve performance or aesthetics. It seems to be less about practical benefits and more about standing out.

I just wanted to ask a little bit of advice if possible. I got my driving license last year, and before that I was driving about half a year waiting and preparing for my exam, so in total I have been driving for 1.5y. In the past year I saved up as I have been meaning to buy a car. My budget is about 5k. 
So far I have been driving my parents 2014 Ford Focus. Since when I started my search I been looking at loads of different cars, to be honest I was looking at all kinds of car, as I been looking at anything which it’s not a hatchback, either a saloon or a coupe, anything around that sort, but I am not a complete idiot and I do realise that around my budget my options are quite limited. 
I personally have been looking at japanese cars like Mazda’s are they are known for their reliability and also for their overall feel. 
However my parents have been insisting that I got for a German car, an Audi or a BMW. And as my father at least knows more about cars than I do, I decided to at least give it a look. 
By chance I saw this BMW which is within my budget, and seems to be relatively ok. 
Manual, petrol, 81k miles, 3 owners, stated that it has both rear parking sensors and Bluetooth attachments.
I know the mileage is a bit high, but aside from weekend shopping, and maybe an outing once a week, but aside from that i wouldn’t be utilising it that much. Maybe between 5k and 10k a year. 
I have looked around, and i seem to be divided, as I can only see people who would live and die in a Beamer and people who would rather not even touch it with a rotten stick.

Nor is it particularly scenic. The run between Bicester and Aylesbury is covered in potholes and HS2 works. Then you’ll have to get through the steaming turd that is Aylesbury. After that it’s boring dual carriage way down to London. 

The M40 route isn’t much prettier, nice as it cuts through at Stokenchurch, and then sweeps around the banked elevated section at Wycombe, but it’s you get better views heading north on this section. 

At the bottom end of the journey as a real
world benefit there’s you avoid more of the M25 if you use the A41. 

Planned a route out based on a few runs I enjoy doing in the Aston.

1n8ru1x,Is a 2015 Ford Fiesta 1.0L Zetec petrol manual car good?,"I’ve just passed my driving test and I’m looking at buying my first car for commuting to placement. I found a 2015 Ford Fiesta 1.0 Zetec 5dr (100PS). It's petrol, manual, and has 36,687 miles. MOT history shows some advisories of brake pads wearing thin, discs worn, rear axle bushes slightly worn. It's currently at £6400 but fresh in stock at the dealership, so might be lower, and I know I have room to negotiate with them. I also learnt to drive with a fiesta. 

I know nothing about cars, but I'm worried about the whole EcoBoost ""EcoBoom"" thing with the wet timing belt that I've seen being talked about, especially with a 2015 fiesta. Is this something I should be worried about? 

Also, is it a good deal in general, considering I want to buy from a dealer and the price could be lowered through negotiation, or should I chance my luck and wait for something else to pop up?
