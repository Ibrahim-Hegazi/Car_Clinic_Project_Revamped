1njtdds,2018 Dodge Journey catalytic converter,"So my engine light came on a week ago and I had a test ran. PO420.

Guy tells me I need to get a new catalytic converter. Thing is, I bought this car just over 10 months ago, it now has 90k miles on it, when I bought it, it was at 74k.. meaning, they sold it to me with 6k miles left under federal emissions warranty. Now, I‚Äôm out of warranty and need a new converter on a car I‚Äôve had for 10 months. How do I handle this with them cause I absolutely do not want to pay full price for this. Also, here‚Äôs a pic of my exhaust. If anyone wants to chime in on how bad it is based on the photo, go ahead. I‚Äôm clueless here.

The cat is right after the exhaust manifold(s) and you can't tell by looking at it, the code is evidence of how bad it is.

Troy-Dilitant (Score: 1): The picture offers no clues of anything. It looks pretty normal.

There are a number of possibilities for P0420:

Leaded fuel was used where unleaded was called for (unlikely) 

A damaged or failed oxygen / O2 sensor 

Downstream oxygen sensor (HO2S) wiring damaged or connected improperly 

The engine coolant temperature sensor is not working properly 

Damaged or leaking exhaust manifold / catalytic converter / muffler / exhaust pipe 

Failed or underperforming catalytic converter (likely) 

Retarded spark timing (unlikely in modern computer managed engines)

The oxygen sensors in front and behind the converter are reporting too similar of readings 

Leaking fuel injector or high fuel pressure 

Cylinder misfire 

Oil contamination

(Read more at: https://www.obd-codes.com/p0420

I personally think it more likely to be the O2 sensor(s) if they haven't ruled it out by diagnostics. 

You can get aftermarket/universal convertors and have an exhaust shop weld it in; but they have a very poor reputation for lasting long.

You'll have to pay whichever is the problem if it was purchased ""as-is""."

1njoqqf,Scraping Sound When Braking!,"I've noticed recently I have a scraping sound coming from my front passenger wheel. One scrape per wheel rotation. Sounds like metal on metal. It seems I only hear it when the brakes heat up to a certain temp. I say that because it only comes around when going down a steep hill or grade. I've just replaced brakes and rotors today thinking it was an issue with the pads or rotors. While bedding in the new pads I heard it still. I know I have a wheel bearing (have parts on the way) on that same side wheel that makes a very similar sound when turning. Could the heat of the brakes be amplifying the sound of the bad bearing? Has anyone gotten a similar sound from maybe a dragging caliper? Pistons did compress but required some more pressure than usual. Guide pins were also cleaned and regreased. 
Obviously I know it can't be just diagnosed by reading a paragraph! But if anyone has any off the top of their head answer in which direction to look, I'd appreciate it!

**HOLD STEADY**: Now hold your vehicle speed steady at 55mph for three minutes. During this time the Oxygen Sensor O2 response, Air Intrusive (AIS System), EGR Flow, Purge Valve, Misfire Detection, and Fuel Trim diagnostics will be performed  
  
**DECELERATE:**¬†During this step you want to slowly let off the accelerator pedal. Do not brake or shift in order to slow down. It is important to let the vehicle coast along gradually slowing down to 20 mph. The ECU will once again self-test the EGR System, EVAP Purge System and Long Term Fuel Trims.

**ACCELERATE**: Go ahead and accelerate again at 3/4 throttle until 55-60mph is reached. This will perform the same self tests as during the first acceleration step.

**HOLD STEADY**: Hold steady speed once again. This time at 55mph for five minutes. During this time, in addition to running the self-tests as during the first HOLD STEADY step, the ECU will perform the catalyst monitor diagnostics. If the catalyst (Catalytic Converter) is marginal or the battery has been disconnected, it may take 5 complete driving cycles to determine the state of the catalyst,or in order to Complete the CAT Monitor.

**DECELERATE**: This will perform the same diagnostics as in the first Deceleration. Remember not to press your s brake or shift gears during deceleration.

To me that looks like it would be a wiring issue or a bad module. I would dare say something common to all the modules listed. Modern cars connect modules via the can bus. Can bus is just a communication protocol  what they do is that they divide the bus into different branches. So lets say 5 modules.in one branch, 7 on the other etc. If you knew how they were connected by looking at the electrical diagram I'm willing to bet that all the modules shown in your video live in the same branch. Sometimes when one module goes bad or there is an issue with it it can take out other modules on the same branch. 
So what kind of thing could be bad. Well, it could be an actual bad module, a bad power or signal cable to one module, a bad connector or sometimes corroded connector etc.

 now .. get the engine started.. with a long needle nose plier.. squeeze the fuel hose between the new filter and pump inlet closed with one hand.. with the other hand grab the throttle and bring it up to around 2000 RPMs.. in 20 seconds or so. the fuel level will start to drop in the fuel bowl.. when the engine starts to stumble.. release the pliers.. this sends a surge of fuel thru the wide open needle and seat.. flushing out any sediment. do this twice. 

 if your secondary is dribbling.. same procedure with a friend on the pliers.. open the primary throttle slightly with one hand.. the other hand open the secondary.. keep it under 3000 RPMs. this hopefully will empty the secondary fuel bowl .. release the hose to perform the same as on the primary..

 you do not have to take apart the carb..

1njf9p9,Has my head gasket finally blown?,"Hello,

I'm pretty devastated. I noticed that my 2011 Subaru Outback 2.5 (CVT version) with 150k miles was making a falling water sound upon startup recently. I checked the radiator and the coolant level was slightly low, while the overflow reservoir was dead on at the full mark as it always has been. Looking in the radiator, there is no milky substances and no residue on the radiator cap. I rented a system pressure test kit for the radiator and it leaks from 16 PSI to 14 PSI in about 10 minutes. Got the car up this morning to check underneath and found this sight. The other wet stuff under the car is just fluid film, which I applied a month ago and this blue coolant was not visible at that time. There sadly isn't enough room for me to get the camera in the space above the heat shield and with the rust, it would be near impossible to get the exhaust off to check without breaking the bolts. Does anybody know where the head gasket is on this? Is it to the right of that big allen/socket bolt?

I cannot see any other coolant residue near the radiator, none of the hoses look cracked and I don't see leaking on the top of the engine. I check the level every few months and I changed the coolant according to the book schedule (along with all other scheduled maintenance) with OEM long life super blue Subaru coolant and added the Subaru conditioner when I changed it along with the thermostat (also OEM), both of which were last changed about 30k miles ago/2 years back and the air in the system was bled while the front was up and the air was purged and until recently there was no coolant missing from the radiator). The water pump was changed last at 90k with OEM as well. I have not ever had any temperature lights on the dash and probably caught this before it got bad.

I appreciate any insights you have on working with these boxer engines and if you've seen this before and have any tips, that would be a life saver, because I do not have the money for a new car right now.

Thank you!",1,1758120657.0,3,MechanicAdvice,1758224065,2025-09-17 14:50:57,2025-09-18 19:34:25,"micknick0000 (Score: 1): >Does anybody know where the head gasket is on this? Is it to the right of that big allen/socket bolt?

Put the tools down and step away from the vehicle.

The 235/40ZR18 tire is roughly 2.3 inches shorter in overall diameter than the 235/50ZR18.

If you go ahead and do this your speedometer will be off. Because the tire is smaller, it will need to spin faster to cover the same distance. Whatever your speedometer reads, you will actually be going slower.

The shorter sidewall offers less road cushioning which makes your alloys more likely to be damaged from potholes, curbs, and other more. The ""ZR""  says it's a high-performance, low-profile tire, in this reinforces this risk.

The reduced sidewall flex will make for a harsher, less comfortable ride, as the tire is less able to absorb bumps and imperfections in the road."

Nitrogen in tires is another one.

In theory it makes sense that nitrogen in tires is better. Nitrogen molecules are bigger than oxygen and also aren‚Äôt as temperature sensitive.

In aviation we service aircraft tires with 100% nitrogen. Even go as far as having trailer that can generate 100% nitrogen from the air for servicing.

For aircraft it makes sense since you‚Äôre going through large temperature changes and generating heat when you take off or land.

Again, just remove the loose crap do not try and take material off so it looks like a freshly machined part, especially on the head side.

Blow the bolt holes out with a rag over top.  If excessively dirty spray brake cleaner down the bolts holes and blow out again.  Thread chase with an old bolt by cutting length wise slots and run up and down all holes.  I don‚Äôt think this is always necessary but on an engine of this vintage it would probably be advisable.

As for the soot leave it alone.  Making scratches and score marks on the pistons trying to clean it is worse than the soot.  You don‚Äôt appear to have a ton and the 22re isn‚Äôt exactly know for its performance and high cylinder temps.  It will be fine.

Remember to wipe the cylinder walls clean and apply some oil back on them prior to putting the gasket down.  Put a small dab of silicone underneath and on top of the gasket where the timing cover meets the block otherwise it will likely leak slowly from there.

1njt530,2019 Accord steering feels loose and wobble/play in the wheel," I had a front passenger side wheel bearing replaced a few months ago, followed by an alignment. And ever since then I've had this issue with my steering. Before I go into it I want to mention that I've already taken it back to have it looked over twice, once to the shop that did the original repair, and again to a different shop for a second opinion.

To describe the issue, it's not overly noticeable but there is this loose play in the steering wheel that I never had before. It almost feels like I'm driving over a slippery road surface and just can't control the car as well or keep it straight. It feels weird when parking, and feels like it keeps drifting all over the road. When trying to correct it, there's this vague play in the wheel until I hit a ""notch"" and then it over-corrects the other way. When I'm slowing down to a stop I feel like I need to continuously move the wheel left/right/left/right to stop straight. If I hit even a small bump the steering wheel moves a lot. I've driven my car for 6 years and know how it normally behaves, it always felt really sharp and controlled before. 

The original shop I took it to said that everything was operating normally, but that it fell out of alignment again. They re-aligned it, but I still had the same issue. I took it to a different shop a few weeks later and they told me the same thing, that everything was operating normally, but again it fell out of alignment. They re-align it but again, I still have the same issue. 

I don't know why it keeps falling out of alignment because I never hit any curbs, big potholes or anything like that. And every time I take it in, they can't replicate the issue and tell me that everything is fine. They give it an alignment but it doesn't fix it. I've set all the tire pressures to the exact factory specs and still have it. 

It's driving me crazy and every place I take it to says that nothing is wrong. The only thing I can figure at this point is the shop used a poor quality aftermarket wheel bearing that's messing with the steering and doesn't sync well with the other original OEM bearings. But I don't know if I want to shell out another $400 to have it replaced only to possibly have the same problem. 

Any advice? ",1,1758152888.0,2,AskMechanics,1758224065,2025-09-17 23:48:08,2025-09-18 19:34:25,"No-Concern3297 (Score: 1): That‚Äôs toe angle.  It makes steering feel like it over reacts, harder to stay in your lane.

Cummins always screws up their first batch of engines in some way or another and the 16's and first half of 17 are a risk.

1njrsvw,Persisting shaking 2005 Camry,"Persistent shaking 2005 Camry

2005 Toyota Camry XLE: 315,000 miles:

My memory is a little fuzzy but I‚Äôm trying to recall the details as best I can. 

A couple of years ago I bought new wheels for my 2005 Camry. A previous auto repair shop had told me I had a bent rim as I had experienced some shaking in my wheels when driving on the highways. But nothing too serious. But with the car being so old I decided to get new rims from Discount Tire. I didn‚Äôt get the absolute cheapest rims, but maybe like the next to cheapest. They are Vision brand rims. 
I also had new Michelin Tires put on as well. 

When I got the car back from Discount Tire as soon as I got it on the highway and hit around 70mph a the front wheels started to shake. So I immediately took it back to Discount Tire. They discovered one of the balancing weights had come off. So when I got it back I got on the highway again and it started shaking again. So I immediately took it back. They said everything was perfectly balanced. They ended up swapping the front wheels to the back as an experiment. When I got on the highway this time the shaking seemed to have stopped. They couldn‚Äôt really explain this to me well but they said it could possibly be something with the wheels. But since the shaking was gone I didn‚Äôt think much about it and went with it. 

Well, I drove with the tires swapped like this for a year as I didn‚Äôt want to have the shaking. I put off on rotating the tires. After a year or so I decided for the longevity of the tires I should have them rotated and balanced. So of course when the rears were brought to the front I am getting the shaking again around 70mph. 

I decided to take the car to a different auto repair place and I explained the situation. The car also needed aligned so I figured this would be a good time to address this shaking once and for all. 

They confirmed they could feel the shaking as well, but they said my tires were in balance. They could see nothing visually wrong with the wheels. They even tried swapping the wheels around and they said the shaking was occurring no matter which wheels were in a given position. Their only theory was that since these wheels were not ‚Äúhub centric‚Äù that it could be causing shaking. I told him I didn‚Äôt know what this meant. He explained to me that when the wheels are a different size not perfect matched to the car‚Äôs hub, that they need to use spacers to eliminate the space gap. So I asked if my car had these spacers and he said it did. But he said maybe because the rims themselves weren‚Äôt perfectly matched to the size of the Camry that maybe that‚Äôs causing the issue. Everything I‚Äôve read online makes it seem as long as you have these spacers that there should be no issue, right?  The auto repair place said unless they could swap on some Toyota rims they couldn‚Äôt say what‚Äôs causing the issue. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I just got these rims not that long ago. I don‚Äôt want to buy another set on just a theory. Has anyone else experienced something like this? What would be the best course of action?

1njrglt,Knock under front wheels of used car immediately after driving away from dealership,"I recently bought a 2008 Mazda Premacy from a dealership and service center. The car was purchased on the 15/9/25 (15th of September 2025). I am writing this post three days after purchsse 18/9/25 (18th of September 2025). I've attached the service sheet which has outlined what has been done. Note the line ""other: KNOCK FROM TIE ROD ENDS RH & LH"". The car is warranted and registered.

I was told by the salesman the car was in good condition and had no known faults. Wasn't sent the service sheet until AFTER I purchased the car, via email the same night. As soon as I drove off the lot I noticed a soft knocking noise and some play in the front end of the car when driving over any surfaces of the road that weren't entirely smooth.

I checked over the service sheet and noticed the note about the knocking tie rod ends and how it doesn't stayed whether they were replaced like the other parts of the sheet. I emailed the salesman the following day to tell him I'd like to take the car in to their garage to get checked and the problem remedied.

I received a reply from the parts and service manager of the service center attached to the dealership instead of the salesman who sold me the car. I've attached the screenshotted email as well. 

I have rang reception at the service center and was given an appointment for next Tuesday, 23/9/25 (23rd of September 2025) at 8:30AM.

I've parked up the car and won't be driving it until the appointment. I've only driven it for two days around town (during Tuesday the 16th and Wednesday the 17th). This is due to the problem becoming significantly worse.

The car has a lot of play and sways a lot driving over small bumps. There is a very noticeable knock/clunk and the car feels like I'm driving a horse carriage. I don't feel safe driving it.

The rocking motion has been there before the pad change, but I changed them myself so there might be something I missed.

It‚Äôs not uncommon for front-disk rear-drum setups to spit out warped rotors. Drum brakes simply do not absorb that much load and heat compared to the front disks so it‚Äôs pretty uncommon for them to wrap. It‚Äôs something you can test with a few specialty tools, front at lest.

For rear - you can test if it‚Äôs warped by using the emergency brake to slow down. That will show you what those pads feel like without influence from the front. 

You should at least inspect the rear end shoes, make sure there‚Äôs life on them.

Most brake pads don't label which side is which since most people doing it already know from experience. Also not 100% important it's on the correct side, but best practice to be.

Truthfully I'm not even sure how you killed pads in 4,000 miles. I pad slapped (replace pads and nothing else) the last time I did brakes, fully knowing the rotors were rough. Pads are cheap, I had no time, and it's my vehicle. It's been over 30,000 miles now and I've driven the car hard. 
Are you cleaning all the moving parts, and reappling brake caliper grease/lubricant to the proper areas? Without this, brakes can bind, and drag, which will wear them out quickly.
Also a bad brake line can cause a restriction and not release the brakes. 

Also, do all pads look like they wore the same? If not, this shows an issue. 
At 4,000 miles, that is an issue, but one you need to investigate. Either bad pads that fell apart, or something else?"

1njhsxz,Changed Rear Diff oil... Part 2,"So as recommended by so many people in the previous post, I have collected a sample of the rear diff. oil.

First thing that struck me: there was so much oil sprayed all over the bottom of the truck and the trailer behind it (my wife was hauling a utility trailer, probably 3000lb total weight trailer + load), that I was anticipating very little oil left.

But when I pulled the fill plug, it was overflowing with oil.  
Did the shop overfill it?  Or is there somewhere else that oil may have been leaking from?

So I do have a sample, just not sure it's from the correct location?

I have tried calling the lube location and left a message for their manager to call me back, waiting for that.  We did try calling them that same evening, but it was a Saturday evening, and they were already closed.

For reference, this was first thing this morning, air temperature probably 5 - 8 Celsius (41 - 46F).  I know I need a lab to independently test this, but for my curiosity, does it still look thin in this video?

(Here's the first part: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMechanics/comments/1nhpk4n/changed\_rear\_differential\_oil\_three\_hours\_later/)

  
**Update 1:**   
I did hear back from the place that did the original change.  I sent the video showing oil dripping out. The manager said that could not have anything to do with their work, because they fill from the rear, and the leak is from the front.  That wasn't a particularly convincing answer to me, though I am still open to the idea that this is just a bad coincidence - still trying to determine that. 

I told him my biggest concern was that many people had viewed the video and felt the oil looked very thin.  I asked him if it looked like gear oil to him, he said definitely it looks like gear oil and that our vehicle received 70w140, which the manufacturer recommended.  I asked if it looked like the correct viscosity from the way it was dripping, and he said yes.   

He also said that the reason it was leaking so much was because they refilled it, and thus there was no more to leak.  That makes sense to me, but it doesn't explain why the vehicle suddenly started to vibrate or shudder, which neither of us had ever noticed before. 

So I will have to ensure the garage that quoted on repairs didn't refill with oil, and if not, then I will proceed to get what I have tested.

1njfgli,2013 Jetta - new radiator fans + shroud completely missing a temp pigtail??,"Hey everyone,

I replaced the radiator fan shroud (with new fans) in my sisters 2013 gas 2.0 Jetta.

The fans work perfect when supplied 12v directly from battery (and old one didn't)

The issue is...there just isn't a pigtail for the coolant temp sensor (on the radiator outlet, G83 I believe)

Using my OBDI reader I could get a coolant temperature that seems accurate, but the fans never turned on.

The first pic is the new shroud-side connector, second pic is the old shroud-side connector with the pigtail

I'm totally at a loss here, I can't find anything on the forums or any other shrouds that have the pigtail (Amazon or RockAuto)...the Jetta is a ""Canada Edition"" (trendline I think, lowest trim)

1njehd5,2014 Jeep Wrangler 3.6 oil cooler re and re and re....advice?,"So I figured id ask the pros for advice. Im a DIY guy and have moderate knowledge of basic wrenching, but I just can't figure this one out and am almost ready to send it to the stealership.

Background: This is my 78 year old dads daily driver. He bought it new and outside of brakes/oil changes its been a great vehicle. Until this began.

A year ago it started blowing out oil. Dad thought he could take it to Canadian Tire and get them to ""tighten something"" and of course it ended up being the oil cooler housing. He paid handsomely for the repair and it fixed the problem for about ten months.

Then, same thing.

I figured the tech would have used the Dorman aftermarket one but he didn't. So I ordered up the Amazon all aluminum one and did the first re and re myself. The replacement Canadian Tire cooler had the plastic base with aluminum (heat sink?) at the top. No obvious breaches but I know without being able to pressure test it....well...

So I put in the solid aluminum one from amazon with the provided O rings. This lasted for about a month. Same result, oil filled the well of the ""V"" in the block until it spilled out the back.

I read online that the problem was the orings, so I ordered the Mopar OEM o rings this time to use with the aftermarket kit.

I pulled the aluminum housing and a couple of the orings were for sure ...problematic. Found out after that the earlier models (this one) used a smaller O ring (red) that info was provided with the mopar kit. 

They did in all fairness seem completely, better. The fittment was easier, it seated nicer, and I thought we had it.

Until this morning. Same thing.

FFS.

Ive racked my brain trying to figure this out. I followed the torque specs. Right rings in right place. It seated gently and snugly. 

The only thing I didn't do was lubricate the orings before putting them on. Nothing said to do that anywhere but....maybe...???

Im almost leaning towards trying an OEM chrysler kit. He got ten years out of the first one. 

He wants to try the mopar orings with the canadian tire housing which I didn't throw out. Im a little hesitant on that one.

1njc3jk,Aux.belt routing and length. Renault Master,"Dear mechanics of Reddit,

3000km ago I had a certified Renault Mechanic change both the timing belt and the accessory belt. The latter one snapped a few days ago. Weird. That's 147.000km too early.

I replaced it with a belt of the same length (6PK1148). A day later I noticed a rattling sound from the belt's direction, only at low rpm.

Turns out the tensioner, which jumps a lot on my apparently fixed-pulley alternator, is bottoming out at the low-tension (unloaded) side despite the belt being the same length as the old and old-old belts. At high rpm things smooth out, but this is to be expected when taking in account the physics of things.

Pulleys all seem to run smooth and straight, but also pretty hot, especially the alternator one. My cheap laser thermometer measured 75¬∞C after 5-10 minutes idle.

To the questions:
- The tensioner jumping is seen as an issue of a faulty overrunning pulley. This alternator seems to have a fixed pulley which I guess that behaves more or less like a faulty oap. What worries me here is the temperature. The last belt snapped way too early; could this be due to the temperature of the pulleys?

- The tensioner bottoming out on the low-tension (unloaded) side of the pulley. Obviously that's not a worn tensioner, as a weak spring would have it bottom out on the high-tension (loaded) side. Could be that the belt is too long, maybe the dud that missed QC? Or perhaps the belt routing. With the old belt snapped and off the rollers I couldn't copy the routing, so I went with what makes sense and what fits, but I now have my doubts.

I'll include pictures and a video, if Reddit allows.

LWschool (Score: 0): You actually don't want to warm up the engine during the attempt to remove - I would heat cycle it a few times with the PB blaster, but I bet that will do it.

I bought a 2009 Suzuki SX4 with an automatic transmission from my parents. It has 140k miles on it and so far has run really well, but recently I've noticed a gurgling sound that hasn't gone away. The sound happens when I accelerate from a full stop, and is more pronounced when the car is cold. It goes away when I've been driving for about a minute or two.

My father insisted it was trapped air in my coolant system but after taking care of that the problem still persisted. Recently during a routine oil change I was told my transmission fluid looked burnt. I called up a local mechanic that my family has used for years and asked if I could schedule to have my transmission fluid changed. Once he heard the car's mileage and that my parents had never changed the fluid though, he said that I should just leave it alone and not change it. He said it could cause a lot of damage to my car if I did it anyways. 

I've checked the transmission fluid levels and they're low, which I think might be causing the sound. But I'm not experiencing any issues like gear slipping, stuttering, difficulty accelerating, etc. If my mechanic insists that I could damage the car by replacing the fluid, would it also damage my car if I topped it up with new fluid? I don't want to run the risk of causing damage to the transmission by continuing to drive like this, but I also don't want to try and do a fix for it that will screw it up further.

But never got training into engine performance which is what I love. I actually need advice this time! 2004 toyota camry AT 2.4l (2AZFE), 192K. Manifold cat converter, the one thats integrated into the exhaust manifold, substrate broke in half recently, was clean white, & very brittle. 
     I was having rough idle & hard/slow hot starts I was trying to diag just before this happened. Im leaning towards fuel as it sat for 8 years & I never flushed the system before re commissioning her, plus readings beforehand suggested fuel. Flushed & replaced everything else, stupidly skipped fuel. I tried 2 cheap Manifolds, neither had a flat plane & too risky trying to force torquing it to the studs on the head. So until I can afford a good manifold plus fixing the original issue, I broke the substrate out, straight piped the secondary as it was half melted, vacuumed my whole exhaust system & ran a magnet through it to avoid any possible ingestion during valve overlap.
     Its definitely running hotter & lean. LT trims hang between 8-20%. A/F ratio gets up to 15.5:1 during heavy loads. My old school trusted mechanic said ""its fine, cars run better without cats"". Everyone else I've asked said ""hell no, you're gonna melt a piston or damage valves sooner rather than later! Get a new manifold with substrate on stat!"". Maybe my guy misunderstood me & thought I only gutted the secondary cat.
    What is the real risk here? Been running this way about 3 weeks, driving 20 miles a day tops. Temp gauge hasn't gone past normal op temp. I plan on ordering a manifold in the next few weeks, plus a fuel filter, pressure regulator, & possibly injectors, but money is tight!

I'm having issues with our Honda Civic, misfiring on one of the cylinders, limp mode, sounds really rough and the latest suspicion is that it's the fuel injectors. Local garage wouldn't look at them (too nervous about replacing them at ¬£300 each if it doesn't turn out to be the cause) so I had it towed to the dealership I bought it from. Fuel system is under warranty apparently so I'm hoping at least we can save ¬£300 for each one they need to replace ü§û

The full list of problems I've had are so far:  

* AA driver convinced me to take the car back to my house and for me to try to fix it on my drive the next day (said it was the coil ""for sure"" and it was a ""¬£20 part"" that's on every parts supplier's shelves and I could save hundreds not paying the garage to do it)
* Couldn't get hold of the parts locally myself (turned out they're ¬£60 each too) so I limped it down to a local garage that were able to look at it same day - they swapped the coils & spark plugs but wouldn't do any more, advised me to take it back to the dealer I bought it from 
* Got it towed to the dealership last week, earliest they could book it in for was today 
* AA wouldn't come out again for free as it classed as a ""second call out"" (even though the original driver said his report was worded such that I *could* get a second call out for free if the coils didn't fix it) so I had to pay a local company for the tow out of my own pocket - ¬£160
* Also somehow the above arrangement did me out of the free 3 day car hire from the AA, so I've been paying for a hire car for a week now, cost of ¬£400 including 2nd driver, waivers, etc
* Car was finally looked at today, but didn't actually go into the workshop until mid afternoon and then at the end of the day was told: sorry, we've run out of man hours, next available slot is next week (!!!) 
* Hire car is due to go back tomorrow but the dealer said there's no guarantee of a courtesy car tomorrow onwards as they book them all out in advance, phone in the morning and see what we can do etc etc also you can't keep it if we're waiting for a part (this sounds crazy too) And so I'm potentially looking at having to extend the hire car for another week costing another ¬£400 and even then no guarantee that they'll fully fix our car on the day.

Questions:

If I do have to extend the hire car for another week then I'm almost a grand into a financial hole at that point without even having our car fixed yet (!) and feel like I keep stumbling into error after error on my part - what am I doing wrong? I feel like I'm normally quite savvy with money saving and making smart risk averse decisions to save money, but with this issue I keep hitting hurdle after hurdle at trying to do things in a cost effective way. Have I any leeway to get the garage to cough up and give me the courtesy car indefinitely while they sort the issue out? Or would you be kicking off about them booking us in, getting us into the workshop late, and then putting us back at the end of the queue when they run out of time?

I just feel like that part in particular is fairly BS; if I was booked to do a job in my line of work and couldn't do it in the allotted time, it wouldn't go to the back of the queue a week later, I'd have to jump on it first thing the next day and finish it off. What happens if they run out of time next week? Back to the end of the queue again a week later??

Do I have any recourse with the AA after being given advice that in the end did me out of a follow up tow and free hire car for 3 days?

Just looking for any general advice to try to rescue a shitty situation and try to stop burning money on this. We need a car every day to get the kids to nursery & school (currently, in different towns) and my wife to work in a third town. And then do the whole thing in reverse at the end of the day. No family within an hour of us so we certainly can't ask them to come over twice a day to do the pickups & drop offs. We are truly stuck without a car.

1njl4za,Helping choosing a second hand car? Honda?,"Good morning!

I am moving back to France after 2 years abroad, and I need to buy a new car when I return. I live in the countryside so diesels are alright. I am English so would like the CarTalk UK opinion. 

After a long search, I'm going to buy a Honda.

I have 3 cars to choose from that fall within my budget (6-8k euros, yes car prices outside the uk are nuts), and of the whole market they are the only ones that fit my criteria of being fun to drive, reliable, and not too expensive.

To start there‚Äôs the Honda civic 8th generation from 2006-2011, with the bulletproof R18, 1.8L vtec petrol with 140 horsepower. Supposed to be fun, but it's starting to look a bit tired and dated.

The Honda civic 2012-2015 in 1.6L I-dtec diesel, reliable, super low fuel consumption, supposed to be less fun than the civic 8, but more modern.

And my favorite, which unfortunately is not the most spacious, the 2010 Honda CR-Z, 1.5L petrol engine with hybrid battery, reliable, fun, low fuel consumption, but essentially a 2 seater as the rear seats are useless. (IMA hybrid batteries last a long time, but in case of replacement between 700-1500).

I'm going on road trips next year, so I need comfort, but fun on twisty roads, and then for the future I have no idea, but I would like to buy a car that I can try and keep for 10 years. When it starts to be too dated I would like to keep it as a project. Most of the work I will do myself, and otherwise my mechanic is a Honda specialist, so good prices on that side too.

So here they are, I can't choose between the 3, and if ever please make suggestions for other options, I'm not against buying a jazz either.

Thank you!!

1njgdil,Mazda 3 - Reddit Might Have Been Right All Along,"It's a long-standing joke that the answer to any ""What car should I get"" question on here is the Mazda 3, well I got to try one today as I had a hire car for work. I like Mazda's; my parents had 626's and 6's when I was young as the family car, and my first time behind the wheel of a car was my dad's old 626, but I was a bit sceptical about how much Reddit loves the Mazda 3

And... you know what, fair play Reddit, it's really nice!!

Being a hire-car it's a basic example, but Mazda (Unlike Ze Germans) doesn't skimp on the equipment, so it had heads-up display, heated seat, nav and all the electronic guidance gubbins. I don't like most Auto Cruise Control systems (especially VW's) because I've always felt I have to fight it, but the Mazda one is really well thought out; if you've had to slow down and are making an overtake, it even gives a little burst of throttle during lane changes to help get the speed up. It's the first ACC system I have been happy to just do it's thing.

The hvac is all proper buttons, and there's no stupid haptics on the steering wheel controls; buttons and toggle switches all round. And they ARE just better! I'm sorry, but anyone who thinks haptics and touch screens are better is just wrong.

It's a joy to drive, and the engine... instead of the usual turbo charged 1.2, 1.6 or 2.0, Mazda obviously decided Turbo's are the devil's tools and so have made a N/A 2.5l 4-cyl. It's not particularly powerful with only 138bhp but it does pull nicely and being N/A, it was happy to rev, so was kind of fun. And was just as efficient as the 25-Plate E200 I'd had the previous week (Also a hire car), both doing 50mpg on a drive from Birmingham to Reading.

And it felt better built than the E-Class, and much more refined. The E-Class suffered from a lot of road noise while the Mazda was nice and quiet. I've had Fiat 500's, Corsa's, Golf's and the E-Class but the Mazda3 has been by far my favourite.

So I'm here to say Reddit: you are right, the Mazda 3 *is* the answer.",49,1758123137.0,22,CartalkUK,1758224065,2025-09-17 15:32:17,2025-09-18 19:34:25,"Princ3Ch4rming (Score: 14): Yep, the Mazda 3 is a properly good car.

* My car ""cleaned"" after service looked like a 5-year-old did it
* Refused courtesy car for warranty work earlier this year

When collecting it, suddenly they're saying there's ""physical damage"" and work might not be covered after all, need more time to investigate - very vague and unconvincing.

I‚Äôm looking for some advice before I commit to buying my first car.

I have the following car on offer from a family member:

- 2012 VW Polo, 1.2 petrol, ~30k miles
- Price: ¬£3,000‚Äì3,500 (family member, so below market ‚Äì WBAC says ~¬£4k).
- Full service history.
- Unsure on past use: Previously owned by my aunt (who has since passed) ‚Äì I think it may have been mostly short trips, but I‚Äôm not certain.
- Current owner (last 2 years) hasn‚Äôt used it much - mostly occasional 20‚Äì30 min journeys or local shop runs.
- Hasn‚Äôt been driven much in the past year. A reason for the sale as they have decided to stop driving. They‚Äôre old. 
- I plan to get a garage to look it over before deciding.

My situation / use case:
- I recently passed my test earlier this year, insurance will be ~¬£1,400/year.
- I need a car for work: I have to go on construction sites 1‚Äì3 times a week. Public transport takes 1.5‚Äì2 hrs each way, but car is 40-60 mins each way and much more practical (sites are isolated, not accessible without a car).
- Recreationally I‚Äôd probably use it 1-3 times a week 
- I‚Äôd like to save for a house and buy in ~2 years, so I‚Äôm conscious of costs. Housing is cheap here (decent options for 100/150k). That said, this car feels like a good deal given low miles and family connection.

My questions:
1) Given its age (13 years old but only 30k miles), is this a solid buy or could I run into issues from underuse/short trips?
2) Is ¬£3‚Äì3.5k fair value, or should I consider other options at that price point (different model/type)? I mean this in relation to other options. 
3) is there anything specific I should ask the garage to check over (common Polo issues, risks from low use)?
4) As a new driver, is there anything else I should weigh up before committing?
5) If not the Polo ‚Äî are there better alternatives around ¬£3‚Äì3.5k I should be looking at (e.g. Yaris, Jazz, i20, or similar)?

1nizwdq,Insurance Tips Please üôè,"Just got a new car. I currently have 1.1L 2014 Ford ka. And I have a Ford Fiesta 2021 1.0L Hybrid arriving on the 20th sep & need to get it insured! 

1ST CENTRAL WANT ME TO PAY ¬£1,800 to change over the vehicles üò°  WHAT A JOKE 

SO found another insurance company (Admiral car insurance) and they are charging A LOT LESS a month. 

So how do I go about cancelling my insurance with 1st central and how much will I be charged?? As I am not paying almost ¬£2,000 just to change vehicles!

It‚Äôs really not that difficult.

Phone insurance of old car and request to cancel the policy 


The mark as SORN with DVLA and park it off the road 


If you can't do this you'll need to keep the old car insured

1niype1,4x4 needed for winter,"Hi everyone 

I need a solid 4x4 for winter as I live in an area which is pretty high up in altitude. So basically I need it for the snow periods 

Ideally around 10-13k but can stretch my budget for the right car. (If newer and nicer)

Nothing is of the books. Just want a decent reliable motor

I have owned shoguns and pajeros in the past but these days it‚Äôs hard to come by decent ones as most are rotten or work horses, or being sold in Bradford (not necessarily a bad thing but I know people there and their practises so I tend to avoid)

I‚Äôve been looking at VW Touaregs 

What do you propose and why? 

EDIT: OK. So people are recommending tyres. Yes I know tyres make a difference but I need a whole vehicle that will be great in the snow. I know about tyres and only use good ones. I‚Äôve cross climate 2s on a Tiguan and PS4s on an rs3. Uniroyal rainsport 5s on a civic 

Edit: guys I just need recommendations for a vehicle I can use in heavy snow, I live in a rural area and NEED it. Don‚Äôt need financial advice just need a car recommendation please ",14,1758069139.0,86,CartalkUK,1758224065,2025-09-17 00:32:19,2025-09-18 19:34:25,"1995LexusLS400 (Score: 23): Tyres over a new car.

I‚Äôd assume those tyres won‚Äôt be appropriate. I live in East Anglia. Given that you live high altitude, I‚Äôm guessing there‚Äôs a lot of steep hills around. You‚Äôd be better off with some full on snow tyres on some other wheels that you swap when needed over winter bias all seasons. 4x4/AWD will be better than 2WD, however tyres are still incredibly important. All cars are all wheel brakes. If you can‚Äôt stop, then you can‚Äôt go either, regardless of whether or not it‚Äôs FWD, RWD, AWD or 4x4.¬†

I‚Äôd probably go for an Audi Allroad with that budget if you are going to buy a new car. I would say Volvo XC70 too, but Volvo stopped making them a while ago and they‚Äôre ageing. A good condition one is still good, but you‚Äôd be looking at getting a 2016 model at the newest.¬†
