I drive a 2006 Honda Civic and recently started having some weird electrical issues. The battery light flickers on and off while driving, but the car still starts normally. I’ve also noticed the headlights flicker and the stereo cuts out occasionally.

I replaced the battery since it was pretty old, but the same problems continue, and now the headlights won’t come on at all, only the signal lights work.

Here are the voltage readings I took with a multimeter:
	•	Battery (engine off): 12.8V
	•	Battery (engine running): 14.1–14.2V
	•	Alternator output: ~14.2V

1oupfpr,Cracked windshield warranty.,"TLDR: how can you tell the difference between  improper install or impact on a cracked windshield after 2 months. 

Hi, I purchased a used 2024 Kia EV9 wind from a Kia dealership in July. When we purchased it, it had huge chip right in front of the driver and the dealership offered to replace the windshield as part of the transaction. They replaced the windshield at the end of August.

 This morning I woke up to 10 inch crack running up from the center bottom edge. We went to daycare and back (3km) and parked the car. Went back to the car maybe 8h later and the crack split and is running about 5ft wide. I called the dealership and they said they can't replace it because it's obviously an impact damage. I'm heading there tomorrow morning to show them in person. 

My question is what would be  a distinguishing factor between impact damage or improper install, I don't like arguing with professionals but I don't want to be swindled out of my insurance deductible.

When I disconnect the PCM (as in the pic) and measure the resistance between the RX pin (17) and one of the ground pins (51), it reads at 4,100 ohms. Is this normal, or should this also be reading at above 10,000?

1oulot2,2010 Hyundai head bolt threads pulled out,"So family friend had a blown head gasket 2 years ago that they drove with water in the oil.  I told them the cost of a new engine or rebuild it would be 2x more than a junkyard engine and could still have issues later too.  

Well it blew a head gasket.  All at once.  Now I have the head off and engine out again, it’s obvious what happened.  The head bolts pulled the threads which seems to be a common issue.  

They make a kit to redrill and tap these things but I see thread metal on 2 head bolts in addition to the wrecked one.  

I advised to skip the machinist since the engine wasn’t overheated, have me put some straight edge the head to make sure nothing obvious, do my best to drill out using the kit, then slap it all back together.  Then trade in to a dealership and they can send to auction.   

I mean I don’t know what else to do.  As it sits it’s worth what? $500?  Back together bet the dealer will value at $1500, but at least another failure won’t come back to them.  Who knows, it might hold for another 50k or more.   But I just don’t want them throwing money at it again.  I’m already 9 hours in and know it will take another 8-10 to get all back together.  I charge them $50 an hour.  So all in all they are about $500 in at this point, scrap would be break even.

 i would want to perhaps.. tape off the cylinder deck completely. opening the holes in the tape for the head bolt holes.. so you don't scatter debris into the engine.. positioning the crank so all 4 pistons are part way down and stuffing clean rags into the bores before you tape off everything.. 

 look at the helicoil drill size.. see if you can get a really long drill from mcmaster.. measure the fit of the drill in the holes in the head..  you may be able to get some brass shim stock that you can roll into a sleeve to be able to use the head and the shim stock as a drill guide to keep the holes you are drilling dead straight with the head.. 
 
 to stop from going too deep.. you need a piece of pipe or copper tubing on the drill bit so the drill can only go thru the head so far.. 

 i don't know as i have not looked to see if those head bolts are 10MM, 11mm, 12mm  and i have no idea what the drill size will be depending on the helicoil diameter and thread pitch.. or the hole size in the head.. 

 you can freehand it. using other head bolts screwed in as a guide. 

 i keep thinking of the tech who did that with a benz 450SL engine.. i said the drill guide and solid inserts are available.. i know how to drill a straight hole he said..  i tried to tell him the holes for head bolts are not straight but he was not hearing it.. then he said the head bolts won't thread in.. i went over.. threaded a bolt into the block.. perfect 90 degrees in.. then i slid a head bolt thru the head. i don't recall the angle but his jaw dropped.. how do i fix this.. replace the short block. you can't fix this.

On the Chevy 1.4L Turbo engine, the Camshaft/Timing issues and the Fuel Pressure issues are often related:
Stretched Timing Chain (P0016): The timing chain, chain tensioner, or chain guides have failed or worn out. This allows the chain to stretch or slip a tooth, causing the physical misalignment between the crank and cams.

VVT Solenoid/Phaser Failure (P0011): Because of the poor oil pressure/sludge, the VVT Actuator Solenoids can become clogged or fail, preventing the camshaft from being correctly adjusted.

Oil Pressure Loss/Low Oil (Red Light in Video): A failing oil pump, a stuck-open oil filter bypass valve, or a severely low oil level/poor oil quality is causing the engine to lose oil pressure, especially as the RPMs surge.

High-Pressure Fuel Pump Failure (P0089/P228C): The High-Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) is located on the engine and is typically driven by the intake camshaft.
If the camshaft is misaligned (P0016/P0011), it can damage the HPFP.

If the HPFP is failing, it won't maintain the high fuel pressure required for direct injection, causing the fuel pressure codes (P0089/P228C), the engine surging, and the ""Low Power Mode.""

Conclusion and Next Steps

The combination of the flashing warning lights in your video and these specific DTCs points to a critical mechanical failure involving the timing system and potentially the HPFP, all likely exacerbated by a lubrication issue.

The car must be towed to a service center immediately. 

Driving it risks:

Engine Seizure: Due to sustained low oil pressure (flickering red light).

Catastrophic Engine Damage: If the timing chain breaks or slips further (P0016).

A qualified mechanic will need to:

Check Oil Pressure: Perform a manual pressure test to confirm the video's warning.

Inspect VVT Solenoids: Check for clogs/failure.

Inspect Timing Chain: Remove the valve cover to inspect the timing chain tensioner and guides for failure or stretching (P0016).

Test/Replace HPFP: Diagnose the fuel pressure codes (P0089/P228C) which will likely lead to the HPFP.

Hopefully this helps!

I'm trying to avoid going down the incorrect path. Is it the battery, the alternator, the starter, something else? Thank you!

Hey all, 

2017 Kia Forte - 95k miles - 5 year old battery - never been serviced for starter, alternator, electrical

A few days the TPMS and triangle with exclamation dash lights appeared and at that same time the car took a few cranks to start--it typically fires up immediately when turning the ignition. The entire dash flickered with each ""crank"", like if the power failed and restarted each time, and made a sharp ""click"" sound. From that moment on this happened every time I started the vehicle and increased in severity. It started with a single delayed ""crank"", then two, then 3, and now what we see/hear in the video (video was taken yesterday). Two days ago, I removed the battery and hooked it up to my Viking charger which said battery health 90% and charge level was at 80%. So I let it charge on 2 amps for a few hours before I had to leave--charging ended still on 80%. Car started up with only a couple of ""cranks/clicks"" and I was off. The next couple of starts were the same but after a couple of hours of being out, turning off and starting, the issue increased again. Yesterday morning, on the day the video was taken, I removed the battery again and put it back on the charger. Charge was still at 80% so I did a quick charge at 8 amps and it charged to 100% in about an hour. Put the battery back in the car and a few hours later I tried starting the vehicle and the current state began. 

Another weird symptom, I attempted to scan using my ODBII scanner and I keep getting a ""link failed"" after a huge delay on reading ""kpwm"" codes. It could be the scanner died (it's old) but just wanted to add that here in case it helps with diagnosis.

  
Since the car won't start I cannot drive it to the parts store to have the alternator/battery/starter tested and I'm hoping to avoid removing the alternator or starter unless I absolutely need to (I live in apartments where ""car repair"" isn't allowed onsite and I will incur a fine for doing so).

1ouhj9o,Can I Do A Long Distance Drive?...,"Hey y'all

V6 '98 Honda Accord Driver reporting in,

I'm preparing for a long distance drive and went to the auto parts shop to have my check engine light checked. For context, my check engine light has remained on for years, always showing code P1456 which is EVAP-related. This has been a constant.

Another important piece of context is that the engine put into the car is a new replacement V6 engine, since my old one died not too long ago. It's been driving as it should.

However, this time, a new code appeared: P0401. The printed paper the auto parts worker handed me mentioned EGR issues. I spoke with my mechanic on the phone who recommended I put a bottle of High Mileage Seafoam into the gas tank and drive it on the highway to work it through the system.

My drive is in a few days (across multiple states) and I was wondering if this would be safe to drive and if the Seafoam would truly help. How urgent is this issue?

1oug741,2019 Toyota 4runner trd pro 1GRFE: TPMS module stuck in test mode.,"I have recently purchased an Autel MaxiCheck MX808S scanner and while messing around with it I decided to use the TPMS signal check utility. The utility couldn't complete its test and created some codes and I cannot erase them and I cannot get it out of test mode. 

The TPMS light is flashing rapidly and it never shuts off or goes solid even after driving at speed for more than 50 kms. To note: the tpms system was working correctly before and if I look at the data I can still see all my sensors and the pressures/temperatures associated with them. It shows test mode as ''enabled'' and there seems no way to turn it off. 

This vehicle isn't equipped with a physical TPMS reset button and there is also no option to reset it in the instrument cluster. There is also no spare wheel TPMS sensor either 

  
Here is what I tried so far: 

Disconnecting vehicle battery for 30 mins. 

Re-initialize the sensors using the MX808. No luck on account of the active codes.

Grounding pins 4 and 13 together on the DLC3 connector to reset the TPMS system. Only outputs the codes using the flashing light on the dash and doesn't reset TPMS test mode. 

Contacted Autel customer service, they told me they had other people having the same issue recently with Toyota/Lexus vehicles and advised me to go to the dealer and have Techstream hooked up to the vehicle. 

Went to the dealer and he couldn't make sense of it, especially since during that time I removed my TPMS sensors from the car (my winter wheels don't have them). I looked on his computer and he had the same options as I have on the Autel, signal check and reinitialisation, which both don't work since there are active TPMS codes.

Tried to use an Autel dedicated TPMS scanner (TS508WF) to reset the TPMS module. No luck, it can't do anything to clear the codes or the test mode. Confirmed all my sensors are functional though. 

I have looked online and seen a few people having the exact same issue on other toyota vehicles. The only common solution seems to hook up Techstream and somehow reset the TPMS test mode. I have ordered a sketchy techstream cable online and I'm waiting on it but there's a lot of conflicting info online as to how well those things work. 

The codes it shows are: 

C2121 data from transmitter ID 1 not received (main)  
C2122 data from transmitter ID 2 not received (main)

C2123 data from transmitter ID 3 not received (main)

C2124 data from transmitter ID 4 not received (main)

C2173 Vehicle speed or engine speed signal error

Using the scanner I can see the ecu can see actualized values for vehicle speed, rpm, pressure, temperature and battery voltage in all 4 tpms sensors.

- replaced both O2 sensors
- cleaned throttle body

1oue7fr,To clean or not to clean: valve covers,"I will be replacing the valve cover gaskets on my 3UZ-FE. I see a lot of people on the internet try to clean all the sludge/varnish on the inside of the valve covers while they have them off but this seems like a double edged sword to me.

**Pros of cleaning:**

\- Reduces the total amount of sludge in the engine. But this is only a small part of the total surface area and doesn't even have any moving parts. And if there is significant sludge I would follow with frequent synthetic changes to try to clean the whole engine anyway.

\- Less chance of debris sticking on the inside while I change spark plug tube seals etc

**Cons:**

\- It seems very hard to clean it completely. This could leave chemical residues and possibly bristles etc inside the engine. And if it is only cleaned partially it is probably more likely for big chunks of stuff to fall off and cause problems. But I guess this stuff would probably get caught in the pickup/filter anyway? 

\- I would have to have the valve cover off for a couple hours while I clean and dry it, leaving more time for leaves and wasps to find their way into my engine.

1oun4vl,Exhaust Fitment Question,"Howdy

A few months ago I bought a Mustang because why not. As a Facebook marketplace enthusiast I came across some used Borla S Type’s. A low ball and 2 hr road trip later I had them back home. 

My dilemma comes in mounting them. They were taken off the previous owners cousins GT and I have a 2017 V6 model. There are some slight differences in the pipe sizing so I will need a reducer I believe.
I messed up and ordered the wrong sized reducer/clamp so before I waste more time and money returning shit on Amazon I figured I’d ask here. What size pipe adapters/clamp type would you commend for my situation? Do I just need 2.25 ID to 2.25 OD? Get a pipe expander and just eye ball it? 

I do not have a welder, measurements below were taken by hand with my (cheap) caliper. Not interested in paying someone to do this. 

Exhaust pipe in car
2.25” Outer diameter

Borla Axle back:
2.37”Outer Diameter

1ouj3i9,What is the best way to store a car outside during harsh winter?,"Hey everyone,

Basically I have a second car but live in an apartment with no garage.  
I've decided to only drive one car during the winter ( save insurance costs ), but I'm really confused about best practices for storing the car.

  
For reference, it can get -30 Celsius / -22 Fahrenheit here. I also live beside a lake where there is a lot of moisture and the snow during the winter gets blown in from the lake ( causing cars to literally be covered by snow in a single night ).

I've done a whole bunch of research with conflicting results. For example: 

* Some say you should start the car every 2 weeks, some say that hurts the car by creating moisture. 
* Getting a car cover is good, but wait - others say it causes moisture inside the cover and somehow causes damage.
* Tire flat spots are a problem! Move the car!. Oh but others say that isn't a thing anymore with new tires and you don't need to worry about it.
* You need to keep your battery charged! But others then say, don't worry about it and charge it after winter.
* Fill up the car fuel tank to reduce moisture. Except conflicting advice says it's a waste because you shouldn't keep gas for longer than a month.

And it goes on and on with conflicting advice.

So, for any of my fellow Winter car storing redditors. What do you do or what would you do in my situation?

1oufzlg,Really worried about my used car — I just want someone to tell me it’ll be okay,"Hey everyone,
I’ve been super anxious lately about my car and could really use some reassurance or advice. It’s a used car that’s about 26 years old. It needed a lot of work done last March, but since then there haven’t been any other problems. It seems to be driving normally for me, and even my dad says it runs fine when he drives it.

I use it every day to go to work, but my job isn’t too far from home — only about 13 miles each way. No warning or sensor lights come on at all, and the dashboard looks completely normal. Still, I can’t stop worrying that something’s wrong with it or that it’s going to break down soon.

The anxiety gets so bad that I sometimes make myself sick thinking about it — literally to the point of throwing up. I already struggle with anxiety issues in general, but this car thing has been eating away at me nonstop.

Even though I’m working full-time and make $19.50 an hour, I haven’t really been able to save much for another car, so I feel kind of trapped with this one. I just wish I could relax and trust that it’s fine for now.

I don’t even know what to do at this point. Has anyone else gone through something like this? How did you stop worrying every time you got behind the wheel? I just want someone to tell me it’s going to be okay.

The part about sometimes hard to push but also hard to stop is confusing to me, but it could be a bad rubber line causing that. 

If my car did that, first thing I'd do is bleed the brakes. Look up the bleeding order, they're not all the same, because of the creative ways manufacturers sometimes run the lines.

Look for anything else wrong while you're taking off each wheel. If you have disc brakes all around, you can check the calipers, make sure your guide pins are clean and lubed, and caliper pistons aren't sticking.
You can have someone else in the car, and have the press the brake for you, so you can see if each caliper does what it should, ie; squeeze the rotor when pressed, let go and return to non-braking postion when released. 

If bleeding doesn't solve it, you may have inner deterioration in one or more of the flexible rubber sections of the brake lines. They can develop flaps inside, making the tubing mostly one-way. They can let fluid flow one way, and block it the other way. You won't be able to see that from the outside.

You could have both things happening, bad rubber line(s) and air in the lines. 

If tou have to replace a bad rubber line, you should probably replace them all. They're likely to all be about the same age. If one is failing, the rest could, too, any time.

Another possibility could be a failing master cylinder. It's been a very long time since I had  master cylinder go out, and I don't remember exactly what happened. I'm sure someone else on here will know more about master cylinders than I do. 

My newest car is an '07 Nissan Versa. I've never worked on anything newer than that. There may very well be some newer innovations in brakes that I'm not familiar with.

If you're not doing the work yourself, have your mechanic check all of that.

You shouldn't get upset that they didn't interpret your results.  Maybe they didn't explain this to you but if you were at a test only station it's right in the name Test Only. 

The BAR separated the stations so a test only is prohibited from assisting you with the repair or diagnostic.  This is so they have zero incentive to sell you repairs, they are only going to test and do that test with integrity and objectively. 

If you went to a test and repair and they told you what they think is wrong you should expect to also then get billed for a diagnostic fee-usually 1hr labor.  Which would also have gotten you upset when they ask you for another $99.

They should of explained it better to you, but the only thing other than that printout you should expect is just what is their pricing policy or discount for retests or pretests once you fix your car (and fix it somewhere else).

The two major things I know I need to do are fix/replace the wiring harness which seems like it'd run me anywhere from 1500 to 2000 depending on if I need to buy a fully new one and get it installed, and tires would come out to a little under 1000 for 17 inch ~200 dollar tires. Anything major I should consider and is it even a project that you'd recommend I attempt?",2,1762827238.0,12,CarTalk,1762976191,2025-11-11 02:13:58,2025-11-12 19:36:31,"Comfortable-Unit-897 (Score: 4): Sitting for decades requires everything flexible to be replaced. $20k minimum.

I'd be happy to answer or offer specifics - my dad and I worked on ours together for 30 years. 69 Coupe, 351 Cleveland. Odds and ends, fixed all the stuff that broke over the first 10 years. At 10 yrs, engine rebuild & manual swap to a Tremec T5 5sp. At 20 yrs, bare metal body work & paint job. Major advantage with virtually rust-free body in really good shape. 

Went through 3 (cheap, used) auto transmissions before the manual swap. Couple iterations of radiators, fans. Otherwise, nothing major in those early years to keep it running, a few upgrade parts, a lot of elbow grease. Much of your cost calculus depends on how much you can do yourself, too - e.g. a wiring harness is just made of wires, if you can just figure out what's wrong and connect the wires to make it go, you can do it for just a bunch of time and a few bucks in wire. It's a pretty simple machine, as wiring goes.

MotorsportMX-5 (Score: 1): I never heard of any Honda Accord to avoid. 

They are bulletproof cars. 

But depending on the generation and the trim.

The one that comes to mind are the older V6 Honda Accords. Honda no longer makes a V6 Accord, but the V6 engines have two more spark plugs and coils you need to replace and they have a timing belt rather than a timing chain. Because of the larger engine, it also takes more oil and uses more gas. Being that the 4 cylinder engines have less spark plugs and a timing chain, it costs a little bit less to maintain and own. Because the V6 engines were powerful and are no longer offered in Honda Accords, the V6 Accords have a higher resale value. 

The newer 10th and 11th gen Accords are only offered with turbocharged engines. Turbochargers do add a little bit more complexity and cost when it comes to maintenance as turbochargers typically last 70,000 to 100,000 mi. The problem is that almost all new cars are coming out with turbochargers.

In my opinion, the best bang for the buck and the most reliable Honda Accord you could buy is the 9th gen Honda Accord with the K24 (2.4 Liter 4 cylinder) engine made from 2013 to 2017. It's K24 is a legendary Honda engine used in many of their cars. It is an engine known for easily lasting 400,000 miles. One famously reached a million miles recently. The 9th gen Accord still drives like a modern car, but you can buy them very cheap at $10,000 or less. It really is a lot of car for the money. My favorite trim is the Sport trim. It is not the most luxurious or techy trim, but it looks sportier inside and out, and has 5 more horsepower than other trim due to the dual exhaust system. 

If you have $38,000 laying around I would say go for the brand new 11th generation Honda Accord Sport Hybrid. It is a sporty looking hybrid trim. Because of the hybrid system, the engine is rarely stressed and will likely last a million miles if the battery can last too."

I had it towed and the mechanic said he put a new spark plugs swap the spark plugs from C4 oh, and cylinder six because it was reading low compression. I think he did a leak down because he said something about pouring Oil or something in and watching it, he said he did all he could do and that initially it was the engine. He didn’t try to sell anything and he didn’t charge me for the work. My sister convinced me to call the car lot and I was surprised they said, bring it in and they’ll have their mechanic look at it that he called that car was ready to be picked up and he just wanted me to sign a good faith paper so I asked him what all did his mechanic do he said put a new spark plug in and coil pack and it’s running fine. I asked if the cylinder six compression was checked and he said no I don’t know why your mechanic told you that he probably just wanted to sell you an engine and I said no, and he’s not my mechanic and he didn’t sell me anything and then I explained well if the compression isn’t fixed on cylinder six, the backfire is gonna come back and it’s not fixed and he said I’m telling you it’s the way it was when you took it off my lot. That’s your car if you wanna have the compression check go ahead and he said if you want I’ll buy the car back from you so I said OK. Could you get that paperwork ready? Will it be the 3300 for the car or will I get 3500 including the fees he said oh no I would buy it back from you at wholesale price that would be 1300. I said no thank you so I wouldn’t pick the car up so now I’m stuck with it. Is there a way possible that he rigged it to wear it quit misfiring I mean it’s not possible it’s fixed am I right?

If you want to be sure it doesn't have low compression then pay for a leak down test elsewhere and have it noted in writing. 


Not that it's going to give you leverage against against the car lot. You already own the vehicle and its as is with no warranty(presumed).

Yesterday I try to turn on the truck but it exhibits a no crank no start(dead battery). I try to jumpstart the 1yo (3year warranty evermaxx) battery and even after 10 mins it won't get enough of a charge to jump. Exhibits dead/low battery symptoms and dim lights. I leave for few hours come back to it at night and again leave it jumped 15 mins. After 2 failed weak battery cranks it reluctantly starts. I go put it in reverse and immediately notice the gauge and RPM dip and the truck wanting to shut off. Everytime I lightly step on the gas it does this (video).

Today I took the battery out and went to get it tested at AutoZone. They tested twice told me it had 0% charge. I go to Walmart to warranty the battery, they test it and it tests good but undercharged. I leave with them to charge meanwhile I go back home. Seeing as my batteries (duralast gold) over the past decade or so have not been lasting their full warranty period I suspect the alternator may be bad. I've had it tested in the years before while on the car and it's always passed. I've also never had a battery warning light indicator. Regardless, I remove it to get it bench tested. 

I go back to Walmart. They now tell me the battery is bad and they hand me a new one. GREAT. I go back to AutoZone with the alternator and they bench test it. They had a sketchy sized belt and the wrong 8mm rod mount. They test it and it passes. Being sus of the wrong testing equipment I go to O'Reilly's. They bench test it with all the proper hardware and it passes again.

101k miles

Misfire cylinder 2.

It misfires when cold w/ flashing CEL.
After it warms up it stops misfiring. When under load, misfires again. Mostly cylinder 2, sometimes a few other cylinders will randomly misfire with it.
Supposedly running rich with bank 1 -15% and bank 2 -13% ish 

Customer replaced coils and plugs before I got it. (I’ve already swapped around to make sure one wasn’t bad out of the box).
Cyl 2 spark plug wet with fuel, sold him injector cyl 2. Replaced injector with OEM GM injector. Performed injector balancing, crankshaft variation re-learn. And test drove. Misfire still present under load.
Sometimes it will randomly start missing really hard and other times lightly mis.
When you come to idle it’ll run smooth. Spark plug is always black when I remove it. Other plugs are clean. Boroscope cylinder 2, it’s very clean looking which seems normal due to previous fuel injector leak. Other cylinders look typical for 100k miles. I haven’t done compression test due to the other symptoms of running rich and random misfires on other cylinders and running good at idle, also no smoke or oil consumption issues.
Also wiggled the injector and ignition harnesses while engine running and no changes observed.
This misfire is somewhat erratic. Sometimes it’ll start up and run good. Others it’ll shit all over itself always cyl 2. Sometimes I’ll drive better and other times can barely get it above 30MPH.

I’m starting to think an issue with the ECM drivers or something of the sort.

Long story short, new spark plugs, injector, and coils. Still misfiring. Wiring seems ok. No corrosion or loose pins in connectors.

Is it better to torque to manufacturers specifications to get them to stop leaking?

1ou2qfu,Stupid Mistake Of Driving My Chevy Cruze Without a Radiator Cap,"I drive a 2016 Chevrolet Cruze, and I need some help! Yesterday, I was performing some basic checks on the engine, mainly to top off the oil and add some water to the radiator.


The Mistake

A quick side question for the Reddit mechanics: Is it generally safe to add regular tap water to the radiator for a top-up?


While I was performing these checks, my dad was with me. He told me to check the oil and the radiator, so he told me to get some water bottles and put some water inside of the radiator, then I got some emergency water bottles and threw them into the trunk so I'd have them in case of an emergency. As soon as he mentioned this, I got distracted and completely forgot to screw the radiator cap back on


The Aftermath

This morning, I drove off to university. About halfway through my trip, I noticed a strong plume of smoke/vapor coming from the A/C vents and under the hood. I immediately found a safe spot to pull over and shut the car off.
As soon as I opened the hood, I saw the source of the vapor: the radiator. It was then I connected the dots and had a sickening realization I had left the radiator cap off yesterday


The coolant had been boiling and turning to steam because the system couldn't hold pressure without the cap.


In a desperate attempt to drive the rest of the way, I poured in some more water and tried to seal the opening temporarily with a plastic bag. When I started the car again, everything seemed fine for a moment, until I heard loud bubbling from the radiator area. I opened the hood again and saw the plastic bag being pushed up and down by the escaping pressure and steam, and the coolant was still leaking. I gave up right there and then, parked the car safely, and arranged for a ride to uni.


The Urgent Question

Now I'm at uni, but I need to go back and figure out a way to seal the radiator opening, even temporarily, so I can drive it to a mechanic without it overheating again. The plastic bag clearly didn't work because I need to build some pressure to stop the coolant from boiling so easily.


What is the best way to seal the radiator cap opening temporarily so I can get to the shop?

I have physically spliced into the CANH/CANL twisted pair using proper Y-splitters, and the motor+controller communicate normally while my reader is connected  so I’m sure I’m on the correct line.

Hardware tested:

MCP2515 / TJA1050 CAN transceiver
ESP32 (TWAI mode)
Arduino Nano with MCP_CAN

Behavior:

The bike/motor display does show live speed and sensor readings, so communication between motor & controller is definitely active.However, my reader receives 0 frames. MCP_CAN never reports CAN_MSGAVAIL, TWAI driver sees nothing in listen-only mode.CANH/CANL differential voltage measured with a multimeter floats around 0.1–0.5V, not the typical ~2.5V idle differential. So something is happening, but it doesn’t look like standard dominant/recessive signaling.

What I’m wondering:

Does this type of system start communication only after a wakeup or authentication frame?

Could the bus be using silent mode / low-power wait state until a specific CAN ID is transmitted?

Is this possibly CANFD, extended ID only, or something like 500kb/250kb but gated by handshake?

Or is the MCP2515 simply not suitable for this kind of bus startup state?

I’m not trying to inject anything yet  just trying to observe traffic that I know is happening.

Any pointers on detecting wakeup conditions, sniffing initial handshake, or confirming the actual bus mode would help a lot.

A cost effective and easy solution would be to get a remote control relay and use it to isolate some data and or power to the ECU or other critical module. AliExpress 433mhz remote will work. 

The system itself isn’t “secure” but it is very effective. It’s obscure enough that it will stop every thief dead as they don’t have time to figure it out why the car isn’t working. It also retains all the stock features when the relay is closed.  433mhz has a fairly long range making remote start feasible.

1oupddz,Why is the mechanic going this route? (2010 Genesis Coupe 3.8),"
Update on the 2010 Genesis Coupe 3.8 grand touring I bought (why is the mechanic going this route?)

So the car had low engine oil, engine leaking all over the place and I just officially got confirmed that every cylinder will not get any more than 30 psi the car will turn on.          

But it has basically no power and runs extremely rough. The mechanic told me that he is going to remove the engine timing and engine chain valve cover. (1.4k in labor) says it’s about eight hours of work and they go 175 an hour which is pretty high in my opinion, but whatever.         

But he says the reasons for that is because the chain is really loose and it’s not sitting properly on the guides.          

But I told him that I believed that it did have some kind of engine problem, but not catastrophic and he says that he does send off the parts to be rebuilt so my question why is he going for the timing covers first, instead of just removing the valve covers to see if any of the valves are bent?        

Is the idea because if he can put the timing back into place and then do another compression test and the compression is there, and then he doesn’t have to worry about pulling the heads off to look at the valves.",1,1762904277.0,3,AskMechanics,1762976191,2025-11-11 23:37:57,2025-11-12 19:36:31,"LWschool (Score: 1): The valves are under the camshaft.

You say you don’t think it’s catastrophic but you think it’s bent valves? That would be catastrophic. A very-loose timing chain seems like a fairly good diagnosis to me given the info in this post.

this front corner area is the only visible damage. the diagnostics on the app connected to my car tells me that the indicator, headlight and washer fluid are all damaged - which I can see!

I read that if the cost of the repairs is less than the value of the car that it might be worth fixing from the insurer’s point of view?

The dealer replaced the battery. 3 months later, the same thing, low battery message so the dealer concluded the new battery must have been faulty so they put in a second new battery.



A few more months go by and the same thing. Now, we're getting frustrated. The dealer kept the car for a few days to go a more detailed diagnosis.

At this stage we've had 5 new batteries and now the car is back at the dealer again. They are suggesting some external force could be pinging the car possibly pulling power. Is this even possible?

* Rough idle felt in the body of the truck, not in the steering wheel, intensity varies but it is more noticeable more often now than it is when I got it in May this year. when the rough idle is most severe, it does not go away when in motion.
* check engine is off/on periodically, always with either P0024 or P0014 or both. sometimes it just comes on when driving and goes off when driving, not associated with going over bumps/certain speeds or RPM. sometimes it is not on when i turn the truck off, but it is on the next time i start it and vice versa. it's driven at least every other day.
* valves/sensors on both camshaft banks have been replaced
* full engine has been cleaned and spark plugs replaced
* most recently the mechanic said it might just be how the truck runs and not to worry about it unless the check engine comes on again

I am at the end of my rope with this. The dealership and the independent mechanic both say they can't feel it, except for one time when I was close to the mechanic and brought it in when it was really severe. Even then they said they could ""kind of"" feel it. They won't acknowledge there's a problem unless the check engine is on, which is a crapshoot because the damn thing has a mind of its own.

This truck has run perfectly for one very brief period after the second valve/sensor replacement, so I am not really convinced that this is ""just how it runs"". I've been in all kinds of trucks that have some kind of rumble or heartbeat and this is not that - it's very irregular. It feels like something is out of time, and it gets progressively more out of time until it eventually circles back to being almost in time again, then rinse and repeat.

TLDR irregular rough idle with periodic engine codes P0014, P0024. valves/sensors on cam banks have been replaced, as have spark plugs, and the whole engine has been cleaned.

1. any ideas?
2. one mechanic says this might be how the engine runs - is this as BS as it sounds?

The anxiety gets so bad that I sometimes make myself sick thinking about it — literally to the point of throwing up. I already struggle with anxiety issues in general, but this car thing has been eating away at me nonstop.

Even though I’m working full-time and make $19.50 an hour, I haven’t really been able to save much for another car, so I feel kind of trapped with this one. I just wish I could relax and trust that it’s fine for now.

I don’t even know what to do at this point. Has anyone else gone through something like this? How did you stop worrying every time you got behind the wheel? I just want someone to tell me it’s going to be okay.

1oufcia,Is this myth or fact?,"For as long as I can remember, conventional wisdom concerning a high mileage automatic transmission dictated that unless the transmission fluid has been changed on a regular basis, you should not change the transmission fluid and/or clean the filter if applicable. The myth says that the transmission is operating with all that dirt in there and by removing that dirt the transmission will fail once cleaned.   

I'm 57 years old and I've been hearing about this since I was 10. It dawned on me today that there can't be any proof of this, correct? So what do you think? Is this a myth or a fact? ",105,1762881547.0,70,AskMechanics,1762976191,2025-11-11 17:19:07,2025-11-12 19:36:31,"PckMan (Score: 161): It's a myth.

Automatic transmissions have a thing called the valve body. This is a plate with intricate channels cut into it through which the transmission fluid flows through and it's basically what determines what the transmission does. If you look up what one looks like you'll see that they're quite complicated. The idea is that if there's a transmission that's never had its fluids changed, flushing it may disturb gunk and build up in it which may then make its way through any of the passages in the valve body and clog it, which in turn prevents proper operation of the transmission and leads to damage. The emphasis here is on flushing. In most cases people tell you that a simple fluid change is fine but flushing is what may disturb the gunk, flushing being running fluid through the transmission with a pump with the aim to completely remove dirt and old fluid. If you don't flush the transmission and just change the fluid, it should be fine. Or at least that's the theory.

The reason why this idea doesn't make much sense is that if there really is gunk and dirt in the transmission, you're basically on borrowed time anyways. The fluid in the transmission is under pressure while in operation, so anything a flush may dislodge, regular operation or even a pothole can just as well dislodge. Transmissions are sealed. The only source of dirt or really anything foreign in the transmission are the clutch plates inside them and their internal metallic parts. So the only contaminant that can be introduced into the oil is the dust from the clutch packs or metal shavings. If you're grinding enough metal shavings off of your internals to clog the valve body, the transmission is toast no matter what you do. Clutch pack dust is generally negligible and only really becomes a concern if a clutch pack disintegrates in chunks, due to overheating or a load spike. Another way fluid can degrade is through overheating, and if that's happened enough times to destroy your fluid, the rest of the transmission will soon follow as it has lost its lubrication properties. 

The only other way in which you can get foreign bodies in the transmission to gunk it up is if a seal has failed, and if that's happened, as I said earlier, you're on borrowed time. Whether you change fluids or flush them or don't change them it's only a matter of time before the transmission is destroyed. So basically if a transmission is neglected enough to the point where you're debating whether it's even worth it to attempt to change the fluid, then it's probably not going to make it.

However if a seal has not failed then chances are that the transmission will greatly benefit from a proper flush and fluid change, even if it has been neglected for too long. If the transmission fails after a flush, it would have failed without one too anyways sooner or later.

Honestly it’s old hat and people just needed something to blame.

1ouf5ic,Is a side view mirror glass replacement something I can do myself?,"So a few months back I accidentally hit a wood beam while backing out, which caused the glass to crack pretty badly. I can see fine through it, but I figured it wouldn't pass, however I asked the inspector anyways just in case and he said it is absolutely going to fail because it's on the drivers side.

I just want the glass to be repaired enough so I can pass inspection.

I thought the picture of the mirror posted the first time, but I guess not. But here is what it looks like now.

mtrbiknut (Score: 1): With some mirrors, the glass has a plastic thingy on the back that allows it to snap on another piece easily, on others the whole mirror must be replaced. 

Look in auto parts stored, local junkyards, Amazon, eBay, and especially [rockauto.com](http://rockauto.com) for a replacement. Look for a mirror with the exact same features that yours has such as heat, turn signal, etc. There should be plenty of videos to show you how to switch them out, you will most likely have to remove the trim pad on the inside of the door. They aren't difficult and do not require a lot of tools if you go this route, again there should be videos. The mirrors on these sights may or may not be painted to match your car, you will have to decide how important that is to you. Some of them come with primer that a body shop can match to your car for a (most likely) significant fee. The mirror should have a plug on the end of the wire that plugs directly into the door wire harness so that part is easy. 

This is not a difficult task, just plan for a day when you have extra time for anything that might go wrong like having to run to the parts store. Pick up a tool called a tack remover, it looks like a screwdriver but is forked on the end- it is good to gently pry and to remove clips & pins. You will need a ratchet and most likely a 10mm socket, maybe another socket or two. Maybe a Phillips screwdriver. Take pics as you go so you can see how to put it back together. 

You can do this- good luck!"

1ou1hul,"Is my 2012 Subaru Outback unlucky, or has my mechanic been making mistakes for years?","Hi! I've got a 2012 Subaru Outback I purchased in late 2019 at about 75k miles. When the pandemic hit, I started working from home and have put very few miles on it- right now, it's at around 98k miles. 

Until last year, I haven't needed any repair work besides regular maintenance. 

Last year, a check engine light came on and I took it to a mechanic my family has gone to for years- I'll call them mechanic A. I take my car to mechanic A for routine maintenance, too. I was told the head gasket needed to be completely replaced. My understanding is that this was a common issue in Subarus of this era. I paid to have it replaced in May 2024.

A couple weeks ago (October 2025), I was on the highway when my engine started overheating- lights on the dash, white smoke that smells like maple syrup pouring out of the hood. I immediately try to get off the highway, and end up on an exit ramp when the engine stalls out. 

I have the car towed to the closest auto shop, which is not one I've ever been to before- mechanic B. I explain what happened and also mention that I had the head gasket replaced last year. 

Mechanic B takes a look and replaces the radiator, which was damaged, but says more work will need to be done because the head gasket is damaged. He implies, but does not say with certainty, that the head gasket could have caused the overheat & the replacement was not done correctly.

I call Mechanic A, who says if it was the fault of the head gasket, they'll do the repair for free, but that it's also possible the head gasket was just damaged when the car overheated. Mechanic A implies mechanic B should have known before they replaced the radiator if there were other issues and that they're making a mistake or outright trying to scam me. 

At this point, I don't know who to trust, but I don't have a ton of options, either. Both mechanics are well reviewed, for whatever that's worth.

I have the car towed from Mechanic B to Mechanic A. Mechanic A says the head gasket was damaged by the overheat but didn't cause it. The head gasket is replaced, again. They have my car for over a week, and when it's returned to me, they assure me it's been test driven and everything is good to go.

I have dinner with my parents, who live nearby, and then head home.

When I take my car home, I drive for a couple minutes on side streets and less than 10 minutes on the highway. After exiting the highway, I notice there is white smoke coming out of the hood of my car. Not great plumes or anything, but definitely abnormal. I don't notice a coolant smell. I'm about 5 blocks away from my house, so I pull over, open the hood and blast the heat to cool the engine down. When it's cool, I carefully drive the rest of the way home.

When I get home, I call my parents. There's evidence of leaks where I was parked. It also looks to me like the coolant is low or maybe every completely empty in my car. 

I've lost trust in mechanic A- it seems to me like this should have been caught in test drives, or at the very least, that the leak should have been found. I do not plan on returning to Mechanic A after they correct mistake.

I am a pretty forgiving person, maybe to a fault, and while I'm upset that this happened, I don't want to jump to conclusions. That said, it is hard for me not to question the repair work I had done back in May 2024. 

Am I just really unlucky and something else caused the overheat and damaged the head gasket, or am I right to be suspicious that the repair done last year was botched? 

Is there any excuse for missing the overheating and coolant leak before giving me my car back? If not, how egregious of mistake is this?

Lo mejor sería un **clutch tipo Stage 2**, que ofrece más agarre que el original pero sigue siendo utilizable fuera de la pista. Algunas marcas confiables son **ACT HDSS**, **Exedy Stage 2**, **Clutch Masters FX250 o FX300**, y **Competition Clutch Stage 2**. Eviten los cerámicos de 6 pastillas si todavía lo van a usar en la calle, porque son muy bruscos y cansadores.

Sobre el **volante de inercia**, uno de aluminio funciona, pero puede ser un poco incómodo en tráfico porque el motor sube y baja de rpm muy rápido. Un **volante liviano de acero (chromoly)** suele ser una mejor opción para autos que aún se usan fuera de pista.

También vale la pena revisar el sistema hidráulico (cilindro maestro y esclavo) y cambiar los rodamientos y el líquido del clutch cuando hagan el trabajo.

1otzqew,"Need advice on what to do with my 2011 Nissan Murano – Endurance warranty only paying $2,450 on an $8,700 repair","Hey everyone,
I really need some advice because I’m at a loss right now.

I bought my 2011 Nissan Murano in December 2023 for $3,500 from a family friend. It had been sitting for a bit, so to be safe, I bought an extended warranty through Endurance. The plan was supposed to cover me for 48 months or 48,000 miles (whichever came first), and I’ve been paying $150/month since then.

What I didn’t know was that they capped my car’s total value at $4,750, meaning that’s the maximum they’d ever pay for repairs. I was never told this when I bought the plan.

The issue:
At first, my Murano only hesitated on cold starts — it’d crank once, fail, then start fine the second time. The code showed camshaft sensor bank 1, so I replaced it and the air filter, and it ran great for a while.

A few months ago, it started hesitating again when accelerating. Codes showed camshaft sensors bank 1 and 2, so I called Endurance and took it to Nissan. They diagnosed possible timing chain issues and quoted me $9,000 in repairs (including things like brakes, which I knew I could get cheaper). Endurance said they don’t cover the camshaft sensors, so I had a friend replace them instead, and it ran fine for a while.

Then the transmission problems started:
About six weeks ago, it felt like it wasn’t shifting properly. I checked and topped off the transmission fluid, and it was fine for a couple of weeks. Then I noticed reddish-brown fluid leaks, and last week, the transmission started slipping badly.

I had it towed back to Nissan, and they said it likely needs a new transmission — estimate $8,795. Endurance sent an adjuster and approved the claim… but they’re only paying $2,450 because that’s what they say my car is “worth” now. I’ve already paid them over $3,400 in premiums, plus my original down payment.

Endurance told me:
	•	I can’t drive the vehicle off the lot (or they’ll void the claim).
	•	I can tow it to another shop for a cheaper estimate.
	•	Or I can cancel and get a prorated refund, which they said might only be around $1,000–$1,600 based on mileage and time used.

I’m completely torn.
Do I:
	1.	Tow it home and figure out if another shop can fix it cheaper?
	2.	Take the prorated payout and cut my losses?
	3.	Try to fight Endurance for more coverage since I was never told about the value cap?

If anyone has experience with Nissan transmissions (especially Murano CVTs) or Endurance warranty claims, please share your advice. I don’t even know if the transmission is truly shot — it still ran okay recently.

1otxybc,I think I’m getting scammed. But I also know Im an idiot.,"Before you read this Im 18 with a Chevy Colorado with 78k miles and don’t really know that much. So this morning my tpms system was flashing and I think it reset something because my cruise control stopped working. So I call this shop and told her my cruise control wasn’t working and my tpms system light was flashing, and she tells me they can diagnose it for free. So I pull up and I guess she misheard me when I said cruise control and wrote down my power steering and tps. I wait for an hour and this lady comes back with an ipad and is explaining to me how it’s the 2 wheels in the back that need new sensors and the power steering is fine. Then I said, “what about the cruise control?” Then they look through the notes and realize I meant cruise control and not power steering. So then they go back and I waited another half hour and they brought the ipad back with new notes and said they don’t know what’s wrong with the cruise control, but they found out that all 4 of my tires need new sensors, and they will install it tomorrow for $400. This all sounded weird but I just said, “ok, I’ll be back tomorrow.” On the way home I was looking at the sensors on my screen and only 1 actually needed to be replaced, the other 3 were still reading. Then, I just started hitting buttons and realized Im the biggest idiot in the world, because It’s been such a long time since I did it, because I usually just hit “set” and Im in cruise. The button on the right that turns the cruise control off and on was off. So everything works besides 1 sensor.

1otwdwy,Was i scammed?,"Hey everyone, I need some outside perspective on a used car situation. I'm trying to figure out if this is a clear case of fraud and how strong my small claims case would be.

The Car:

Vehicle: 2008 Pontiac Grand Prix with the 3.8L V6
Mileage: 126,XXX miles
Purchase Price: $3,600 + $100 for a parts to repair intake manifold gasket
The Timeline & The Agreement:

Before Purchase: I knew the 3.8L engine has a common failure point: the intake manifold gasket. I specifically asked the seller about it.
The ""Deal"": The seller (who claims to be a ""36-year Master Tech"") agreed to replace the intake manifold gasket before the sale as long as I paid the final price of $3,700, which included an extra $100 for the parts to do the repair. He showed me pictures of the engine apart as ""proof."" (I’ll attach the photo he sent me)
At Purchase: The car drove fine, and there were no lights on the dashboard. I bought the car on Saturday, November 1st.
What Happened After Purchase:

I drove the car about 260 miles.
The check engine light came on Thursday, November 6th.
I noticed a severe coolant leak. The coolant level dropped from full to 1/4 in those 6 days and turned from blue to a dirty brown color.
The Evidence I've Gathered:

Coolant Leak: I have photos of the low and contaminated coolant.
Check Engine Light Codes: I got a free scan at AutoZone.

Code: P0446 (EVAP Vent Control Circuit)
CRITICAL FINDING: The report says ""Emission Ready = NO."" My understanding is that this status is impossible after 260 miles of driving unless the codes were cleared right before I bought the car, which would hide the CEL. It’s also important to understand that this car cleared an emission test quite literally a month prior (OCT 13 2025) so it’s suspicious to me that it now isn’t emission ready/ now has a check engine light.
Seller's Response: When I confronted him He claimed that ""he disconnected the battery, which caused the lights on the dashboard to reset"" which I find suspicious as the only time he could’ve done so was right before I came to test drive it. Why would he do that unless to hide the check engine light? And why didn’t it come back on until i drove it for another 260 miles.

I messaged him with two choices for a resolution:

A full refund of $3,700 with me returning the car the exact way I bought it.
Or
He provides $1,500 so I can have a professional mechanic fix the issues. This amount is based on estimates for the two known problems: the intake manifold gasket repair (~$1,000-$1,200) and the EVAP system repair (P0446 code) (~$300-$500).
He now refuses these and will only talk if I bring the car back to him for ""inspection,"" which I don't trust him to do. He's calling my well-documented claims a ""Craigslist scam.""
My Core Questions for You:

Mechanically: For the Pontiac 3.8L gurus, does this sound 100% like the classic intake manifold gasket failure? The car runs smooth with no misfires or overheating, just rapid coolant loss and color change. Could it be something else?
Regarding the Codes: Is my interpretation correct? Does ""Emission Ready = NO"" after 260 miles definitively point to the codes being cleared to hide the P0446 code at the time of sale?
Legally / Ethically: Is this fraud? I paid for a repair that failed instantly, and he clearly hid a check engine code. How solid is my case for small claims court to get the $1,500 settled amount to get these repairs done properly?
What's my next move? I'm planning to get a professional mechanic's diagnosis and written report on the coolant leak. Is there anything else I should be doing to protect myself?
Any and all advice would be hugely appreciated. I feel like I've done my homework, but I need some validation because I’m no mechanic far from it and I need the help before I spend money on a mechanic and court fees.

It is part of the system, but only to have somewhere for the pressurized coolant system to be released to as well as recovered from when the system is able to. 

The coolant being a different colour now is probably from coolant not all being drained from the vehicle when the job was done, (not necessary, but I would have done it myself) and then heat cycles exchanging coolant from the overflow. You will have a rad cap either by the intake manifold or by one of the headlights. That’s the actual pressurized coolant system. (DO NOT OPEN IF HOT, you will get burned) If you have just had the coolant in that reservoir change heights it may have been a little underfilled and the overflow has corrected the issue which would show with a lower amount of coolant in it. The vehicle would have come with Dexcool as the coolant which is more of a red/orange colour not blue. So it sounds like he added probably a generic coolant. If it’s not actively dripping you probably don’t have an actual leak. 


As for the EVAP code, it could have been hidden from you, or it could be an unrelated fault. It will be cleared by a battery disconnect and it will only run after a certain amount of drive time, and with fuel between about 20%-80% of a tank."

Now, it usually goes away after a bit but then comes right back within a couple minutes. If you park the truck and sit with the engine running, the light goes away and stays off.

Bit of a rough start to Friday morning was on my way to work at 6am and saw a deer come out of the bushes on the opposite carriageway. I hit the brakes and stopped, but the poor thing kept going and got hit by a van coming the other way… then bounced off sliding down the road and into the front of mine, it was a full size stag, surprisingly, it got up and walked of...

First pic was the only damage that was visible, when it happened, i decided to take the bumper off to mount it back properly, and to establish if what else damaged as when i was driving down the road it didnt feel as lively as it usually does..., the rest of the pics are the unexpected carnage i was met with, the last pic is how it sits now, so real visible damage from outside but obvious substantial damage underneath the bumper cover, the bumper cover itself has only a minor crack, the radiator, is bowed, intercooler has a minor leak and A/C condenser has a hole in it, and loads of broken plastic. Surprisingly no engine lights...

After pricing up the main damaged visible mechanical parts,  getting a rough idea of the cost, to repair myself, i stopped going further, it worked out to be about 4x my insurance excess, without all the undertray plastics and other odds and sods, so I’ve decided to just go through insurance on this one, gutted as its the first claim in 25 years, and I wasnt even moving.

15-20 degrees wouldn't be a 'slight slope'! People tend to seriously overestimate steepness of roads etc, so you're probably doing that. How much height does it gain over the length?

I am seriously considering cancelling my annual roadside assistance subscription. It’s the same story every winter: a dead battery. Just last week, I was stuck for two hours in a supermarket car park waiting for my provider to arrive, simply for a straightforward battery jumpstart. The service time was utterly unacceptable.

This whole situation has forced me to look at my premium versus my actual usage. I pay over £100 a year, but I only ever seem to use the cover for the most minor problems flat tyres and, persistently, flat batteries. Given how slow the response is, I honestly feel like I am completely wasting money.

I’ve started thinking that the smarter financial move might be to purchase a decent portable jump pack and keep the numbers of a couple of trusted local mechanics on speed dial. I suspect they could arrive quicker and the total cost of a few emergency call-outs throughout the year would still be less than my hefty annual subscription.

So, for UK drivers who frequently deal with this issue: What is your strategy? Do you continue to pay for the yearly plan, accepting the slow service simply because it offers that safety net for everything, even if 90% of your usage is just for a [battery jumpstart](https://www.affordablerecovery.co.uk/)?

I've had the car 7 years and would really like to keep it rather than buy a whole new car just for cruise control. 

Would it be possible to replace the wheel controls unit? I'm assuming all the ST variants come with the same internals, but ST-1/ST-2s dont have the cruise control buttons and the ST-3 does.

Should've just bought an ST-3 but just had to take what my local dealership had so I could trade in my old dying car whilst it appeared to be working properly.

1ouaapv,The Bollard Incident,"Hi everyone!

I’m hoping for a bit of advice, and thought someone here would be able to help me out :)

So my mum, as an additional driver on my policy, has reversed into a bollard whilst driving my car. She initially said she thought she “might have just scraped the bumper”, but when I went to have a look it seemed to be a little bit more than just a scrape….

I’ve shopped around for some quotes to repair the damage, and I’ve been quoted £1140 from one garage and £1090 by another. One even said this is “borderline a new quarter panel”. I have absolutely no clue when it comes to things like this, so I have no idea whether this is fair or not.  If it isn’t fair, I’m hoping someone here would be able to tell me! 

I’m reluctant to go through my insurance, as it’s my first policy in my name with me as the named driver, so I’m concerned it will really really affect my future premiums. My mum is not the main driver on any other policy, just an additional driver on mine with about 7 years NCD. 

The voluntary excess on my policy is £100 and the  compulsory for my mum being the driver is £75, so a total excess cost of £175. My policy currently costs about £60 per month.

My car isn’t anything particularly special (to anyone else, to me it is!), it’s a yellow 2010 VW Polo, so I am also a bit worried that if I were to claim this on the insurance they might even write my car off. 

Would anyone be able to give me some advice on what might be the best way forwards?

1ou9dd8,Almost back to her full glory,"My GT-Four has had a troublesome time over the past 18 months.

It was around this time in 2024 that I took the car down to Mook at Skewer to have the Castrol livery refreshed, having just had the nearside rear wheel arch rebuilt and repainted due to a spreading rust problem. On the way down to Mook the turbo gave up the ghost and stopped boosting properly.

Fast forward to March and I finally managed to get the car over to Martin Kingston in Blackburn to have a refurbished hybrid turbo fitted in replacement. Got it back home, and about a week later the car started throwing all kinds of warning lights and limp mode behaviours at me... which Martin told me were the signs of an ECU failure due to capacitor leakage etc.

Jump forward in time again to May, and I rip the ECU out and send it off to GT4-Play to have the ECU repaired. A week or two later, it's back in my hands and shortly after, back in the car.

It's then I noticed that the offside riser block on the rear wing was essentially detached from the car, and had completely collapsed structurally. Never rains but it pours.

OEM risers are basically impossible to find these days, so I had to buy a pair of replica riser blocks from Latvia, then get them painted and try and attach everything. But, when I was removing the rear wing and the existing risers, it revealed a _lot_ of the black adhesive (Tigerseal?) underneath that just wouldn't come off, so I gave the job to the same body shop that took care of the wheel arch rust repair at the start of this story.

Right now I know of only two ways to fix. 

Bend over and fork out for a new immensely expensive light unit. 

Or the scary option. Take your headlight unit out and put it in a warm oven for about 10 minutes so it melts the glue holding the outer lens cover. Then gently prize it off to clean it out.

The idea is that mismatched tyres will behave differently, e.g. if you brake hard the car will pull towards the direction of the tyre with better grip. You could do an emergency stop on a quiet road and see if it actually does that, I expect it won't really.

They do need to be the same size, by law, but yours all are.

If they’re all the same type of tyre (not mixing summer and winter tyres) then I’d say leave it. If they’re a mix of summer and winter tyres, then replace them so they’re all matching. Mixing summer and winter tyres isn’t illegal, but it is unsafe. You’d have really unpredictable handling in emergency situations. 

The different weight ratings don’t really matter too much. That’s more of a comfort thing. As long as the weight rating is the same or higher than what the car is supposed to have, it’s fine. Having a higher weight rating than what the manufacturer recommended will just give you a harsher ride.

In April some SUV bad boys inhaling balloons crashed into the offside rear wing whilst turning a corner; I was sitting in the parked car at the time. They didn't stop, I caught them up, they pretended they didn't speak English. Went to insurance and police, useless. Registered keeper didn't bother responding to two requests for naming the driver. The police prosecuted the keeper and they were fined £660 plus £364 costs and six penalty points. They didn't bother to turn up in court so I wonder if the registered keeper is even a real person.

In August, some numpty keyed the nearside door and rear wing. I opened a police report but it was closed next day. Yesterday morning I went outside and keyed again, this time offside door and front wing. Pics at https://postimg.cc/gallery/Qj2snrz, not that easy to photograph in wet weather.

I don't have any enemies that I know of. I live in a decent part of London although in our immediate road or two it can occasionally get a little sketchy (near the tube, anti-social behaviour, drug / alcohol / homeless etc). The car is parked on the street at night.

A few weeks ago a neighbour left a note saying he'd noticed my car had been keyed and his had too and did I know anything; he lives in a flat in another block and has a generic SUV, no more an obvious keying target than mine.

I have some rubbing compound, T-Cut scratch remover, and polish. Should I try this before I do anything else to see if it improves matters? The first key was deeper, I can really feel it with my nail, the second key is not as deep but I can still (just) feel it with my nail.

Is trying to touch it up myself a waste of time? I'm more comfortable with mechanical stuff, and it's a dark metallic colour going across panels. I'd like to have a go but I'm worried about making a  mess of it.

I sent photos to Chips Away, they said too much for us to deal with, take it to a body shop.

Should I consider involving the insurance company again? I claimed for the SUV damage in April. I'm not sure if my current policy covers vandalism but I can check. I have an £800 total excess but perhaps to get it all painted properly that would be a relatively okay price to pay?

If I do deal with the damage in whichever way, I won't want to park the car here again just in case someone really hates Boxsters or me, I'd just put it up for sale and garage it somewhere.

I think it might be dashcam time, although I'm not sure what the chances are that it will help in practice, and I don't drive every day so I'd be concerned about the car battery.

webuyanycar offered £3735 without declaring scratches so I can't imagine how low they'll go in person. I bought it for under 6K 2.5 years ago and pre-keying thought I could get that back in Feb / March when people want these. My local indy said their values have gone up and I might get 10K although that sounds like pie in the sky.

I have time because it's the worst time of year to sell this type of car. I'd be ""happy"" to drive it through winter and get it done in time to put up for sale in March.

Sad joke; I have an E93 M3 SORNed in a lock up which I was going to start using once the Boxster was sold, but given this experience, I think I'm better off selling that as well and buying a large shitbox with an MOT. I can't see myself parking the M3 on the street. And yet there are plenty of high value cars parked around, much newer than mine and worth more.

I would like a good price for what is fundamentally a good car, without ""investing"" crazy money. I'm prepared to drive around to the right place(s) if there is anyone who can do a good enough job without insisting on painting the entire side of the car and charging four figures.

Respraying the pannels would give the best results, however you might want to consider a cheaper option, depending on how much time you are willing to invest.

I would start with a localised and heavy cut compound on a random dual action polisher.
