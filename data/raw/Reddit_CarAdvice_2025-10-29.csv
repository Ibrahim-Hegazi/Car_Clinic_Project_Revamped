 you need a small squeeze tube of Silicone dielectric tune up grease..  just enough to wipe inside the boot. but not so much it gets on the metal parts.  this keeps the high voltage from leaking between the boot and the spark plug or coil tower..

1oipi6z,I need advice from a professional,"I have a Mini One R56 from 2008.

I installed aftermarket LED side indicators on my car, and they only work properly when the engine is off. When the engine is running, they either flicker or stop working.

I'm installing an AEM methanol injection kit to my car. I've hooked up all the wires already but the kit seems to constantly be at full spray with ignition on. The kit has an ARM wire to tell the kit when it's allowed to spray, which should only be when the engine is running and at a set boost pressure. Its required to tap this wire into a fuse that has +12V ONLY with ignition on, and 0V with ignition off. I checked every fuse and none of them read 0v when key is ON but ignition is OFF, they all read 0.3-0.4V . I tapped mine into one that has all those requirements except it reads 0.4volts with key ON ignition OFF.

Is it safe to drive - not really. Not for daily commuter driving - if the joints are clicking, they've been ran dry, and they could just break - and you'd lose all drive to the wheels (the right wheel wouldn't work either, since there's a differential).


Could your father in law fix it - possible. But they can be a beast to maneuver out, and if an axle seal is broken or split in the process, then you're going to have a leaking transmission and a new problem. 


The good news is though, replacement axles aren't too expensive, and for a qualified mechanic, shouldn't take too long.

1oio5lk,Why do my batteries keep dying?,"2010 Chevrolet Silverado, 5.3l engine.

5 years ago, I replaced the battery for the first time since I bought the truck (it was about 6 years old at that time).  3 years ago, the battery I had in it tested bad, so I replaced it, barely in warranty.  Last year, I replaced it again, barely out of warranty.  Today, I had to pull it out again as it's currently testing 2 volts.  

The cables seem good, fuses are fine, and batteries, whether from the same store or a different one keep working 5+ years in my Subaru, so I know it's something with the truck, but I don't know what.

The truck's battery gauge keeps showing good voltage right up until the batteries die, no warning, so I don't think I have a parasitic draw (could be wrong though), but at this point, I'm wondering if I'm getting a run of bad batteries, or if there's something I can look at that may be causing this to happen suddenly?

1oinkey,Leak near starter/bellhousing only when engine runs (ATF?),"Hey guys — chasing a weird leak I can’t pin down. Hoping someone’s seen this before 👇

Truck: 2016 F-150 2.7L EcoBoost, 4WD

What’s happening:
	•	Leak starts about 10–15 seconds after startup (nothing under cold pressure test)
	•	Fluid looks reddish/oily, not watery — feels like ATF
	•	Steady drip coming from starter/bellhousing area
	•	Looks like it’s seeping from the torque-converter inspection hole or right above it
	•	Cleaned everything after a coolant hose repair, and this new leak came back right after starting the truck

What I’ve done so far:
	•	Replaced heater hose clamp that was leaking coolant
	•	Cleaned the bellhousing, starter, and surrounding area
	•	Cold-pressure tested the cooling system — no coolant leaks
	•	Checked cooler lines — no visible leaks under idle
	•	Leak only happens once the engine is running

Thinking maybe the front pump seal / torque-converter seal on the transmission? Just want to make sure I’m not missing something like cooler-line O-rings or front-case leak before I start planning to drop the trans.

One cable should move when you move the shifter forward and back, the other for side to side. If the side to side cable is disconnected at the transmission look to see if the bushing is damaged. If it isn't moving at all disassemble the plastics around your shifter and inspect. If it's all connected and moving you probably have a broken cable.

 Now worst case scenario is the cable is connected and everything is moving as it should. In that case take it in, your transmission is coming out.

Yes, I know. I knooowwwww. I will never do any girl things ever again to my car other than clean it. Amen.

I expected it was going to be expensive. I don't know what the shop put in my car but it never worked. When I picked up the car the first time, immediately it was jerking like there was a power struggle between my AC and the engine? (I'm sorry, I know nothing about cars.) And the AC didn't work completely. It kept shutting off. In the hottest time of Texas summer. I pick up my boyfriend from work, we go straight back. They do a diagnostic review of the work they just did, and charge me $150. Confused and upset, I go home.

After I talk with management, they take the car back, refund my $150, they find faulty parts, they do something to it- I'm guessing replace whatever wasn't working, and I pick the car up again. This time it works but it only works if the temperature outside is about 90 or lower. When it gets hot, the AC struggles and shuts off all over again.

I take it back to the shop aaagaaaiinnn and the weather isn't hot enough and they can't repeat the experiment I'm experiencing. Meanwhile my boyfriend and I are paying 20 bucks a day for ubers anywhere. Nothing is done to the car and I go get it, because I already had a vacation planned and I needed the car.

I didn't (and still don't) want to go back and have to tell these people again that the AC won't work when it's hot outside. They can't seem to figure this out. I dispute the charge with my credit card with as much evidence as I can- they write a letter stating that the repair was done correctly. I lose. I have documentation that I am dissatisfied but I guess none proving it doesn't work. 

Do I go back to them? Do I go to another shop and get them to look at my AC and get their documentation? Do I go to Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation? Is there anything I can do to get a working AC OR get that money back so I can get it fixed elsewhere?

These symptoms lead me to believe I might have a seized caliper or a faulty brake booster. I just bought the car 3 weeks ago and it was driving fine, so I haven’t checked the brakes, but it might be that the brake pads are worn down and causing the caliper to overheat and seize.

I filled the reservoir with DOT 4 to start the bleed, but here’s the problem:
when I press the clutch pedal, the clutch fork doesn’t move at all.
Not even a little. The slave piston doesn’t extend or moves, and there’s zero pedal pressure.

Here’s what I know and have tried:

	•	Master, line, and slave are all brand-new and bone-dry (not pre-filled).

	•	Reservoir is full, no visible leaks.

	•	Tried gravity bleeding and traditional pump-and-hold bleeding — fluid does drain and air comes out, but the fork still doesn’t move and pressure doesn’t build.

	•	I’ve seen plenty of 350Z/G35 videos where the fork moves right when starting the bleeding process by pressing the clutch pedal but mines for some reason doesn’t move, with the same setup and all but mine just refuses entirely

I doubt the fork or pivot ball is seized since before getting everything out for the replacement I had pressure and was able to drive the car to where it currently is.

Any ideas why the fork wouldn’t move at all even with everything hooked up and fluid in the reservoir?

Shouldn’t I at least see a tiny bit of motion, even if there’s still air in the system?

When your Q5 won’t rev past around 2000 RPM, feels sluggish, and systems like Auto Start/Stop or cruise control stop working, that’s Audi’s way of protecting the engine or transmission from potential damage. Limp mode limits power so you can drive safely without causing more problems.

Since it only happens sometimes, it’s probably a smaller issue like a bad sensor, low voltage, or a pressure problem rather than something major. Start by scanning the car for codes even if the check engine light isn’t on. A full system scanner, such as a YOUCANIC, which works great on Audi, but you can also use Autel, or Launch, can read codes from the engine, transmission, and turbo modules.

Next, have the battery and alternator tested. Weak voltage often triggers random system shutoffs on Audis, especially the Start/Stop unavailable message. If the issue happens more when accelerating or under load, it could be something with the turbo system like a bad boost sensor or a small vacuum leak.

Basically, the car is protecting itself because something isn’t working right. Getting a proper scan will tell you whether it’s an electrical issue, a sensor, or something mechanical starting to fail.

1oih76g,Bad Winch Spot?,"Crossposting this with the towing sub for some advice as I’m pretty worried about this. Post is as follows:

Hi all. I have a question about a tow I got done today and I’m concerned about how the driver winched my car onto his flatbed.

I was getting my G37 coupe towed to a shop for some engine work and called CAA (Canadian AAA) and they sent a flatbed to my house. Once we pushed the car out of the driveway the driver insisted that he does not winch via the tow eye but instead from “under the car” as he claimed it was safer. I was inside the car while he was hooking it up making sure the wheels were straight and the car was lined up with the flatbed so I didn’t see what he was attaching his J hooks onto.

He asked me to step out and began winching the car onto the tilted flatbed which is when i realized he had hooked the 2 J hooks onto the INNER TIE RODS. I understand steering components can take a beating but surely not the weight of a 3600 pound car being pulled up a 30 degree incline. I protested, yet he continued winching it up as it was “all good”. My car is at the shop now but from what little research I’ve done, I’ve learned that this could be potentially very bad for the tie rods and especially the steering rack. I can’t drive the car, nor can the shop until the engine is fixed. I called CAA and they said I can’t file a damage report until the car is confirmed to have damage.

How bad is this? Have you see it done before with no ill effects? Any input is greatly appreciated. TIA!",2,1761675823.0,12,MechanicAdvice,1761766681,2025-10-28 18:23:43,2025-10-29 19:38:01,"patricksb (Score: 3): Hooking tie rods is a well known hazard when blindly reaching under a car with J hooks trying to grab the lower control arm. It's never intentional. The most likely damage if there were any would be a bent tie rod- they're pretty thin. Even if no damage is visible, it'll show up in an alignment in the toe. The vehicle was winched up in neutral, right? Was the winch used for securement, or was the car secured with straps around the wheels?

FWIW, I'll never ever trust a factory tow eye, and you shouldn't either. I'll go to the frame/ subframe/ factory tow points every time (They're actually on a tab that sticks down from the subframe on your car- super easy!).

Top-Adagio-7870 (Score: 2): Yeah that’s definitely not the right way to winch a car up a flatbed. The inner tie rods are part of your steering system and are designed to handle side-to-side steering forces, not thousands of pounds of pulling tension. Using them as anchor points can bend the rods, tweak the rack, or even stress the seals inside the steering rack housing. On a G37 especially, that’s not a cheap fix."

First, check the battery voltage when the car is off or in the accessory mode. The voltage should be higher than 12.5v

Assuming you can start it, check the voltage at the red and black terminals of the battery. If they read 14V while the car is running, the alternator is fine.

If the voltages are okay, then it points to a starter problem. But, if you simply replace the starter, and that doesn't fix it, the problem may be deeper than the starter (ignition switch, relays, etc, etc)."

About 6 weeks ago, I had the BCM reprogrammed. And about 2 weeks ago I had the number 1 cylinder coil, starter and battery replaced due to a flashing engine light. About $3500 worth of work total. 

Right after the cylinder coil repair, the engine noise got progressively worse, eventually sounding like metal in the engine.  As the noise got worse, the car lost power and is now undriveable. 

Any thoughts on what happened or if it could be related at all to the work that was done?

1oidm7b,"2020 Nissan Armada, Possible bad brake booster?","I have a 2020 Armada with about 85k miles, had it for just over two years.  Since I got it, when you step on the brakes you hear a hissing from the brake pedal for a second or two, then stops, seems to be worse in the morning for whatever reason.  Also, I feel like the brake pedal goes a little farther to the floor than it should, but it doesn't always do that.  And bonus points for me thinking that maybe the engine is idling a little too high, anywhere between 750-900 rpm, but I don't know what's supposed to be normal for this engine.  (5.6L V8). Which might confirm an air leak in the booster...

Everything points to a bad brake booster, but I just want to ask some people to help me confirm my thoughts on this.  This morning I sat in the driveway with it running pressing the pedal to get a better idea what it's doing:

\- When you press it, goes down kinda far, not to the floor though, and hisses for a second or two then stops.   Then if you hold it you can actually feel the pedal come back up against your foot, as if the leak stopped and is building vacuum back up making the pedal hard again and up higher in the travel.

\- If you let off the pedal then push it right away, it won't hiss and \*sometimes\* the pedal won't travel as far to the floor

\- if you let off the pedal and wait a few seconds to push is again, then it hisses and does the same as above again.

Again, I think it's a bad brake booster, but just want to get other opinions, and maybe some other ideas I can do to diagnose it further to confirm my suspicions.  And, if anyone has done a booster job on a 2020 Armada and can comment on how easy/hard the job is, that would be appreciated as well.

1oic5bb,I think my mechanic misdiagnosed my problem and is now trying to charge me twice - what’s a reasonable stance here?,"I am UK based. I have a 2012 Ford Focus with 80,000 miles on the clock. One previous owner and a full service history. 

On 23rd September the car was being driven on residential roads when a warning came up ‘engine over heating, pull over when safe’. A red check engine light came on and the engine cut. It was parked safely and with the help of roadside assistance on the phone we established that the coolant level was empty. I topped it up with water and drove it to my local garage without further issue. 

The garage diagnosed a water pump failure and performed the work at a cost of £700 on 6th October. I picked up the car and drove it on fairly local drives (no more than 45 mins) for 2 weeks when the same over heating issue happened again on 23rd October. When I checked the coolant was once again empty and required 2L of water to get it back to an appropriate level. I took it back to the same garage who took it for a test drive and examined it again. They could find nothing wrong and said it was an air lock in the coolant after it was replaced. They said they had checked the pressure system of the car and coolant system and it was fine. I picked the car up on 24th October. 

Three days later (27th October), the same issue occurred once again. We had been driving for 20 minutes when the same warning came up and when we checked the coolant was once again empty. I topped it up with 2L of water once again. I returned the car to the garage and they have now called to say the valves which keep the coolant in place have failed and the coolant has been leaking into the footwell of the car which is why it was missed previously. They have quoted me £65 for parts and £825 for labour as the whole dash will need to be removed. 

On the phone I challenged them that it didn’t sound as it the original repair was needed by they insist that it was. I’m unsure how to prove this considering that the supposedly faulty part has been replaced and disposed of. But I feel that I left my car with them in good faith to diagnose the problem and repair it and returning twice within 3 weeks with the same issue indicates that the original repair was not appropriate or adequate. What is reasonable in terms of payment? I feel it’s reasonable that I pay for the actual issue that’s wrong with the car, but not for the original work that I believe was incorrect. 

Does this sound reasonable? I would appreciate the mechanical input to know if the first repair does indeed sound unreasonable? 

I’ve always been fair to this garage, been loyal, left good reviews online, and when their apprentice accidentally ripped my car door off and it needed replacing and a longer stay I was completely understanding but this doesn’t fair back.

1. a very small whistling noise while driving in first gear, but barely noticeable.

2. when turning the key (already warm engine after shopping groceries) the car needed a bit longer than usual to start - maybe 3 seconds more, which is unusual. This only happened once.

I thought this might be due to the oil change and fresh oil, and did not care about it any further as I was very busy that weekend.

After driving 30 km, we drove uphill on the highway in 5th gear and suddenly the engine lost a lot of power and started shaking. We stopped the car directly and got towed to an official Toyota garage

Diagnose: Cylinder 3, only around 5 PSI compression, Cylinder 4 around 40 PSI (125 PSI is normal). 

The car was consuming around 1l oil / 500-1000km before, but this never changed in the last years and did not get worse, so not a thing that happened recently.

These ZZ engines were legendary for their oil consumption: once you get past 500ml/1.000km oil consumption it's always time to open the engine. Failure to do so will result in a much heavier bill down the road.

Like many Japanese engines from those years the ZZ family suffers from a very poor design of the piston rings and oil drain holes in the pistons themselves. This will cause the piston rings to progressively ""freeze"" inside the piston groves. If ignored for long enough the piston will develop enough horizontal play to slowly but surely polish the cylinder lining to the dreaded ""mirror finish"". 

Best case scenario: the engine goes from using a lot of oil to using an absolutely obscene amount of oil. I have personally seen one of these engines use 2 liters of oil/500km. Worst case scenario: the engine lose compression on one or two pistons and first feel very down on power and then stops working.

1oi97rj,Truck ac issue/troubleshoot,I’m trying to research an issue I’m having with my trucks AC. I believe there is a leak somewhere and am wondering if I’m on the right track to finding it. I want to say it’s the evaporator coil behind the firewall. I say this because before I lost my cold ac and air flow I was getting the smell of Freon. I’ve also seen that Freon doesn’t have a smell and that it could be something with radiator coolant but I don’t have any issues there and it distinctly smelled like Freon from when I first worked on an ac leak on this truck (replaced the shader valves on hi and low side). Also my air flow seems to be hindered especially in hotter parts of the day and I still get a heavy condensation drip from the truck. So my thought is the coil is freezing up due to low Freon and suffocating the air flow and the Freon smell I got was from the leak being in the coil itself being blown through my system.

What you can do is fill a bottle with soapy water just use dawn dish soap and water. Then fill the tire to the max pressure listed on the sidewall. Spray this mixture all along the rim of the tire and watch to see if anything bubbles up.

Maybe you've got a small crack in the rim? Or the valve stem has a leak? I'd try a different tire shop.

Just go it and say you've got a slow leak in a tire and you aren't sure if it's the rim or the tire that's causing the issue.

Alternatively if you've got someone handy in your life (or you'd like to try and learn) you can take a spray bottle, fill it with soap and water and give the tire a good spraying! If their is a leak you'll be able to see little bubbles forming.

Can also raise the tire psi to like 40psi so the bubbles are easier to find.. just don't leave that much air in the tire and drive on it."

1oi9y21,Overwhelmed with car accident,"Hello everyone,

As you can tell from the title, I’m a bit overwhelmed by an accident that happened to me this morning.

If this isn’t the right subreddit for this kind of post, I’d also appreciate a pointer to a more suitable one :)

Here’s what happened to my mum and me:

My mum was driving my car this morning to the TÜV (vehicle inspection) follow-up appointment. The car is registered in her name, and I wasn’t driving because I’m currently sick. Not even 30 meters after she started driving, another car came from the left and crashed into her — a clear violation of the “right before left” rule by the other driver.

We have the other driver’s name, address, and phone number. The car he was driving is registered to his father, since he (the driver) was just coming home from a night shift. I also texted him to let him know that I urgently need a rental car starting Friday for university and work.

We’ve already informed our insurance company that there’s been an accident. My big worry is that my car might be a total economic loss (“wirtschaftlicher Totalschaden”), since I currently can’t afford a new one. On top of that, I just spent €1,100 last week on repairs to get it through the TÜV.

My question is: What else should I do to make sure I get the maximum compensation possible / what can the other party or their insurance do in this situation? My car is a Honda Jazz from 2006 which I purchased about 2 years ago. You cannot open the front door completely through the accident

Anyways two of the lug nuts were on REALLLY tight, and I managed to slightly loosen one of them, but it was still FAR FAR tighter on than the rest, except for one.

1oiiamy,2008 Subaru Outback 2.5L L.L. Bean Won't start,"(Cross posted because I need all the help I can get!)
Ok, I'm at my wits end with this. I'll try to keep the issue and what has been done so far to fix it succinct, but GODDAMMIT I've tried everything I've researched and did the repairs a mechanic diagnosed, and it still won't start! 

2008 Subaru Outback 2.5L AWD LL Bean edition. 226k miles. I've owned it for about 18 months. 

The check engine light came on about 2 months into owning it. Got the codes checked: Catalytic converter and oxygen sensors. I've felt with that before and while it's not good for the environment, I've never had a car stop working because of our, so I let it go because I'm poor. 

In May or so of this year, it stopped cranking reliably. We world start it in the morning, drive it, park, them when we went to start it again, it would just chug and not start. After waiting for 20 min or so and trying it a few more times, or would eventually start. This became more and more frequent. 

In August, it stopped cranking completely. It will just chug and chug like it wants to, but can't. 

I did a TON of Internet searches trying to figure out what was wrong. Here are the fixes we've tried that have not resulted in any repair: 

New spark plugs
New spark plug wires
New fuel pump 

I finally had a mobile mechanic come out and he diagnosed a burnt out catalytic converter and bad battery working harness. I ordered the parts so he could repair it, but then the company he works for decided where I live is ""outside their operating area"" and stopped allowing me to make an appointment. I tried texting him multiple times at his private number and he ghosted me. 

After failing to find another mobile mechanic to come fix it, I watched a bunch of YouTube videos on how to replace the catalytic converter and just did it myself. I also replaced the battery cables with a direct fit harness from Subaru rather than trying to splice generic cables together. I replaced the battery because when the cables were home up, it was DEAD.

Here's where it gets weird and I'm needing help.

I got the cat out of the car on Saturday, not needed another tool to remove the plugs in the holes for the O2 sensors, but got someone to bring me to AutoZone with my old battery and get a new one. I hooked up the new battery and decided to see if it would start without the cat installed. It took a couple tries, but IT STARTED! It sounded like a demon from hell and smelled awful, but it started! 

I just finished insisting the brand new catalytic converter, hooked up the O2 sensors... And nothing!!! It won't crank, and I'm at the limit of my ability to figure it out!

The fact that it DID crank without the cat installed makes me think it's an air intake issue, that it's not getting enough air to start the engine, not I don't know what that means as far as what party to replace to get it to start.

PLEASE HELP!!! I need my car back before Thanksgiving! ",1,1761678310.0,11,CarHelp,1761766681,2025-10-28 19:05:10,2025-10-29 19:38:01,"Audiofyl1 (Score: 1): Having a no crank and a crank no start are significant different. 

No crank is battery, starter, wiring as the major potential issues. There could be other things as well.

Neither one will likely be caused by a poorly functioning cat converter.

The VSA is the stability control and that also likely uses the ABS system to determine wheel slip. With the ABS system not happy, it causes other systems that rely on it to also not function correctly.
Take the car to get it scanned, you can do this at most parts stores if they can scan ABS codes or a shop for (usually) around $100 and find out what the computer thinks is wrong. Then you can order the part and get it fixed. Often its as simple as remove the wheel, use a 10mm socket to remove the ABS sensor, replace it. If you live in a high rust area, like midwest/north east coast. You will probably want to pay a mechanic to suffer through the rust and any broken bolts so you don’t have to. Once its fixed, your car will be good to go.

The ABS system probably doesn’t actually work right now. The brakes still work, but the anti-skid is not. Under normal driving conditions this won’t affect your driving but you’re more likely to end up in a crash should you need to do an emergency stop because the system is not functioning. Nor will stability control help if you are in a slide. Nor will the tpms be able to alert you if your tire goes flat. 

The lights aren’t just there for fun, the do actually mean something. And it means the driver aids are not present to assist in an emergency.

1oih8jj,"2007 Hyundai Sonata - Starter was replaced with a re-manufactured starter, and now the plug from the ignition to starter has melted - why?","Hello all,

Not sure if someone could advise why this would happen, but I have a 2007 Hyundai Sonata and the starter went bad about three weeks ago, so two and a half weeks ago I had it replaced at a mechanic with a re-manufactured one they purchased and installed. I replaced the battery before that with a new one because the starter sounded slow and labored when turning the ignition, and then the battery tested bad, so I assumed that was the lone issue - but it turned out to be the starter and everything was fine since it was replaced.

Fast forward to today, and I was at the store and noticed the ignition wasn't starting, no clicking, no attempted start, nothing. And then a moment later, I try again and it starts. Get back home and attempt again - nothing. A few tries later it starts like nothing happened. So I take it to the mechanic and they look from under and comment the starter is extremely hot (not sure if that's normal) but that the plug from the ignition to the starter is now melted. I asked if it was like that when I had the starter replaced before and they said no and the plug was in perfect condition.

I left my car there and they're going to try to put a new starter in tomorrow and I'm assuming maybe replace the plug. The guy said he didn't know if it was something with the ignition or starter, but pointed out if it was the ignition previously then it would have melted the plug previously (and didn't).

I'm a computer guy, not a car guy, so don't know a lot - but my theory is something is causing the starter to pull more voltage and I don't know if it could be something with the re-manufactured starter being different than the original somehow or what, but that's just a wild uninformed guess. Anyone have any ideas why this would occur and if it's as simple as a bad re-manufactured starter being put in, or is it something possibly being overlooked by the mechanic?

1oif5e6,How come my tire keeps deflating,"Long story short, I am no longer with my ex. He’s manipulative and violent, a genuine threat to me. I blocked him on every single platform but he’s obsessed with me and there is something that keeps happening to my tire since we broke up. 

A week after the break up, I found my tire completely flat. I put some air back in it and brought it to the mechanic to have all my winter tires installed, since it’s about time anyway. I got a brand new set of winter tires. 
However, a week after the installation of the new ones, my tire was once again flat. Once more, I blew some air back in it at the gas station and 5 days later, the tire was deflated *again* (not enough to have the signal on my dashboard tho). I have booked an appointment to have it checked but In the meantime, I am really stressed and scared that he’s the one compulsively deflating my tire. I never had a flat tire in my life, but since I have my new (used) car it’s happened 3 times in 3 weeks ??

My question is : Is there anyway the rim or the mags that I have can be the reason why my tire keeps deflating? I have a new (but previously owned and used) ford escape 2012. Please help me, I am worried and know nothing about mechanics. I am genuinely worried he’s the one doing this because I know it’s something he would do, but I don’t wanna believe it.

I called my insurance agent, and she basically discouraged me from filing a claim, not in so many words, but she said that it it’s going to be a collision and my insurance will go up.

I have a $500 deductible.

My oil pressure light popped on the other day for like a few seconds then went off and didn't come back on for the rest of the day. Got scared and checked the oil, the level was fine. I figured maybe it was because I was on a steep downward incline when it went off that it just got an airbubble or something.

Couple days later I decided to go ahead and change out the oil and filter out early (It was about 65% through it's life) just in case. Saw no signs of obvious leaks. And the amount that drained was certainly around the right amount.

Day later it did the same thing. Noticed it was when I was at low speed. Again it was only for a couple seconds then went out. Few miles down the road it did it again after getting off of the highway into the suburbs. Checked the oil level and again, it was perfectly fine.

Am I looking at the sensor going out, the pump going out, or something a lot worse? I figure a sensor I could change myself but anything past that I'd take it in to a shop.

It would be possible there's other underlying issues, maybe a bad shared ground, or the vehicle requires some sort of repair but without proper diagnosis guessing will rarely get you anywhere and swapping parts blindly just ends up costing money. You could look at misfire monitors for actively misfiring cylinders but it wouldn't be my first choice knowing these vehicles from working on them at the dealer. Here's what I would do first. 

I'd get the battery charged properly on a charger, load test it then follow with your diagnosis if it passes, bad voltages causes many modules to report faults that aren't there in its low voltage operation confusion. Also fly by wire throttle bodies like in your car hate having something off. Many won't relearn automatically if they're dirty especially after losing power. So while you're digging I'd get a can of throttle body cleaner and inspect the throttle plate for proper movement and being clean. I'd bet as you start spraying, carbon will run out with the fluid. Especially with the model year of your vehicle. 

If the faults are still there then further diag will be required and more often than not faults are not directly caused by sensors but external factors like a dirty, sticky throttle plate, it will 100% cause abs/stability codes along with a powertrain code as they're all working together. 
The tires spin, the wheel speed sensors report this to your abs module, the brakes now pulse to reduce wheel spin along with a message to the engine computer to reduce the throttle plate opening to further reduce power to help slow down said wheel. See how the two systems aren't related but for certain tasks are. I doubt your friend broke anything, either something surfaced while he had it or my suspicion of a faulty battery could have thrown the car for a loop as for a moment, many systems are actively working and are pulling power (the abs pump/module does draw a decent amount power while being operated) possibly causing a temporary unusually low system voltage (flagging the systems that were actively working on something important) from taxing an already compromised battery, and hasn't had enough proper fault free drive cycles to clear the faults stored in the computers.

Lastly, alternators produce power to maintain accessories and slowly replenish a battery that just had some draw taken from it during events such as cranking. It isn't meant to charge a dead battery, it'll wear it out in no time. It's especially bad if it's constantly trying to maintain a defective battery. The price of an alternator outweighs the price of a battery, an alternator will also leave you stranded if it decides to finally let go so the longer you can make it last the better it is for you. 

I could be wrong about the battery, but from experience it wouldn't be a first or unusual symptoms for one of these. 

Good luck."

The ECU has been replaced. When that happened they had to marry the immobilizer unit to the vin in the new ( well probably used) ECU or the car wouldn't run.

To change the vin of the ECU requires flashing. It's more complex than just scanner stuff.

That said your other option is to order an ECU from somewhere like flagship one. It will come with the VIN you give them.

It could be swapped in but will again have to be married to the immo.

1ohwwgj,External Oil leak from head? Is this even possible?,"I recently bought a 2013 Chevy Sonic lt 1.6 (only produced in Mexico) with an oil leak. No codes, engine runs fine (as far as I could tell). First thing I did was change the timing belt, seals (they were leaking) and tensioner, change the oil, flush the coolant. This helped but the leak persisted. I then changed the valve cover gasket, which looked wet/weeping. The pan is dry. The leak was now less but still there. I checked the plugs and they looked ok: no steam-clean appearance, no soaked look, etc. I changed them anyway.

Next, I took the car to a real mechanic who diagnosed leaking oil cooler gaskets, and I left the car with him. A few hours later, he calls to tell me that the oil cooler gaskets are fine but that the leak is from the cylinder head, most likely due to a previously poorly done resurfacing. He told me to monitor it and did not charge me for the inspection. He has a very good reputation as a professional, honest technician. But I do not think he actually removed the head to inspect it because it would have been a pretty involved procedure, right? The car runs fine, no codes, no white smoke out the exhaust.

So my questions are: how could he be sure? What, if anything, should I do? I really want to avoid replacing the head if at all possible. OTOH, it has only 113,500 kms on it and is in very good shape.

It could be a warped head, a warped block, a bad head gasket, or poor previous work. Without taking it apart, you aren't gonna know. 

The correct fix would be to have a new head gasket on hand, as well as a quote and a source for a new head just in case. Take it apart, measure everything, and send the block out to get resurfaced. Replace all TTY fasteners, head gasket, and the head (if it was warped).

1oiffch,Creating a driving simulator,"I work in a medical research facility and we do a lot of driving and drug interaction studies; like testing the impairment of marijuana or alcohol on driving. Our ""driving simulator"" has been a plastic steering wheel and pedals, which works for very basic testing. But with a recent grant, we have the opportunity to build a full scale driving simulator, using the front half of a car.

The chassis will have the engine and transmission removed, along with the suspension and SRS system, etc, but we hope to keep everything else in place such as dashboard and controls, seat belts, etc. The back half of the car would be removed. We'd probably power the electronics with a 12v adapter (a very large one) to take the place of the battery.

A few questions:

1) Is it possible to control the dashboard functions like the speedometer through the ODB2 port? I imagine this might be possible, but only with specific vehicles.

2) Is it also possible to get live data through OBD2 from the steering position sensor, accelerator position, or brake position sensor? We can attach our own position sensors, but reusing an existing sensor would be much easier.

3) Without an engine, transmission, or SRS, how can we keep the car's key in the 'On' position, but also keep the computer happy so it doesn't flash the check engine light, airbag light, etc?

4) I feel like a lot of these integration questions will depend on the capabilities of the car itself. Are there certain brands that are more friendly to the kinds of things we want to do?",2,1761671893.0,5,CarHacking,1761766681,2025-10-28 17:18:13,2025-10-29 19:38:01,"brifgadir (Score: 1): Sure, it's possible but depends very significantly on the car model.

In the similar way you can read user's input via CAN bus (ex. from the steering wheel, pedals), though it needs reverse engineering of each particular case. Some simple devices communicate through LIN bus instead of CAN.

As far as I'm aware, the most progress of such reverse engineering in public internet is being done for BMW and VW, mainly in Europe.

Pubelication (Score: 1): ""Yes"" to all questions, but with some caveats. 

- Everything will depend on the game used. You need a game that outputs data like RPM, speed, turn signals, etc.
- You need an interface between the game and a controller. Usually, this is done with python and there are projects out there that have done all of the heavy lifting. Look for Euro Truck Simulator 2 (or ETS2) on github. Although this is probably not the game you want to use, you can see how things interface. Hardware-wise the interface is basically just a microcontroller with CAN capability.
- Choose a car that has very well documented CAN messaging. Without that, you'll have to reverse-engineer CAN messages, which is tedious and can take months. Avoid new(ish) cars as many now have CAN encryption and extended messages. I can vouch for the BMW E90 3 Series. You can buy an entire car for a couple thousand, or parts separately. Everything is well documented.
- You'll want to get rid of as many control modules as possible. The ECU and other modules can freak out when parts are missing, however you can use parts separately like the gauge cluster, iDrive, likely the steering and ABS modules. You do not want to use the OBD port, since OBD data is limited to what the gateway is programmed to provide. Tapping right into the CAN buses is the way to go.

I have been working in this space for years and am able to provide custom interface hardware and some software support. Feel free to DM me.

agent_kater (Score: 1): FWIW, my 2014 Zafira has two CAN busses, both available on the OBD2 port and all the values you mentioned are available there. The only thing that's affected by the immobilization is the ECU, which you don't need, so you should be able to control the rest of the modules just as you say.

There doesn't seem to be a convention on whether the sender or the receiver makes a decision. So for example for an indicator, like an overtemperature light, sometimes the temperature is evaluated by the ECU and then sends ""light on/off"" to the instrument cluster, but in other cases the ECU will just send the temperature and the instrument cluster decides whether to light up the indicator. What this means for you is that in order to light up that indicator, you might have to fake a number of engine conditions to get the instrument cluster to lights up a certain indicator.

One more caveat... let's say you keep the steering column module which reads the light switch and also the fuse box module which controls the lights, but you want to control the lights independently of the light switch, then you have to break the CAN bus between the two modules, you can't override the light state by injecting a message into the bus because it would be overwritten by the steering column module immediately. In my car most of the modules send their switch state every 100 ms, not just when you turn the switch."

**TL;DR** : Car randomly has errors with electrical systems. My initial investigation suggest it is just an issue with steering angle sensors. Dealership says we should replace entire steering gearbox for $4500. I’m perplexed. 

**CONTEXT:**
About 1 week ago, I started my car (2018 Honda Civic EX) and was greeted with an array of new errors:

- Electric Power Steering
- Brake System problems (Brake Hold)
- Vehicle Stability Assist
- Hill Start Assist

I don’t drive much. Under 45k miles on this 2018 Honda Civic. I’ve never had issues with my car but this just came up out the blue. Prior to these errors, the car hadn’t been driven in ~3 days. Nothing notable leading up to those days.

A friend and I ran diagnostics and the error codes we got were:
- U0126-00 | CAN Communication Failure with Absolute Steering Wheel Angle Sensor
- C0051-96 | Steering Angle Sensor Failure (Sensor detects internal failure)

This made me think there was just a sensor that either need replaced or reconfigured. Specifically the Steering Angle Sensor. So I took it up to the dealership to get it recalibrated.

**THE PROBLEM:** 
After taking car to dealership, they are recommending we replace the steering  gearbox. They quote me at ~$4,500. That’s insane lol

They site the following error codes:
- C1420-29
- C1422-14

When I ask why we’d need to replace the entire thing rather than just a sensor, they say it *may* fix it (temporarily) but this issue could arise again. They site error code C1422-14 as being the biggest factor for this recommendation.

I still need to do my research on these errors and recommend fixes, but something still isn’t sitting right with me. So I wanted to ask y’all first…


**QUESTIONS**

1.) How could a relatively “young” car, which mostly sits, need to have the entire steering gearbox replaced? Again, I can understand a sensor going out. But how can something like this just happen? (NOTE: no chewed wires from rodents have been noted)

2.) With the limited info you’re running off of, does this fix seem… excessive? To an extent, I agree: do the job done once and do it right. But if there’s only a *chance* this issue comes back up, shouldn’t we just do the sensor first?

3.) Can I get a pulse check? The price they’re quoting is high, right? (~$4500) Or does this seem reasonable for parts & labor?

2017 Jeep Wrangler 
140k miles 

My Jeep has had a couple sluggish starts over the last month or so. Usually I take the key out of the ignition, wait a few seconds, put it back in and it starts up. Thanks to my work, I fill up my tank daily , in the morning. Then a few weeks ago, a Monday, I had a day where the engine just wouldn’t turn over. After several tries, suspecting the engine wasn’t getting fuel, I pumped the gas peddle a couple times and it started up.

I called my dealership that day and made an appointment to drop it off the following Sunday, 6 days later. As my work contract had changed I didn’t fill up each day, instead I drove the Jeep until my gas light came on Saturday night. Between Monday and Saturday there was no further issues with it starting. Saturday night I stopped and put $15 worth of gas since I was dropping it off the next day, I didn’t want to fill up at a major gas station ( racetrack ) I drive the vehicle after fueling for about 30 more min, no issues. The next morning it starts again just fine and I make the hour drive to the dealership ( the one closer to my house I don’t trust ) no issues at all during the drive and drop it off. 

It takes them about a week and they tell me that, as well as some other maintenance issues covered by my crazy expensive warranty, that the issue that I brought it in for is “bad gas” and they need to purge the tank and fuel lines. And that since it’s caused by an “outside source” my warranty won’t cover that work. Price tag they give me is $800. Am I crazy, but I fail to see how bad gas currently in the system is causing an issue that originated over a month ago and has slowly been getting worse, but intermittent. It sounds like, to me, they are trying to attribute a cause that my warranty WONT cover. The one time I’ve experienced contaminated fuel, I didn’t make it through the full tank before the problem was bad, and I noticed something was different pretty soon after getting the gas.

1oijiec,Can you help me diagnose an issue?,"I was driving down the highway when my car started shaking pretty bad. It got so bad that I pulled over to the side of the road and to check what was wrong. When I braked, there was kind of a squealing sound. I smelled a burning odor when I got out and didn’t notice anything else. When I tried to get back to the highway, I noticed the brake pedal was extremely stiff, it wouldn’t go down much at all. When I tried to drive the car, the car wouldn’t move, as if it was stuck on park. I waited a bit and tried again, and this time the car moved slightly but it was pulling to the left when I was trying to go straight. After about 2 hours of waiting, the car was able to move pretty normally as if nothing was wrong, although sluggish and kind of struggling to accelerate, and I was able to drive it a short distance home. These symptoms lead me to believe I might have a seized caliper or a faulty brake booster.

1oiik27,RAM 2500 Diesel Question - Long,"**This is kind of long, so I apologize up front. I want to provide as much info as possible.**

I have a 2024 Ram 2500 diesel. I got a check engine light on it last week, so I took it to the dealer to get it checked out. The codes were P0299 Turbocharger underboost and P24A-00 Particulate filter restriction. Mileage on the truck was 3239 miles. (We bought it in April of this year.)

The tech stated the DPF restricted due to low mileage under light loads not allowing the PDF to regenerate or burn off while driving, which made sense.

They also did a PCM update to correct the turbo underboost issue. They updated from 52370491AA to the current 52370431AB. (The number correlation seems off to me because the number sequence goes down and not up which is odd for software, but I guess this is a part number.)

The truck was the then road tested and driven enough to put the DPF into regen. When I got it back, the display showed 0% on the DPF. Clean, good to go.

This isn’t the first time I’ve gotten the P0299 code. Shortly after getting the truck, I would get them, but they would usually reset themselves after a few days. Even while just sitting in the driveway. I had spoken to Ram tech support, and they felt it was a sensor error, and it was just self-correcting because it was resetting quickly.

Here’s the rub. After getting the truck back I parked it for a day. Then two days after getting the truck back I went to run errands, about an 8-mile run, mostly on the freeway. After my first stop, I started heading to my next stop, drove about 100 yards and the check engine light came back on. I went to the DPF display and it showed 25% of capacity, after a little over 8 miles.

So, my brain says to me. Me, get on the freeway and put the hammer down and see if I can burn this off. I drove for about 20+ miles at 70 to 80 miles, nothing happened. No change. So, then my brain said to me. Road trip. So yesterday my wife and I decided to go on a bit of a road trip to see if we could burn it off. This worked after about 180 miles of roughly 70 mph average sustained speed. The DPF display now shows 0% But the check engine light has not reset as I was led to believe it should. I am taking it back to the dealer. (This is all warranty work.)

Is there anything I should be looking for? I don’t feel any loss of power while driving it. The truck drives like a bat out of hell. I understand the emissions systems today on diesels are much different than what I worked on in the service in the 70’s (there were none.) and deletion is out of the question at this point. I guess I’m just looking for some pointers from the pros that have forgotten more than I’ll ever know.

I bought new tires for my car and had an alignment done. Afterwards it felt like the steering was heavier and like it was dragging, similar to low tire pressure. It required a little bit more throttle to get the same acceleration.

1oii2q9,Need help with 2008 Subaru Outback not starting,"Ok, I'm at my wits end with this. I'll try to keep the issue and what has been done so far to fix it succinct, but GODDAMMIT I've tried everything I've researched and did the repairs a mechanic diagnosed, and it still won't start! 

2008 Subaru Outback 2.5L AWD LL Bean edition. 226k miles. I've owned it for about 18 months. 

The check engine light came on about 2 months into owning it. Got the codes checked: Catalytic converter and oxygen sensors. I've felt with that before and while it's not good for the environment, I've never had a car stop working because of our, so I let it go because I'm poor. 

In May or so of this year, it stopped cranking reliably. We world start it in the morning, drive it, park, them when we went to start it again, it would just chug and not start. After waiting for 20 min or so and trying it a few more times, or would eventually start. This became more and more frequent. 

In August, it stopped cranking completely. It will just chug and chug like it wants to, but can't. 

I did a TON of Internet searches trying to figure out what was wrong. Here are the fixes we've tried that have not resulted in any repair: 

New spark plugs
New spark plug wires
New fuel pump 

I finally had a mobile mechanic come out and he diagnosed a burnt out catalytic converter and bad battery working harness. I ordered the parts so he could repair it, but then the company he works for decided where I live is ""outside their operating area"" and stopped allowing me to make an appointment. I tried texting him multiple times at his private number and he ghosted me. 

After failing to find another mobile mechanic to come fix it, I watched a bunch of YouTube videos on how to replace the catalytic converter and just did it myself. I also replaced the battery cables with a direct fit harness from Subaru rather than trying to splice generic cables together. I replaced the battery because when the cables were home up, it was DEAD.

Here's where it gets weird and I'm needing help.

I got the cat out of the car on Saturday, not needed another tool to remove the plugs in the holes for the O2 sensors, but got someone to bring me to AutoZone with my old battery and get a new one. I hooked up the new battery and decided to see if it would start without the cat installed. It took a couple tries, but IT STARTED! It sounded like a demon from hell and smelled awful, but it started! 

I just finished insisting the brand new catalytic converter, hooked up the O2 sensors... And nothing!!! It won't crank, and I'm at the limit of my ability to figure it out!

The fact that it DID crank without the cat installed makes me think it's an air intake issue, that it's not getting enough air to start the engine, not I don't know what that means as far as what party to replace to get it to start.

1oihpk4,Tire recommendation for Tesla Model Y (Minnesota weather — all-season vs all-weather?),"Hey everyone,

I drive a **2021 Tesla Model Y Long Range AWD**, and I’m due for a new set of tires before winter hits here in **Minnesota**. As you can imagine, our winters can get nasty — snow, ice, freezing temps — but I also want decent performance and efficiency during the warmer months.

I’ve been looking at two options so far:

* **Michelin CrossClimate 2**
* **Michelin Pilot Sport All Season** 

I know both are solid tires, but I’m stuck trying to decide which makes more sense for my situation. From what I’ve read, the CrossClimate 2 is more “all-weather” and better in snow, while the Pilot Sport AS4 gives better dry handling and might slightly improve range/efficiency. I’ve also seen some people mention that Tesla recommends the **Goodyear Eagle F1 Asymmetric 5 M+S**.

My priorities are:

1. Good grip and braking in snow and slush (I don’t want to slide around in Minnesota winters)
2. Reasonable tread life
3. Minimal battery/range loss (I know aggressive tread hurts efficiency)
4. A quiet, comfortable ride

Would love to hear from other Tesla owners — or anyone who’s driven through cold climates — about what’s worked best for you. Did you notice a big difference in range between these tires? Any other recommendations I should consider?",1,1761676975.0,2,AskMechanics,1761766681,2025-10-28 18:42:55,2025-10-29 19:38:01,"-NOT_A_MECHANIC- (Score: 1): If your priorities are in that order, definitely crossclimate.

1oie2hh,Help diagnosing a clutch issue with my 2015 Jeep Renegade 1.4,"The clutch and flywheel were replaced a little under 40k miles ago. I’m unsure if they replaced the slave cylinder at that time.  Vehicle is currently at 122,600.

The issue started with a spongy clutch pedal and one morning it just laid on the floor.  I replaced the master cylinder, bled the system and it drove, shifted and acted just like it should for 2-3 days.  
I have gone back to bleeding just to be absolutely certain that’s not the issue.  

Now, the clutch stays partially disengaged even when the pedal is not pressed and all the way up.  I think I’m saying that right.  The car acts like I still have the clutch pedal partially pressed when it’s not.  Without touching the pedal, I can push on 1st or reverse and the car will bump in that direction.  
When in gear, I can slowly let off the pedal completely and the car won’t stutter while continuing to creep.  

I believe it could be the slave cylinder but I don’t understand why it worked fine for a short time with the new master.

1oibjez,"Car's been at the shop 4 weeks. Still no timeframe, still no updates.","Dropped my 2004 WRX off at a shop about 4 weeks ago. It's my winter car and it needed a few things diagnosed I've been putting off. We have two other cars, so this one gets about 500-1000 miles a year.

Items needed:

\- Wheel bearings, possibly all four. Press-in style, which I why I couldn't do it myself.

\- Front axle is seeping, likely needs just rebooted. Typically OEM ones work best on these cars, so saving it is likely the best way to go. Might as well reboot the entire front while it's all apart.

\- Front tie rods are seized. A shop years ago tried heat to unseize them, but they were frozen. Ball joints are good, but they're good for now. Figured if they're in there, just replacing all of this now would be ideal.

Emailed the shop to start with the above. They asked if I was dropping it off or staying with it. Chose to drop it off given it's obviously a bit more extensive. He said cool, bring it down and they'll take a look. Was expecting a call in 2-3 days or something, but didn't hear back for 3 weeks.

I stopped by on the way back from some errands. Car was moved. They said they took a look at it and they'd suggest all four wheel bearings and some ""other stuff"" (but didn't mention what). Started mentioning a full engine rebuild as it's leaking some oil - which is true, but I've been dealing with it for the last decade like this as it's not hemorrhaging oil. I've had the car 13 years and worked on Subarus for 20, so I know my way around them. It's in ok shape minus the wheel bearings and axle. Most other parts have been replaced/serviced. Said they'd call with a full run down of the quote and suggestions.

It's another week later (4 weeks total) and I still haven't heard of anything. Still no timeframe even. This is reminder of why I do 90% of repairs myself. I didn't think the car needed to be down 2 months over wheel bearings and an axle.

First, is this normal these days with shops? No communication, cars just sit around for a month or two. The other shop I go to schedules, you bring it down, it's diagnosed in a day, usually fixed the day after when they get parts in. I get it's a larger repair, but I'm really thinking this might be a 2-3 month downtime if I don't do something like just go pick the car up and take it somewhere else.

So it's not about the car itself, but the price you're paying to buy the used car. Any used car is worth it, if it's cheap enough and lasts long enough.

If the EGR valve is open when it shouldn't be, thus the ECM is not compensating for it, then it makes sense that you could get some acceleration until the ECM takes over & corrects it, because it would be similar to a vacuum leak, except with some traces of unburned fuel already mixed in.

So it seems like 2025 makes sense in terms of time gap but I didn't drive the car at all from 2020 - 2023. Would an alternator be expected to degrade in quality if not being used?

Unfortunately I have misplaced the last invoice about the battery change but I reckon it happened after the last alternator change. I used it in another car before switching it to the car in question back in 2023 so I'm guessing that it has no more than five years, probably less.

Based on all this, and the fact that I don't have a multimeter, what would you think is the likely culprit?  
I have a fairly new battery in my summer car which won't be used during the coming months so I could just switch that battery in and see whether the battery light comes back? Are there any foolproof signs that would indicate it is the alternator?

1oi3zbs,Could this BMW M850i have been overheated before the crash? Worried it might be a staged insurance loss,"Hey everyone,

I recently won a 2020 BMW M850i at auction but haven’t paid yet. It was listed as a “collision,” though the damage looks pretty minor — mainly the front-left wheel and suspension.

What’s throwing me off is a clear coolant burst in the engine bay, right in front of the deposit. It looks like it happened once, clean and strong, not a slow leak. The hood and structure are fine, and it seems like there is no residue or old buildup.

I believe these cars have a pressure-release valve built into the coolant cap, but the amount sprayed makes me wonder if it might have overheated before the crash — maybe even to get it written off by insurance.

I’ll attach the photos of the coolant marks and the engine bay. Any professional insight would be really appreciated before I finalize the purchase.

The impact even if it wasn’t strong enough to damage the radiator significantly, is going to momentarily spike the pressure in the system. This is really just my opinion though as that’s how physics usually work.

Also just to add on, auctions can be deceiving. Even accidents perceived as minor can have expensive underlying damage. Especially for a car like this.

So here’s the story, I had to put it all back together, exhaust manifold and cat were torn off, snapped bolts, valve cover was off. I am ashamed to say I put whatever I could back together using random fasteners, temporary solution, just to see what I was working with since some shady mechanics took it apart. And it was still a no start. But it had good compression, it had spark, but no fuel. So after going testing everything fuel related, everything ignition related, the distributor was good, there was a spark plug wire with no resistance so I swapped that out, I found an extremely corroded O2 sensor and after swapping it out the car fired right up, it was preventing the injectors from firing. I was happy. I ran it for 45 seconds before I was like I better turn it off, and install the proper studs and fasteners on the exhaust system.


I learned to weld to get the broken studs out, I installed new studs new bolts, seals, gaskets.
Anyways I go to start it again, and it runs a bit rough for about 3 mins.. but then when I put it in drive, it starts to sputter and shuts off, then it wouldn’t turn on.


Lost compression across all 4 cylinders, like absolute zero. In the video you can hear the engine spinning freely. You don’t hear the chug. Absolute zero compression. Across all cylinders, I even stuck a paper wad in them, and they didn’t blow out. The gauge is good I tested it with my air compressor 


I don’t think it’s a blown head gasket, that would still hold some compression in some pistons.. and even a bent valve wouldn’t cause this.. maybe if all four got bent at the same time.. but it’s a non-interference engine so I doubt it?


I did a leak down test on all cylinders. All at top dead center with the valves closed. I used a borescope to confirm they were top dead center with the valves at closed position.


Cylinder 1 lost 20%, cylinder 2 lost 20%, and this is acceptable on cold engines, but here’s the strange part, both cylinder 3 and 4 lost 90% through the intake, so I’m guessing the intake valves aren’t sealing all the way on those?
But.. this would still not cause a full compression test failure throughout all cylinders right? If it would- can someone explain to me how this would happen? It’s not possible right?

I plan to have the head restored at some point but for now I just need it to run again. It was running a bit rough.


Any other ideas? Do you think maybe the timing belt jumped a tooth or two? Would this cause it to lose all compression and spin freely?


I know the timing belt is in there still, and I took the valve cover off and the camshaft spins, I know the crankshaft spins because all the pistons moved smoothly when I looked through the borescope.

1ohwuwr,External oil leak from head? Is this even possible?,"I recently bought a 2013 Chevy Sonic lt 1.6 (only produced in Mexico) with an oil leak. No codes, engine runs fine (as far as I could tell). First thing I did was change the timing belt, seals (they were leaking) and tensioner, change the oil, flush the coolant. This helped but the leak persisted. I then changed the valve cover gasket, which looked wet/weeping. The pan is dry. The leak was now less but still there. I checked the plugs and they looked ok: no steam-clean appearance, no soaked look, etc. I changed them anyway.



Next, I took the car to a real mechanic who diagnosed leaking oil cooler gaskets, and I left the car with him. A few hours later, he calls to tell me that the oil cooler gaskets are fine but that the leak is from the cylinder head, most likely due to a previously poorly done resurfacing. He told me to monitor it and did not charge me for the inspection. He has a very good reputation as a professional, honest technician. But I do not think he actually removed the head to inspect it because it would have been a pretty involved procedure, right? The car runs fine, no codes, no white smoke out the exhaust.



So my questions are: how could he be sure? What, if anything, should I do? I really want to avoid replacing the head if at all possible. OTOH, it has only 113,500 kms on it and is in very good shape.

If your previous job was as an operations manager, that was probably more of a managerial/ desk/ people management position, correct?   Your skill set is possibly more commensurate with some kind of service or HR manager position.

Lube tech jobs can sometimes be an entry point to becoming a tech, but to take that career path will absolutely involve going to school- the only difference is the dealer will pay for it and it will be very piecemeal so advancement in the trade is usually much slower than getting an automotive degree and industry certifications right at the beginning.   Without factory training in specialized areas you can not perform most warranty repairs at the dealer level because the manufacturer will not pay the dealer for the work; this limits what kinds of entry level work they can assign to you.    Also, YSK that techs are required to provide their own tool sets in most shops, which can be a significant up front expense.

I suspect that younger people with no experience may be getting hired over you because for those jobs  the employers are not looking for highly skilled people, they are looking primarily for people that are willing to work for low wages and stay in those jobs because they tend to have high turnover and when an employe  decides they do not like the work and leaves it costs the employer money in lost productivity plus hiring and training costs.     Managers likely think you are way overqualified for a lube tech job that does not pay a living wage and probably won't stick with it  for very long so they will likely be hiring a replacement for you pretty quickly.   When hiring a lube tech they are primarily looking for someone that can learn to change oil and tires quickly without messing things up, and that will be happy doing that for several years  at relatively low pay without quitting.

Commercial auto repair is nothing at all like working on cars for fun at home or fixing up project cars on the weekends.    The industry is high pressure and production based- jobs are paid by a flat rate system with the time allotments set by the manufacturer.    Most typical dealer techs are expected to produce around 60 billable hours of flat rate labor in a 40 hour work week; less than that slows down the production in the shop and can back up the schedule.     Being able to produce at that rate accurately and independently does require some experience and familiarity with industry standard diagnostic and repair processes- that is where training comes in.    Getting you those skills means that the employer must pay for instructor led training classes and send you there (meaning you are not producing any income for the shop when doing this), and some amount of hand holding by other techs for things you can learn on the job (which slows down their productivity and can affect overall shop profit).     Also, other techs do not want to be responsible for teaching you things you should already know if you get hired into a tech position, since that means they can not produce their maximum amount of billable hours resulting in their pay check being smaller at the end of the week.

My advice would be to (1) think honestly about why you want to do this for a living and whether you would enjoy the high stress self sufficient work environment where you need to teach yourself new things from service information every day and solve problems while under time pressure,  and (2) If you do want to do this type of work for a living the best course of action in my opinion would be to complete an automotive associates degree from a manufacturer sponsored college level training program.   These programs are designed to provide quality entry level techs for that brand of dealerships and include some amount of paid internship employment in a dealer shop as part of the curriculum.    Upon completion you will have all the theory, skills, training in that brand's service procedures and repair practices and will usually have several job offers waiting at graduation.     You can be a trained tech in 2 years, where you can spend 5 or 10 years working up from a lube tech job  to get to that point and still not know enough theory and standard diagnostic procedures to make the job easier.     Starting out in middle age means you probably can not afford to spend working up from the bottom slowly, making not a whole lot more than minimum wage for much of that time, right?    It is not a job you can learn to do efficiently and well in a few years, so the more skills and knowledge you start out with the faster you will advance and the more money you will make once you become good at it.      Incidentally, it is not uncommon for experienced knowledgeable techs to make more then you were at your previous job, especially if you live in a metropolitan area.     Getting to that level from a lube tech position taking a training class once or twice a year will be difficult and time consuming though.

1oidem3,1.8 hybrid corrolla - dealer vs independent servicing,"Hi, could anybody advise please?

I’ve got a 2021 1.8 hybrid Corolla and soon I’ll need to have it serviced. Servicing at Toyota is expensive — £430 for the full service. However, if I service it at Toyota, I will get an extended manufacturer’s warranty, including a battery health check, which extends the warranty on the hybrid battery.

They’ll also check the inverter, inspect all hybrid-related components, and replace the cooling fan filter for the battery.

Additionally, they’ll use genuine filters and oil.

On the other hand:

I can go to an independent garage and pay about £200–250 for a full service. I won’t get the extended warranty, and they’ll use whatever oil they consider suitable. The filters and parts won’t be genuine.

I’ve read online that although these cars are reliable, they have tighter tolerances when it comes to things like oil and aftermarket parts. Even if the filters are good quality, the fitment might cause issues if it’s not exactly right. Not sure if I should worry about the oil they use - if its 0w-16 should be right does not matter the brand that much ?

Because it’s a hybrid, I’m a bit worried that an independent garage might mess something up.

I’ve got the car on PCP, and so far it has only had dealership services. It now has 58k miles on the clock.

Am I overthinking it, and should I just go with an independent garage?

I got this car because it meant to be cheap to run and reliable - but if I end up paying £430 just for service.. its not going to be that cheap to run anymore.. am looking to save some money. Not sure if its worth it though

VW group cars making under 250nm torque / 150 shaft horsepower tend to have a DQ200 ""Dry Clutch"" DSG box with 7 speeds

This is quite different to the conventional ""wet clutch"" DSGs. In the early days of the DSG boxes a lot of users found that some ""sealed"" boxes failed if not actively serviced with new fluid on a regular basis

Since then its become folklore that all DSGs are sealed but must be serviced anyway, and that you must find a servicing shop thats willing to ""break the rules"" and change the fluids even though the manual says not to.

In the real world, wet-clutch DSGs are not sealed(any more) and do need fluid changes and will fail without them, eventually

DQ200 is mechanically not a million miles removed from the old Smart Car automated manual gearbox in design and is genuinely designed to have a long service life, with the only serviceable items being the clutch packs themselves  (crawling in heavy traffic is bad for these, unlike a conventional torque converter auto). While its possible to change the fluids, albeit difficult, the fact that they arent used in the same way as in a conventional DSG means the need really isnt there

the UK is full of DQ200-box cars that have done 150-200K on original fluids without issues.  If it isnt failing, leave it alone.

In terms of the early SLKs, they were one of the first folding tin-tops, so now they're 20+ years old, the main thing that's going to kill them that's not corrosion is electrical failures because of water leaks and issues with the hydraulics on the roof mechanism.

A golf is a nice car but I’d go test drive a civic (1.5) and a Mazda 3 as well. 

Get a car with a camera already rather than retrofit, your insurer may class a retrofit as a mod which is a pain, as well as usually being poorer quality or expensive.

SnooCats1028 (Score: 1): We have a 1.0 TSI 2020 Golf which is very similar and it is a very good car, comfy and has good tech. If you can charge at home and don't do a big mileage I would go electric, less to go wrong and far cheaper to run."

Worst case, even if you declare to insurers, they aren't recognised as meeting safety standards.

So if you crash and take someone out, insurers subrogate thier entire losses onto you, if for instance you're driving at night and the other party says you had evil headlights.

no73 (Score: 8): Cheap chinese garbage headlights are definitely a great idea and will never ever have a terrible beam pattern, throw no light, shake and wobble like Michael J Fox after a night on the lash, blind oncoming drivers, then fail suddenly after 6 months. 


The fact they're not E marked almost certainly means they're not capable of passing a lighting test. 


As always, the good advice is don't buy anything you care about, want to last, or need to perform as advertised off Temu or equivalents.

1ohvaab,Ford Mondeo tdci engine management light,"Hi all
I have a Mondeo tdci 08 .
106 k . FSH. 
So the cars engine management light keeps returning. 
My obd scanner says. P2002 efficiency below requred threshold bank 1.
I've had the dpf cleaned, sensor replaced . 
The light has returned after 1 week or so. 
Same fault coming up. 
Also the car is abit jerky in early gears. 
After having the dpf cleaned the car on 2 occasion had big clouds of blue smoke .
It didn't effect the cars performance,
Took it back to the garage and they did something which make the blue smoke stop but straight after I would get black smoke constantly.
The mechanic seemed lost and confused.
I asked around for advice and was told to take the battery of and leave it for a few hours,
I did that and that seems to have help a lot . Now I get the occasional black smoke in early gears when pushed, otherwise nothing.
I've taken it for a run in high revs. Also using prem diesel. 

Engine light is still in. I can reset with my scanner but it comes back after a day or 2.
I'm lost . Need advice ",0,1761610960.0,8,CartalkUK,1761766681,2025-10-28 00:22:40,2025-10-29 19:38:01,"Status-Ad-5543 (Score: 2): Pop some deisel turbo cleaner .. like wynns

CarpeCyprinidae (Score: 2): This is just a factor of the complexity of 21st-century diesels due to emissions control hardware. the car gets old (17 now) and things start playing up.

You'll be able to identify the failing part and replace it, probably at huge expense, but this is your life now for as long as you keep this car.
