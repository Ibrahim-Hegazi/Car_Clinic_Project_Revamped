1onse82,Quick lube horror story? You tell me,"Let me just start off by saying that I normally do not go to the quick oil change places due to the fact that I’ve seen so many negative responses throughout the Internet regarding these places however, my wife’s job changed, which makes it hard to get to our normal onto the quick change story I went this past weekend to get my 2014 diesel Chevy Cruz oil changed. Everything seems fine. you know the typical upsell of oh your engine filter is filthy! And trying to upsell you left and right I stood firm. They never asked me what make or model. My car was and I did not see them grab the vent, which is odd as they also replaced the oil filter, they had a heck of a time getting the oil filter off and the manager, I presume asked me what kind of fuel do you put in this car? And I said diesel and she didn’t really give me a response either way she even asked for the owners manual because they’re having such a hard time getting the oil filter off. When they finally get the oil filter off, she essentially sold me as it is “filthy!“ Even though I’m only 3500 miles since my past oil change which included an oil filter replacement question one should I be concerned that they may have put the oil filter that’s supposed to go on the gas Chevy Cruz instead of diesel Chevy Cruz. then towards the end I see her go off in the corner on a phone call and I can get the vibes that it was about my  car as she kept looking back at me.

She then comes back and tells me that the oil that I normally put my car the 5W-30 what they told me at the beginning that was being put in my car was out of stock and that they would be used 10W-30, but rest assured that it’s pretty much the same thing I live in Iowa for context I think it’s fine. Maybe I get an oil change in the next month or so but who knows. Then comes today where I knew I had to make this Reddit post. There was no oil in my driveway when I left home there was no oil in my work  parking lot when I left. But when I got home, there was quite a bit of oil maybe 3 to 4 drops on my driveway fresh. Sadly I’m not able to look it over now as my wife had to go to work and she takes my car and I realize it after she left. What do I do?

1ons6ir,Brake issues with Chevy Equinox,"Hey everyone. I’m sort of at a dead end here so I’m reaching out for help.

My grandparents car is a 2014 Chevy equinox with only 43,000 miles.

In June they had the front brakes replaced. The shop said rear were fine.

About two months or so later they started having squealing again. So they took it back in. The place said the rear were dry and dirty, and the front driver side brake pad was sort of “crammed in crooked like it got hung up and dug down uneven”. This is all 2nd hand I’ve heard this.

So they replaced the front pads again. A few weeks later squealing again. Took it back and they said front were fine, rear were slightly glazed but still good thickness. They could replace rear pads. It was cheap so they did this.

Two more weeks pass and the squealing is back. Very loudly now. When going in reverse and braking it is an ear piercing high pitched squeal. When braking I’m normally driving down round there is faint squeal like brake indicators. Once again back to shop: this time they admit it’s front again and they said it must have been bad pads and they replace them for free under warranty.

Guess what? 3 weeks later it’s back: same exact sound, same side, in the front. What could be happening here. This is an extremely softly driven car. I don’t want them getting scammed but this is crazy. I’m assuming the shop is missing something. We’re about to take it in again, but I want some ideas of what I should tell the shop to look for. I have attached a video of it braking in reverse.

I have a 2019 Dodge Charger Daytona 392, and my alternator went out. So I bought a new one, as well as a new battery. I had them both bench tested before I took them, and they said they were good. I came home, put them both in and almost immediately had issues. 

Right when I started it, the voltage on both the battery and alternator measured 14.2 volts on my multimeter. After about 10 minutes of driving, the battery light came on and the voltage started dropping. When the light came on, it was at 12.5 v and started fluctuating up and down by around 0.1 v.  If I revved it, the voltage went up to about 13, then dropped again. Even in neutral, revving the engine made the voltage rise and fall. 

I had the code scanned and it came up as P2503, which is apparently charging system voltage low 

When I got home, the alternator was too hot to test, but the battery came in at under 12 volts.  I removed the intelligent battery sensor and bought a replacement but have not installed it yet.

Do we think that sensor could be causing the issue? Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you so much!

Two weeks ago I bought the car I had wanted for years. It was in perfect condition, both inside and out.

I only noticed one mechanical issue: the radiator water seemed dirty, as if the wrong coolant had been used. The radiator fan would turn on quickly, but the temperature never went above its normal range. Just in case, I decided to replace the coolant.

When I did the coolant change, all the “sludge” in the system caused a blockage, creating clogs in different areas and breaking the thermostat. The shop I go to replaced the thermostat and the water pump, and they told me that if it overheats again, the blockage is likely in the engine block. They said that flushing it might cause coolant leaks because of the engine’s age and high mileage. They also said they don’t really know what else could be done.

Is there any solution? What options do I have that won’t damage the engine?

NOTE: all was okay before the coolant change, all the issues with the temp started after the change

Get a “block tester” and verify you don’t have combustion gases getting into the cooling system. If you don’t, chances are the headgasket/head is fine. 

Change the thermostat first (usually easier) then the water pump. 

If you have crap in the cooling system then flush it out. If that crap is headgasket sealer then you got ripped off when you bought the car as it probably needs a headgasket or worse, a cylinder head.

Getting air pockets into the cooling system during repairs is normal. Ideally, shops use a tool that vacuums air out and allows coolant to be added into systems to minimize this. Alternatively, shops should be ""burping"" or bleeding the coolant system according to the shop manual.

If they failed to do this, then that would explain rapid losses of coolant as it finally gets to the places where air used to be.

I can't imagine a good scenario where you lose half a gallon or more of coolant without noticing a puddle or smell, but obviously look for puddles or smell for glycol to see if something else in the system failed, like a hose or housing.

(2) P1590 Code

This is a communication error between the transmission control module and engine control module. Faulty connections, bad wires, bad battery, and bad modules can all cause this. Since you recently had work done, you could probably fix this yourself by looking at a wiring diagram and reseating the connectors. They may have been moved/disconnected during the repair and just not connected properly. Tracing the connections will also allow you to see if the issue is with the wiring harness."

When I recently bought this car the inspector suggested a coolant change (although it didn't look too bad after draining it), and I know just enough to be dangerous so thought I'd attempt this...

I drained the coolant, removed the thermostat (figured I'd replace it during this), flushed the system with Prestone cleaner and distilled water, and 2 more water rinses. During all this the heater blew hot as normal, even before the blue ""cool engine"" light turned off (again all normal). I installed the new thermostat, filled it with FL22 coolant, and started running it while adding more coolant and squeezing the hoses for air.



**The Issue**

This time the heater only blew cold air, and the blue light disappeared very quickly (I think in like \~3 mins of idling). Fearing engine damage I turned it off and poked around. No obvious leaks, radiator was still full, squeezed hoses, ran it again and had the same thing (cold air, light off quickly). Did several rounds of tinkering and trying to run it and get heat.

Despite the blue light being off, the engine bay was warm in spots but not hot like after driving, and I also noticed one heater core pipe was warm to the touch and one was ambient temp/cold.

Did I panic too quickly and just need to run it? Heater core clogged? Defective new thermostat?



**Tonight my plan was to:**

* Check for leaks again, and the coolant level
* I bought an OBD2 sensor, so will run the car longer while watching the coolant temp. Also observe what the radiator fans are doing
* If the coolant temp goes way too high, maybe replace the thermostat again?
* If the coolant temp is fine but it never blows hot air, then try to flush out the heater core I guess?

I've successfully jumped the car a couple times, and went as far as replacing the alternator because it was under warranty and I knew I could do it pretty quick. I'm not actually sure how long this has been going on, because the car never dies while driving, implying the alt is still generating enough amperage to run the car.



Volt meter testing showed 12.5volts while running on the old alt, and barely breaks 13volts on the new one. Battery never seems to get above 12.4volts resting no matter what I've done so far.



I have just finished doing continuity tests on all the battery cables and a ground, no resistance detected anywhere, so I don't think the cables are falling apart, though I know it to be an issue on these older v6's. 



I am hooking up a trickle charger to the battery to see if that makes any difference- I figure I could have been given a faulty replacement alt, so if the battery takes charge this way that would help narrow things down.

I’ve been facing a strange issue with my scooter, Honda Activa and could use some advice before I commit to an expensive repair.

The problem is that my scooter stops abruptly sometimes and it won't start again UNLESS I manually blow air (with my mouth) into the gas tank. Once I blow air into the gas tank, it starts again immediately and runs fine for a while (it has its own mind). Sometimes it gets me to my destination, but other times it stops again mid-way.

I took it to a nearby mechanic to get it checked. He found that my scooter's Spark Plug had some OIL attached to it. According to him, this means my engine might be failing due to worn-out piston rings, and he suggested a costly fix or partial engine rebuild.

Thinking it was dead I got my multimeter and tested the battery, read 12.7 volts. A little confused I figured I should try to jump it anyways.

Front looks good, I'm surprised they didn't measure caster though. The rear looks to be toed in quite a bit on both sides. You may see some quicker tire wear. As for driving dynamics, it won't rotate quite as nimbly. But it not being a track car, I'm sure you're not worried about that. Toe-in on the rear would provide more straight line stability as the rear wheels will want to push towards the middle of the car and make the car drive straight (simplest way I can put it).

LR camber is more on the positive side. It's not at 0 degrees which would mean it's straight up and down, but it's almost there. The RR camber is alot more negative. This would cause the car to drift more towards the left. When it comes to camber, unless it's set at exactly 0 degrees, one side of the tire will have a slightly smaller circumference than the other. The wheel will want to rotate in the direction of the smaller circumference, an example of that would be a cone. Roll a cone and it'll rotate in a circle in the direction of the smaller end.

With the rear toe and camber being the way they are, the rear will track left at the same time as it's pushing inwards. So that is what's keeping it still within acceptable limits. As for how to correct the toe/camber - on non adjustable parts, the only way to correct them is to replace whatever is worn. Could be as simple as replacing worn springs, shocks, bushings, etc. Could be as large as having to replace the entire rear crossmember.

vlonemomo (Score: 1): Based on the alignment sheet, the rear wheel measurements are outside the ideal specifications, even though the overall indicator is still in the ""green."" A persistent pull to the left might be caused by different treads of tires aka a tire pull on the front two or something worn in the front as I believe most of them are front wheel drive but some are AWD. I'm pretty sure rear wheel might not be adjustable on a DS3. I would start with tires and go from there."

This should give you some insight ..  It is not that your vehicle isn't timed right ..  So long as those marks up top are close, you are ok.  Marks will be off a half a tooth on a lot of vehicles when you remove the belt (and sometimes when you install it).  Timing is an exact science so long as the marks line up and you have common sense enough to know what a tooth off looks like. (my image).  Belts stretch, tensioners dip and timing marks SLIGHTLY vary.  If it were me I'd throw a whole kit on it to be safe.  Make sure that those marks up top line up.  On those B20s, you'll swear you have it lined up, then you turn the engine over twice by hand, and you're a tooth off.  Sometimes starting a tooth off in the wrong direction will correct it after you turn it over a few times.  Be patient, and don't worry so much about EXACT marks ...  Use common sense .. You are either a WHOLE TOOTH OFF or you aren't.

ADDED:  And for God sake make sure you are turning the engine over clockwise on the B20.  Counter clockwise CAN cause you to skip a tooth."

1onikst,Question on 2018 Siena XLE brake pads.,"I have a question about the proper front brake pads for a 2018 Toyota Sienna XLE. My situation is a little complicated.

This is a U.S.-purchased Sienna that I shipped to my job in Egypt. About two years ago, I had a local mechanic replace the front pads because they were squeaking. After the replacement, the squeak got way worse and lasted almost two weeks. I took it back, he complained, said he fixed it, but it still squeaked for another week before finally stopping. Communication wasn’t perfect since he was speaking Arabic and my Arabic is limited, but I thought we had it worked out.

Fast forward two years — driving in Cairo traffic means a lot of braking, so front pads wear out quickly. I ordered a DuraLast set (model number DG1324) from AutoZone.com, which they said fit a 2018 Toyota Sienna XLE. I gave the new pads to my driver, who took the car to a local service station. When they pulled the existing pads — the ones installed two years ago — they said the new DG1324 pads from Autozone were the wrong size.

Now I’m wondering if, during that first replacement, the mechanic installed the wrong pads. The pads that came off this time have a different shape, and I can’t make out the full model number, but maybe someone here will recognize it from the photo.

If anyone knows what model or car those pads might belong to, or if the DG1324 pads really are the correct ones for a 2018 Sienna XLE, I’d appreciate your thoughts.",3,1762192090.0,3,MechanicAdvice,1762284995,2025-11-03 17:48:10,2025-11-04 19:36:35,kyden (Score: 1): The autozone ones are correct.

1. Is it still worth it to do a Drain and Fill right now? Or am I wasting my time since the fluid is still red?
2. Since I still have one more seal to replace, would it be an okay idea to just let as much fluid as possible drain out while replacing that seal -- and then, that way, I can skip having to deal with my old, rusty-looking transmission drain plug?

Engine oil gets dirty and burnt because of its proximity to extreme heat and carbon/fuel contamination.

Transmissions are sealed and run cooler (no explosions, just friction) so the only contamination can come from the wear parts within it. 

The biggest reason to do a drain and fill is to also replace the filter, which after 64k miles has definitely collected some crap, which is why the fluid looks good.

50k is actually a relatively long change interval for a lot of transmissions."

Car: Opel (Vauxhall) Mokka X 1.6 petrol  
2017 model year, purchased new from an official dealership in January 2018 (I’m the first owner).

Regularly maintained — yearly official servicing and oil changes (driving about 10,000–12,000 km per year).

Parts replaced so far related to the P0011 code:

* 2022: solenoid valve (camshaft adjuster) (intake side), camshaft phaser (intake side), related electrical wiring have been checked
* 2023: solenoid valve (camshaft adjuster) (intake side, again)
* 2024: camshaft phaser again (intake side, again)
* 2025: oil pump + oil change with it

There was roughly one year between each replacement (around 10-12000 km of use yearly).

About 2 months after the oil pump replacement (approx. 3,000 km later), the check engine light came on again. After a few weeks, it went off by itself, but the error code is still stored and readable.

Current symptoms:

* noticeable power loss
* slight shaking when accelerating or starting
* occasional rough idle



Two service centers have already said they have no further ideas on what to check next.

There are many YouTube videos for this.

Diagnosis and common causes

Error codes: 

The most reliable way to diagnose the problem is to use an OBD2 scanner to pull the specific error codes. Codes like C1223, C1246, and P0504 are common, as is an O2 sensor failure, notes this Reddit post. 

Low tire pressure: 

Uneven tire pressure can cause the system to falsely detect a traction issue, triggering the light. Check all tire pressures and adjust them if necessary. 

Battery issues: 

A low or failing battery can cause various electronic systems, including the VSC, to malfunction and trigger warning lights. 

Brake light switch: 

A faulty brake light switch can cause both the VSC and ABS lights to turn on. 

Potential solutions

RB The Mechanic

YouTube · Nov 18, 2018

Perform a zero-point calibration: 

If there are no active check engine lights, a calibration may solve the problem. This procedure recalibrates the VSC system's sensors, ensuring they are correctly aligned with a level vehicle. 

Ensure the vehicle is on a level surface. 

Connect a wire between specific pins (e.g., 4 and 14) on the OBD2 port. 

With the ignition in the ""accessory"" position, repeatedly touch the wires together four times within eight seconds, as shown in this YouTube video. 

Turn the ignition off, remove the wire, and then restart the vehicle. 

Clear the error codes: 

After addressing the underlying issue (e.g., fixing a leak or replacing a sensor), you can use an OBD2 scanner to clear the codes and turn off the lights. 

Visit a mechanic: 

If the problem persists, especially if the check engine light is on, a mechanic can perform a more thorough diagnostic scan and repair the malfunction

Proud and only owner of Roadrunner, a 2009 Honda Fit Sport 5 speed manual transmission with 153,500 miles on her.

I also don’t have much money to fix major problems or buy something newer so I’m kinda stuck with her regardless. Lol!

Anywho, this weekend I went to start her to go out and couldn’t get out of my driveway. 😭 The car shifts perfectly fine when it’s off. However, once she’s running and you engage the clutch, you can’t put the car into gear… it feels like I’m hitting a brick wall if I try to shift and I can hear/feel the gears grinding when I try to give it a little more push to get there (I know better than to force it and stopped when I heard the start of grinding). The clutch feels normal when the car is off, but when it’s running the clutch feels softer than usual and also feels like it’s sticking to the floor for a bit before popping back up with some force to it instead of smoothly gliding into place like it should. The clutch fluid is full and I don’t see any leaks on my driveway. What could the problem be? Is it a big undertaking that could get expensive and is it even worth it at this point? I’m financially strapped for cash right now so am trying to troubleshoot and fix what I can at home first so whatever suggestions y’all have and/or experiences with similar issues to help me out would be greatly appreciated!

We purchased the car this summer and it's been great. Absolutely no problems at all up until now. It's a 2010 Ford Edge, roughly 104,000 miles (had 99,000 on it when we purchased it). Battery was brand new in February before we bought the car in July so shouldn't need to be replaced due to age.

He was home for the weekend and yesterday afternoon met friends for a movie. When he left the theater to head home he said his car had a hard time starting. He had to crank it a few times for it to start but once it was started it ran fine for the 20 minutes from the theater to home. When he got ready to go back to school he had the same problem...he had to crank it a few times for it to start. My husband checked it out quickly and said there was corrosion on the battery posts so he cleaned them and the car fired right up with no problems. He drove it back to school and and an hour after he got back to his apartment he went out and started it again and it started right up. This morning he had to crank it again a couple of times but it started and ran fine from his apartment to school. After he'd been at school for a while he went out and started it again and he said it started smoother that second time. So clearly since there's still issues this morning it wasn't only the corrosion that was causing the problems. But, once started it runs fine and there doesn't seem to be any loss of power, no issues to with the lights/radio/electronics so maybe not the alternator?

It physically separates conductors that should be in close, tight, contact. It also reduces the size of conductors, as the corrosion is what is left of some of the metal in your conductors, leaving them narrower and with less current carrying capacity. 

Charge and test the battery at the parts store, if it passes reinstall it and use a packet of the anti corrosion grease they sell. 

Clean the battery cables/terminals. A pitcher of the hottest tap water (mixed with a little baking soda if you like) poured over the corrosion will dissolve it away, rinse with fresh hot water. 

Grease anything that is metal and goes on top of the battery, get some grease down into the copper strands of the cables (if they are exposed), if that corrosion there it will creep down the cable

Reinstall the battery, the hold down. Grease the battery posts and connect the terminals. 

**Bright and Tight*"" are your keywords. Clean metal touching clean metal. When tightening the terminals, tighten them until they can't be wiggled, then stop; you can distort the battery posts and cause leaks they're too

1omz9zo,07 Altima overheating question," Got an 07 Altima that recently had to have its water pump replaced. Before it got replaced, the temp gauge never went above halfway. You could drive it all day, city or highway, and it'd stay locked at 50%. But since the replacement, it keeps moving between 50% and the top line on the verge of crossing over to overheating. I usually start blasting the heat when it gets that high and it starts to come back down some, but it never settles like it use to. Initially I thought maybe there was some air still trapped in the system so I burped it twice (cap off, squeezing the hoses to work air out, ran it long enough to come up to temp and the thermo to open) but I still have the issue. Right now its mostly parked and I don't drive it anywhere but shortish trips because it really starts to flirt with overheating after about 20 mins of driving. After that amount of time, if I stay over 3000rpm for awhile or sit in traffic, it starts to overheat. It'll start to come back down when I'm moving and in the 2000s range RPM wise. It also only shows the problem while driving. When doing the burping and just testing things parked (idle, occasionally revving), it never goes past 50% on the temp gauge. I guess that's not too surprising since the engine isn't under as heavy a load, but just throwing it out there in case it clues someone in on what the problem might be

When you release the gas pedal, an older A/T would just coast with the engine at idle. But even at idle, the engine is using fuel to keep it running.

On newer vehicles, they have employed more advanced shifting algorithms and among other things, when you release the gas pedal at speed or going downhill, it downshifts so that the car's momentum keeps the engine running without using any fuel (injector cut-off). That jerk you feel during this transition is similar to manually downshifting to a lower gear and doing engine braking."

If the car’s worth under $5k, I’d definitely weigh whether it’s worth sinking that kind of money into it. Sometimes it’s cheaper long-term to cut losses and move on.

For what it’s worth, this is one of those situations where an extended warranty or breakdown coverage like CarShield or similar would’ve come in clutch they cover big repair jobs like timing belts or engine issues. But if you’re paying out of pocket now, I’d get a second opinion before deciding. Get another mechanic to confirm if it’s really the timing belt, and if it is, do the math repair cost vs. car value. Sometimes the peace of mind of a new ride is worth more than the repair bill."

- I can only do like 2 hot laps before needing a cooldown btw while everyone else is able to do hot laps for the full 20 minute session and still get less softness than I do in my brake pedal 
And then after a session the first like 30% of the brake pedal feels like a dead zone (even after a cooldown lap and a 2 hour break)

1on05ik,Secondary Air..........PLEASE HELP!,"I have spend countless weekends and evenings over the past 6 months trying to get my 2006 C280 4matic compliant (no CEL) to pass the CT emissions test due October 30th.



Here are the abbreviated basics on the situation:



Codes P0410, P0354, P0412 and P0108 CONFIRMED

Codes P0410 & P0354 PENDING



The Pending codes have varied in the past but they always contain some combination ( usually 2 codes ) of the 4 CONFIRMED codes that have always remained the same.



Initially, I knew  both EGR valves were bad so I replaced them with 2 used ones from a reputable junkyard who claims they were tested.  After that, the valves were no longer allowing hot exhaust / condensation into the pump /blower.



The pump/blower (Bosch ) was replaced before the last emissions test 2 years ago and to prevent the condensation / exhaust getting inside, I just plugged the openings until I needed to pass inspection in the future. Currently, the blower gets activated with cold starts and blows strong for 60-90 seconds, so I know it works.



Using the Car scanner ELM app and an HT500 (Innova) adapter, I have checked all the ""live data"" sections numerous time and all the data I see is within normal ranges. (no smoking gun).



Thinking I needed proper drive cycles after the new EGR valves were installed, I did countless drive cycles and  ""completed"" all the emission tests according to the Car Scan ELM app.



I took confirmed working parts from my W211 E350,  MAP sensor and switchover solenoid then tested them in the C280 and it did not resolve the issue. ( the parts are identical )



Cant find any vacuum leaks and I cleaned the electrical pins/sockets with contact cleaner.  Check all fuses and relays.





***Aside from the OBD2 Codes, these are the only ""Fails"" or readings out of the normal range I can find.***



**On the Car Scanner ELM app it has a section ""non-continuous monitors""   It has many different test ( like 02 sensors and stuff) all pass, every time I test!  But the secondary air monitors, Bank 1 and Bank 2 FAILED.**



Everything seems to work, including the O2 sensors but I'm failing in this area.  The secondary air monitors need to be within a certain number range.  Bank 1 monitor was something like .0078 and Bank 2 was (0) zero.  Normal range is something like .1 to 1.99 if I recall correctly.



Lastly, I keep finding conflicting information about those small blue one-way check valves that are located close to the secondary air switchover solenoid.  Some people say the arrows need to point to the engine/manifold, while others say the arrows should point to the solenoid???????  Currently, I have both arrows facing the solenoid since doing that a few weeks ago made the CEL turn-off for about a week.  However, even though the CEL was off for a week and about 70 miles, the codes always remained.  Through all this, I have never been able to clear the codes and I tried various top rated apps.



For the record- My 2006 C280 W203 has TWO of those valves, while my 2008 E350 only uses 1.

I brought my car into the shop about a week ago for brake pads + fluid and an oil change. Since then, my car has been making a  metallic grinding sound that comes and goes when starting from a stop, turning and going over bumps. I believe it’s coming from the front drivers side (maybe something with the wheel?). I first heard the noise in the video the day after bringing my car home from the shop, and as I was making a turn, I hear a metal breaking noise and the sound of something falling through my car. Got out and saw nothing on the ground. The sound completely stopped after that. Brought it back that day to the mechanic who told me my rotors looked fine and they suspected a piece of rust had broken off somewhere near my rotors.

Fast forward to today where the scraping sound came back when pulling out of a parking lot. It was worse when initially moving the car from a stop as well as when I went over speed bumps it sounded like the metal “bounced” and creaked. Thought the creaking might be my splash guard but that doesn’t explain the rhythmic spinning metal sound. The sound is not constant. It usually goes away when I am keeping consistent speed but comes back here and there when slowing down and turning.

Bought a truck as a bit of a project/just to get around and do yard work, only drive a couple days a week, the truck is higher mileage. The only thing I’ve noticed that’s a bit off, is how slow it changes from park or reverse, to drive. While it’s in reverse it feels great, while it’s in drive it also feels great, strong, no slipping or hard shifting. But the only thing is, it takes probably 4 seconds or so to get into drive. Could this be the shift solenoids failing, or is it a deeper issue?

Have you happened to use an obd2 scanner to see if it’s throwing any codes? It may not be triggering the CEL but it’s always good to check and make sure.

Since you did the fuel pump, I would make sure you’re getting good pressure at the regulator; sometimes the diagram inside goes bad you won’t have enough fuel pressure, you can tell because the vacuum line on top of it will smell like gas when you pull it off. Might also be worth running some sea foam through it to make sure your fuel lines aren’t gummed up and changing out the fuel filter while you’re at it.

If you have no problems there then I would start chasing down sensors. Make sure your MAF is clean, inspect your idle air control valve and check stuff like your O2 sensors, etc. New coil pack and plug wires couldn’t hurt, but I would be leaning towards a fuel or sensor issue. I would try using some starting fluid to see if it has less trouble turning over to verify.

I actually had a similar issue on my ranger where it would spontaneously not start and just crank endlessly. Rarely it would start but not stay running unless I kept the rpm’s super high. Would run off starting fluid for a short time and that was it.

the options i’m considering now (along with the ones i bought) are listed below

current- Sylvania 9005 LED Ultra for low beam application, google says these are approximately 1500 Lumens and 6000K - $100
Part #9005LEDHPBX2

option 1- Sylvania Silverstar ULTRA 9005 for low beam application, these ones are 1750 Lumens and 4100K, these ones are not LED and are halogen but based on the claims would have better coverage of the road and rated for 125h of life - $59
Part #9005SU-2

option 2- Type S LED light bulb 9005 for high and low beam application, these are 1800 lumens and 6500K, these ones seem like the best option but don’t make any claims of down road or side clarity like option 1, although they are led and rated for 50000h of life -$65
Part #LM57850-60-6

option 3- Type S LED Light bulb 9005 for high and low beam application. This one has all the same specs as option 2, the only difference is it is RGB color changing and has pattern modes, obviously wouldn’t use on the road but for events and pictures would be very cool - $98
Part #LM58259-60-6

What I am looking for out of all of these is the best clarity of the road, and a decently white light as my current set up is a good white color but does not provide the visibility i want. I would also like it to be LED as they provide more hours of life and less power usage, but clarity is above all.

I have a 2020 Honda CR-V sport, it’s fairly new to us, we bought it used a few months ago.  a few weeks ago the “emissions system problem” light came on the dash.  we took it to a local mechanic (we live in small town Ontario).  the code was P0456, small emissions leak.  Anyway, they replaced an expensive part and off we went $820 later.  the next day the warning returned, we took it back.  they ran a smoke test and determined the new part was faulty so they replaced it, no charge.  next day the warning was back.  at that point we felt like they maybe didn’t know what they were doing but we’d already spent so much and their work was under warranty so we went back.  I asked them to test the battery and they did, it was fine.  they replaced a valve, said it commonly is the problem.  I don’t think they did any testing really. no charge, off I went, fingers crossed.  1 day later the warning was back.  I called them and they said next they would replace the filler neck parts that can sometimes leak.  I asked if ours looked damaged or showed a leak on the smoke test and was told no.  the parts were on back order and would take 2 weeks to arrive.  I said ok because they seemed to think this was the only remaining thing it could be.  they ordered the parts and we agreed to wait.  I was not told if this would cost anything but I assume not since we've already paid and the problem is not resolved. we were told the car is fine to continue driving.  

several days later we received a letter in the mail.  during the second repairs, our car was driven and caught speeding (65 in a 40 zone) by a camera. we were charged $240.  we were obviously upset.  I had proof that they had our car so we went in and showed them and they paid it.  so here’s the thing.  I’m super uncomfortable returning.  I’ve called the nearest Honda dealership and scheduled a diagnostic for next week.  I don’t know if the filler neck is even leaking.  it could be a leak elsewhere or maybe even a sensor.  I don’t have any trust left for the first mechanic anymore.  should I call them and tell them I don’t need the part? am i obligated to pay for the part? I’m $820 in now for repairs that fixed nothing and I just want to block their number.  but also, if it IS leaking I need that part because it’s on back order and may take ages to get another one.

When the car overheats and I turn it off the fans do not continue working  ( I dunno if this should happen or not).

A bit of googling makes me think it’s an air intake for the turbo. I heard a pop, then a deflating noise, then the truck started spewing black smoke. I was able to pretty easily get the pipe back in and cranked that clamp down super tight. It held up for a day and then came out again while pulling a pretty heavy trailer. I see some black sticky residue on the pipe. Is there a tape or glue or something that I can put around that pipe to help keep it sealed? Or does it look like we’ll have to replace that whole blue rubber tube? Any info would be super appreciated!

1onovhp,Just replaced brakes and rotors went bad in a week or so. What's my best play here?,"A little over a month ago, I went to my usual mechanic to recharge the AC. I also had worn brakes and lost the brake fluid reservoir cap. Since I don't like doing brakes and I don't know the correct process to bleed brakes, I hired him to do all of the above.

This mechanic is my primary because he solved many issues that's stumped other mechanics. I rely in him a lot, but he apparently had a tech working on my car who was hung over that day. I'll just say there was 2 small mistakes that was immediately obvious and leave it at that.

And to be fair, my trust in mechanics is their work. I prefer to take my own parts in. I took a set of Brembos in. Part of the service is polishing the rotors. A few days after the brake service, the brakes were squealing, and about a week after that, the steering wheel started shaking. The rotors are bad.

Mind, he didn't charge much to polish the rotors, but his tech should have been able to see they were too thin and EOL when he polished them, shouldn't he? (I honestly don't know the answer)

So, I just bought some new rotors because I'm planning to sell this car soon. I don't know if I should talk to my mechanic about this situation, and I also don't know the answer this:

Do I need to buy new brakes or should the ones on the car be okay since they're new?

C1 and C2 were misfiring - while in shop ignition fuse blew, and coil 1 smoked. I had already replaced all spark plugs and swapped coils around during my testing to determine what it was not. I found oil in the C1 and C6 well.

Can anyone advise me on what to ask the shop so I can be sure they are not just jumping to some expensive repair. Aren't there tests that should absolutely be performed to determine it is the ECM and not something else?

2017 Honda Pilot with just over 118k miles, making this noise. It's only audible at 45mph plus, more so at highway speeds.

No extra play when pushing down on the front end. No visible leaks on the driveway. Just had timing belt and water pump replaced around 100k. Any thoughts?

What most people would do in this situation is completely drain the cooling system and replace with the proper coolant.  There are various ways to search and find the correct coolant for the vehicle.  Whatever you do, it’s probably not good to keep adding plain water to the system.  It’s designed to have a certain mixture with actual coolant and water, not be heavy on the water.  It’s usually a 50/50 mix of coolant and water.  Also, tap water can promote corrosion in the system.  Distilled or deionized water should be used.

1on8cdl,"1998 Toyota Sienna 221k Miles - Severe Coolant Leak, P0330 Knock Sensor Code, Limp Mode: Timeline and DIY Repair Ideas?","Hi everyone, 

I'm dealing with a major coolant leak on my 1998 Toyota Sienna (1MZ-FE 3.0L V6, FWD, ~221,000 miles) and could use some advice. I live in the van, so this is urgent as it's my only shelter, and I'm trying to fix it myself as that is my only choice. Here's the full timeline and what I've observed/done:

Timeline of Issues:
* Bought the van about a year ago for $1,800. Mechanic inspected it and said it was in great shape for its age but might need some “age-related repairs” soon, like valve covers. He said it was safe for long trips if needed (though I never did one).
* ~8 months ago: Replaced the front valve cover gasket myself (took a while due to inexperience, but no issues since).
* Shortly after: Alternator failed (I suspect oil from the old valve cover leak dripped on it). Replaced it with a bigger/better one—no problems there now.
* A few months ago: Had to drive to Palm Desert (roughly a 2-hour trip through the mountains both ways). Check engine light came on intermittently on the way there; pulled over, nothing obvious, light went off. On return, light stayed on, then limp mode kicked in after stopping for gas. AutoZone scan showed P0330 (knock sensor Bank 2 bad; the other sensor was fine).
* Tried a temporary fix: Spliced the bad sensor wire to the good one—worked for a few hours, then CEL and limp mode returned. Since then, driving minimally (short 5-mile errands, no highways) to avoid damage.
* ~2 months ago: While idling in a parking lot, the top radiator hose exploded. Replaced it myself—no further hose issues until now.
* Yesterday: After idling ~20 min, noticed coolant pooling under the van on both sides (bottom center, slightly driver's side). Now leaks almost as fast as I pour it in (using water for now). No power loss, starts/runs fine otherwise, but steaming if driven even 2 miles in traffic. Small leaks around radiator cap/hose connections before, but nothing major.

What I've Checked/Suspect:
* Leak location: Bottom middle, halfway past front tires, slightly driver's side. Not from passenger-side water pump, radiator cap, or reservoir. Removed battery/airbox— heater hose T-connector looked okay, but maybe missed something.
* No head gasket signs: No white smoke, milky oil, power drop, or overheating beyond steaming from low coolant.
* Suspect: Valley plate/water inlet leak (due to knock code and high miles) or thermostat housing rupture. Could be bypass hose or lower radiator hose, but rapid pour-out points internal.


What I'm Considering DIY:
* Practiced alternator replacement by pulling 3 from junkyard Siennas—worked great. Planning the same for this: Find junkyard 1MZ-FE engines, practice intake manifold removal, valley cleaning/resealing with RTV, knock sensor/harness swap.
* Then fix my van: Bundle repairs (sensors, harness, gaskets, hoses) for ~$200-400 parts. Have basic tools; worried about tight spaces/stripping threads.
* Short-term: Trying stop-leak additive? Or safe to drive 2-5 miles daily (monitoring temp, adding water) while planning?

Questions: Is valley plate likely? Alternatives? Junkyard practice feasible? Could all parts come from the junkyard? Tips/pitfalls? Appreciate any help! Thanks!

This has really been stumping me and I'm unsure if it's something I should be concerned about or not.

To cut to the chase what's been happing is after driving on the highway so high speed or higher rpm maintained my oil pressure drops.
I've got an after market gauge and it reads about 50 psi normally but drops to 30 after.
If I put the car in neutral and up the rpm the psi rises back to 50 but won't stay there once I let off. After some time idling it will return there.

Is this just oil sitting in the valve cover and it's taking its time to come back down and is fine or is something going wrong?

I should mention it's a 1966 mustang with a 250 2v from a 1971 xy falcon it's got high compression and a lumpy cam, it does need valve stem seals so it does burn a bit of oil on start. (Problem still happens straight after an oil change so I wouldn't think it's low oil level)

1on3y71,Mechanic Lied?,"
Truth be told I'm not well-versed in cars or anything about them. I have a 2012 Volkswagen passat TDI, originally purchased two years ago and had the turbo replaced. At the end of 2025 the serpentine belt snapped and we took it to the mechanic, who then told us something about some pistons being unaligned and some other stuff I cant particularly remember. It was in the shop for a few months and I got it back (April). Originally I noticed a smell of burning oil, I took it back and mentioned it but they brushed it off as it going away in a few days.

Well, cue last month and I notice my car is giving me coolant warnings. I refill but the light keeps popping up. Look further and find that the head gaskets is leaking oil. We take it back to the repair shop as it seems they messed up in the installation. Afterwards the shop claims the following:
The radiator is busted (it wasn't, we verified it wasn't upon initial inspection) 
The turbo needs to be replaced as it is ""nonfunctioning"" (we drove the car to the shop perfectly fine). This will cost $5000, the same as when it was replaced two years ago. 

From what I understand it seems everyone is saying the mechanics messed up. They said they'd warranty what they can but they're still charging us for the disassembly.

And I find it insane that you said a bunch of stuff in your post that doesn’t even make sense at all but somehow can make this assessment. 

You say at one point that the coolant warnings (not warning, warnings with an s, so multiple times? Was your engine coolant temp gauge shooting up?) came on so you’d refill with coolant. But then find the head gaskets leaking oil. Okay? And what about the coolant though?

Then you say you take it back to the shop “as it seems the messed up in the installation”. Installation of what?? Did they previously replace the head gaskets? Because you don’t mention that at all. Or was this part of “some stuff I can’t particularly remember” from before?

Not until about 2 years in did it start having transmission fluid issues, I was agoraphobic for a year or so and so the issue was left unresolved. My mom then passed who had my car under her name since I bought it with only a permit in hand. It sat for about a year without being touched due to me thinking it was going to be lost to probate court and I didnt want to risk driving it since my only option was public roads. 
We got it working with a new battery and some little maintenance, recently I took it for about a 40 minute drive to pick up someone from an airport and it suddenly worsened the issue by a landslide. The (what I assume is) torque converter has been slipping/grinding on even flat roads when previously it would only going up inclines and now the needle is jumping even when im not accelerating. 
^^ The video attached for some of what occurs, I turned the volume up on it as much as possible so you can hear whats happening but the erratic needle also speaks for itself as well. 

Is this simply the transmission fluid shudder issue or is this now becoming larger and my torque converter needs replacing? I want to fix the issue before it blows my entire transmission.

If this is the case, it means the cat is not doing it's job, changing bad gases to good/better gases out of the tailpipe. It's not ideal for emissions, but it's not a safety issue.

If sluggish poor acceleration, then have them look at it. In this case it could be clogged up and that could cause other issues that's not good. 

Third option is to have them look at it either way, so at least you know what's going on. If exhaust leak, could be a very simple fix and can go about your time. If it's the catalytic converter, you can tell your guy at home and get everything set.

For the first 25,000 miles, it was serviced yearly, which was anywhere from 5k to 10k miles, but then the Carfax report has no reports on it from 2008 until last June, a period of which it drove 60k miles.

If this a scheme that your work offer via employee benefits then as long as you meet the minimum length of employment / contract type to join the scheme (check your contract and/or company handbook) then your employer won’t say no unless it would cause your salary to fall below national minimum wage. 

Or are you worried the lease company won’t insure you because you’re a new driver? The simple solution would be to just call them and ask. Every company will have slightly different rules/criteria. Did they not ask for details about your driving history when you requested the quote? 

My old works one only cared about age of the applicant, and the amount of points on their licence (if any), and that is was a Full UK one. They didn’t care how long someone had held a licence. But just give them a call if you’re unsure.

**TVR Tuscan**

Ever since I saw this car when I was a kid, I've always wanted one. I would plead ignorance to the shouts of unreliability.

If not and want to stick to ice (internal

Fiat Panda - cute and would be higher up than the corsa but possibly not high enough

VW T-Roc - smart but more expensive

I suspect you won't go too far wrong with a Duster and the brand currency means it won't lose much value relative to some others. 

Sounds like a RAV4 would be too big for you, but that would be my other recommendation. Get an older petrol one with a solid Toyota service history and it would give you security and no trouble. 

Also don't judge a car purely on it's size, as much as that it's the perception of size/ease of seeing the corners that makes a car feel wieldy or not. Length matters less unless you are doing a ton of busy urban parallel parking in which case 4.7m plus can start to rule out some spaces for you.

sockeyejo (Score: 12): Having grown up on a farm in a rural area, I'd always pick a small, nippy car over a big vehicle for the types of roads you're describing, unless you need towing capacity or four wheel drive. Big vehicles on small, country lanes are a PITA for everyone. Small vehicles are easier to steer around potholes, get into gaps, get off grass and mud, get up steep hills with crappy surfaces, cost less to run, weigh less so take less of a battering on their own shock systems, are more fun to drive.... 

You just need appropriate tyres for the conditions, blind spot mirrors and a retrofitted reversing camera if you're nervous about that side of things, winter windscreen wash, and a commitment to clean the car regularly (underneath as well as up top). Do that and you're sorted.

I’ve had my car for 7 months at this point, it’s a 2020 plate with 30k mileage

I immediately think I have an oil leak. I checked the oil level, it’s half full. No warning for oil level has come up on the car. 

Since then though, no fluids on the road or where I’ve parked for a bit. I put cardboard under and still nothing. It drives fine

1omzppc,Opening a car body shop? Terrible idea? Worth trying?,"My boyfriend recently completed his Vehicle Accident Repair qualification and did really well. He impressed two companies during trial periods (one even offered him a job, but timing didn’t work out), and he missed both opportunities. Now he’s struggling to find any apprenticeship openings and worries that being 22 puts him at a disadvantage since older apprentices must be paid the national living wage after the first year.

He’ll soon inherit about £30k after his dad’s very unfortunate passing and is thinking of using some of it to buy some second-hand equipment and start his own autobody repair/customs business. I have a lock-up that I think could fit a spray booth, so it seems possible in theory.

Still, I’m unsure. Owning a business sounds exciting, but it’s a big commitment especially with limited experience. I believe he is skilled at spraying for his level of experience (his feedback and praise from his tutor during college were excellent), but there’s probably a lot he’d only learn on the job. Maybe we could learn as we go, but it’s risky. 

Here’s the plan briefly:

• Do a lot more research into the legal/safety/planning permission side before doing literally anything that resembles starting a business

• Build his portfolio further by spraying a few cars for free (mine, his own, my mums), to showcase his skills.

• Post videos of these cars/him spraying on social media, with an actual well researched social media marketing plan. 

• Go to every single car meet in the local area that we are able to, network with people and show off cars he’s worked on

• Work for a low price at the beginning to build experience and a reputation. The market he’s likely going to target are boy/girl racers looking for custom jobs for an adorable price (as they’re young and skint), or boy/girl racers looking for their car to be repaired without their insurance premiums hiking. 

He’s said he’s prepared to lose money, so part of me thinks he should go for it anyway. But I’d love some realistic advice, are we talking “near impossible” difficult, or “hard but achievable if you put in the work” difficult?
