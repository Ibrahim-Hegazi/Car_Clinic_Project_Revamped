The symptom is that there is no light activity at all either while driving or doing the cruise control switches ‚Äútest procedure‚Äù. The brake master cylinder was previously changed to one without the port for the pressure switch so I changed out the master cylinder and purchased/plugged in a new switch. 

Pic one is just showing that the wires are hooked up for the steering wheel switches. And yes I made sure to disconnect the battery and to not work in front of the airbag lol.

Pic two is because I found the white and cream connectors unplugged and then plugged them in. Not sure what they go to but since everything else (including the horn) works I thought I‚Äôd mention it. Oh and I know it looks like it‚Äôs not plugged in correctly but it only fits one way so I think it should be ok.

Pic three is a still currently disconnected cable. No obvious place where it goes and I also am not sure what it is supposed to do.

Just curious if it‚Äôs perhaps a faulty clockspring, steering wheel buttons, or something else you guys come up with. 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that important but for the sake of building a history there were a few oddities with the truck when I first got it. 

I worked on getting the horn working and found that the fuse for it was missing. When I plugged in the fuse it would stay on constantly lol. Had a local Indy shop fix it since I wasn‚Äôt as knowledgeable then.


After that I found the cruise pressure switch wiring and the under hood light harness snuck deliberately into the inner fender.

1mkbcwy,Sputtering start/failing to start Kia Rio,"EDIT: 77,019 miles 2016 Kia Rio

Hello everyone!! 

Very very car illiterate. I know how to change brakes and rotors, calipers and pistons, but going under the hood leaves me scratching my head every time unless I'm refilling wiper fluid or checking oil. 

Anyway, back in January, my car wouldn't start. I had bought a Diehard Silver battery not long before that, but it was really cold out, so I thought the battery either died or was frozen. I waited around an hour and a half, waiting on a tow truck, when suddenly it started again. 

Then, back in June, I went to start it up, and it sputtered a little. Drove a few miles to a grocery store, got back in, sputtered again, went to another store a few miles away, shut it off, went in for no more than 10 minutes, got back in, wouldn't start at all. Just a ""click,"" not a repetitive clicking, just one click. Sounded like it wasn't even trying to start past turning on the battery. 

I took it to the shop, and I actually drove there because it started back up about a week or so later. Told them the symptoms, they tested the relay, checked the battery (it was at 100% health), looked at the fuel pump, tried something else I don't remember, but they were not able to recreate the issue. They said they started it 30-40 times and it was always normal. 

The past week or so, it's been sputtering before starting. I was convinced it was something with the fuel pump so I have been keeping it above half a tank at all times, and I haven't had any issues until now. I let it get to a quarter tank today on my way to the vet, and was afraid it wouldn't start again, so I ran to the gas station and filled it up. When I started it, it sputtered once and then started up normally. 

I don't know if this means anything, but I'm also hearing a belt noise, especially when I use the AC and am pulling off the curb on my street. I don't really hear it while driving. Brakes need replaced because I'm hearing squeaking while accelerating. But that's about it. Also worth noting that in the past, I've had a check engine light, and when checked, it said it was the EVAP purge valve. The light went out a long time ago and hasn't come back. Not sure if that could draw any conclusions. 

Any ideas would be very helpful, as the mechanic doesn't seem confident in it being the starter. They told me to take it to the dealership to get a diagnosis, but I'm on a very very tight budget (I'm disabled and have medical bills and a new veterinary bill on top of it), and I can't afford a diagnosis there, plus whatever the work ends up costing. The shop quoted me $580 for the starter and labor and that's about all I can give now that I need brakes and potentially a serpentine belt as well. 

Anyway.... What do y'all think it could be? Sorry for the longest post ever, I just wanted to be thorough. 

Thank you all SO much in advance. Like genuinely so much. ",3,1754599108.0,8,MechanicAdvice,1754681587,2025-08-07 20:38:28,2025-08-08 19:33:07,"LandOfTheLostKek (Score: 1): Key battery?

Is this bad luck or a failure to be aware of?,"Friends of mine purchased a used 2022 Palisade a few months ago, which had routine service done to the vehicle (not neglected or extended oil changes or other maintenance, basically!).  They haven't had the oil changed yet since they've owned it less than 5,000 miles, but experienced a low oil pressure warning at highway speeds and loss of power.  By the time the oil light was on, it was too late, and Uncle Rodney and Team Glitter have come to visit.

They asked me to help them replace the engine and this is what I found when I noticed a significant oil leak coming from the oil filter housing.  I've never seen a failure like this before.  It was made worse by the oil filter housing facing downwards, allowing the oil to freely leak out via gravity alone.

The filter housing cap was fully tightened but it leaked past the o-ring,  The o-ring was broken in half but still round and flexible, so it was not an old, work hardened o-ring.  The filter installed was a Wix filter, so the o-ring may be a Wix o-ring but it's unknown. 

Is this just a bad luck failure of an o-ring at an inopportune time with a weirdly mounted oil filter housing?    Has anyone ever seen a failure like this before?

I have a 2012 buick verano 2.4l with p0011 intake cam code, active.

Caught these waveforms, blue is exhaust vvt solenoid and green is intake vvt solenoid. Measurement taken at the solenoid connectors. Not pictured is camshaft waveform which I found to be good, measurement was taken at the CMP connector.

Not pullers or races or any other special tools are used to deal with them. 

If they‚Äôre rusted into the knuckle a few whacks with a hammer gets them out. And if they‚Äôre really stuck, an air hammer will get it if you try to spin the flange in the socket. 

Dust shields help protect your rotors and keep debris from getting trapped against the pad lining. Might have to get official Ford parts‚Ä¶ not strictly speaking necessary, but worth pricing out before you move on.

Also water pump should be replaced due to a minor leak and at that stage I can change thermostat as well.

1mk57ii,2013 Kia Soul ! 97k struggling to start,"Hi all, I have a 2013 Kia Soul ! 2.0L w/o Smart Start  
Lately, I have been having trouble starting my engine, especially when it's raining or has rained for a couple of hours. I have about 97K miles on it, and I have tried checking the battery.

At times, it cranks, then sputters and dies; other times, if I hit the gas pedal, it starts.  
I have been jump-starting the car every time it dies ( 2 times this week), it's worked, but I don't know how long I can keep jump-starting it.

I've got a battery from AAA: 121R-C 600 CCA 100 RC for 2.8 years.

I tried testing it with a multimeter and charging the battery with a Noco Genius 5.  
Starting with both terminals removed from the battery: 12.5V engine off.  
Noco charged to 13.38V, removed the charger, let it sit for 10 mins, battery fell to 12.81 -> and then reattaching the terminals dropped the voltage to 12.65.  
I was able to start the car, 14.46V, 14.41V with headlights on, then turning the engine off, 12.6V.  
The next day (drizzled) tested the battery with the engine off, 12.38V.

About half a year ago check engine light went on, and with a scan tool, the code was P0303, cylinder 3 misfire, but that check engine light did go away after a week.

Any advice?  
Edit1: Should I take it to AAA and pay $150 to have it diagnosed?

About a week ago, emergency handbrake brake suddenly went completely slack when I engaged it. Disassembled the console area and this is what I see: Driver side cable significantly longer than passenger side, causing passenger side cable to slip out of equaliser when brake is raised more than about 3 clicks (1st pic).

Been wedging passenger cable back in place each time I need to park (pic 2) as short term fix. Before I take to garage again, I'm seeking advice on 3 things:

1)  Does longer driver side brake cable when disengaged suggest this is same issue as before (ie driver side EB is staying at least somewhat engaged even when handbrake is in 'off' position)?

2) Should the January repair have only lasted 1/2 a year? I work from home and only use car for 1-2 errands/week, so EB has only been engaged no more than 100 times times since it was fixed.

3) Is this is something a patient, methodical amateur could fix on their own with some jackstands, brake cleaner, grease etc? Been out of work for months so DIYing all I can to conserve savings.

You need to get a code scanner and pull the code, and depending on what it is, make a repair.

1mjzgmh,Diagnostic Tool Recommendation,"I'm not a mechanic by any means but I've more or less outgrown my BlueDriver.   Plus the BlueDriver screws with the computer on my 2007 Volvo S60.

I'm looking for something that will allow me to do things like dial back the parking brake on my wife's Subaru Ascent.  My latest issue was getting an ""ENGINE SYSTEM SERVICE REQUIRED"" message and not being able to do anything about it.  I had to bring it to my Volvo mechanic so he could plug in (he used a MaxiPRO MP900TS) and diagnose it.  Turns out the radiator fan had failed.  He tried to kick it on with the tool but it wouldn't kick on.  

I replaced the fan and I'm back in business.

Again, I'm no mechanic, but that's the kind of stuff I'd like to be able to do in my driveway.

  
Autel is having a sale right now and I've been looking at the MaxiCOM MK900BT for $530 shipped to my door.  I handed my mechanic $200 after he scanned it (not just for the scan, but for some unrelated diagnostics that he didn't want to take money for until we figured out... which we didn't...)  That $200 would've covered a good chunk of that MK900BT.

The only cheaper options are the MaxiCheck MX808S, MaxiCOM MK808Z, MaxiCOM MK808BT PRO, and MaxiCheck MX900.  Is there any reason why I SHOULDN'T go for one of these cheaper models as a backyard mechanic?  It looks like they all have bi-directional control which is really what I'm after.  I don't NEED the OBD plug to be bluetooth if the cable is long enough for me to use the tool while under the hood.  I also don't need wifi printing.  As long as I can see the screen, a pencil and paper work just fine for making notes.

  
Subscriptions/updates...  Do I have to pay to keep any of these devices current?  If I don't update the tool, does it become a brick?  I don't work in a shop where I'm going to see all makes and years of cars.  I'll be using the tool on my own vehicles, and maybe a friend's evey now and then.  I'd hate to spend $500+ on the tool, then $500+ or whatever every year just to keep it functional when I'm only working on the same three cars.

  
For reference, my vehicles are: 2023 Subaru Ascent, 2017 Chevy 3500HD Duramax, and 2007 Volvo S60.  My other cars are either OBDI or earlier.

Yesterday, after driving for about 15 minutes I was parked with the engine running for about 5-10 minutes with the AC on.

There‚Äôs a small optimistic change that you just had a giant amount of air in the system, maybe in your heater core, that got freed up when you adjusted the hvac.

When you open the coolant cap with the engine hot, the coolant instantly boils at the hottest parts of the engine and sends steam propelled coolant into your reservoir. Now there is a big air/steam bubble in the system. When it cools, it will suck the coolant up from the reservoir leaving it empty. If you only top up the reservoir and you don‚Äôt properly bleed the air from the system, you might never get all the air out.¬†

Monday (8/4) I got in my car after work and drove 1.1miles. I just got on the highway and heard something coming from the back right of my car, it got louder and louder and eventually pulled over to find a big gash in my tire.

Put the spare on and took a family member's car the next 2 days to work until I could get new tires Wednesday afternoon (8/6), I needed new soon tires anway. Got the 4 new tires and Wednesday night I drove around for about 2 hours (80 miles) and everything was fine.

Today, I drove to work as normal, and at the end of the day, found my back right tire (same one as the first time), fully deflated.

Is there a logical explaination to these events other than someone intentionally doing this? I work in a manufacturing facility as an engineer (200+ people in the facility total). I don't think I have any enemies but my manager said maybe it could be someone mad I fix their machines when they like to sit around and do nothing while the machines are broken.

1mjonpd,Need honest advice on a 1 755 CAD safety quote for my 2011 Ford Fusion (Ontario),"**Need honest advice on a 1 755 CAD safety quote for my 2011 Ford Fusion (Ontario)**

Hi everyone,

I feel pretty lost and could use some guidance from mechanics or anyone familiar with Ontario safety rules.  
I am a student at Western living on a tight budget and I just sold my old car, a **2011 Ford Fusion SE** (automatic, about **149 000 km**). Things have taken an unexpected turn.

---

## Background and recent work

* **Summer 2023 (Barrie)** ‚Äì Paid about **1 300 CAD** at a different shop to replace all four pads and rotors plus a caliper. After that I hardly drove the car because I was working for Rogers and used a company van most days.  
* **September 2023 ‚Äì April 2024** ‚Äì Moved to London for university. Western gives us a city transit pass so the Fusion sat in my parking spot most of the time.  
* **11 Apr 2024** ‚Äì Took the car to **Shop A** (leaving the name out for now) for a leaking transmission-fluid line. Paid **640 CAD**. The owner had the car on the lift, gave it a once-over, and said it was solid. He even asked me to leave a Google review (I did).  
* **Winter 2024-25** ‚Äì The car stayed in my garage, battery disconnected.  
* **14 Jun 2025** ‚Äì Jump-started it and went back to Shop A. Told the owner I planned to sell soon and asked **three separate times** if there was anything that would fail an Ontario safety. He said the battery was fine, nothing major showed up, and a certificate was optional. I sent him **200 CAD** for that inspection.  
* **29 Jul 2025** ‚Äì Sold the car for **3 600 CAD** to a dad buying it for his son. I felt confident and even pointed him back to Shop A for the safety certificate.  
* **7 Aug 2025** ‚Äì The buyer forwarded this written quote from the same shop:

4 control arms ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. 360
rear pads ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶  40
2 rear rotors ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..  80
windshield ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. 350
both rocker panels ‚Ä¶.. 350
labour ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. 400
safety inspection ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ 175

subtotal ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. 1 755

---

## Why I am confused

1. The pads and rotors are **less than two years old** and have maybe 7 000 km on them.  
2. If control arms and rocker panels were bad, why were they **not mentioned on 14 Jun** when I paid for an inspection specifically asking about safety issues?  
3. Shop A now tells me the June visit was only a quick visual 20-point look, even though I asked about safety three times and paid the fee.

---

## What I need help with

* Do the parts list and prices look fair for a 2011 Fusion in Ontario?  
* Would every item on that list actually cause a fail in a proper safety inspection?  
* What is a normal labour rate in London ON for this work?  
* Any advice on how the buyer and I should approach the shop for clarification or goodwill?  
* If the buyer pays for a second licensed safety inspection (about **60 to 120 CAD**) what is the best way to compare the two reports?

I can post redacted screenshots of the quote and my text messages if that helps.  
Thanks for reading.

Well I wanted to fully restore it to show room quality with a lot of customizations. I searched around for a while and found a shop that restores classic cars . They have 5 star reviews on Google and yelp and do really good work from everything I have seen. 

They were all excited and seemed super motivated. I paid them for an engine rebuild, body work, full paint job different color then original with inside of doors inside engine bay etc, with raptor liner in bed and on fender flares. The owner kept sending me constant updates and I went and saw the truck after they painted it and did body work and it looks amazing!

I kept bringing parts I bought to them for the restore new headlights, weather stripping, handles, grill, etc. just the usual for a full restoration. It kept coming along. Well about 4 weeks ago I went to see the owner to drop off my new headlights and he was his usual self and showed me the truck and it was beautiful. 

We shoot the shit for a little while and he shows me some cool cars in his shop. When I‚Äôm leaving he shakes my hand and says ‚Äúthe truck should be done on Wednesday‚Äù this was a Friday. The engine was out and he was getting it back from the machine shop that weekend and installing it. So I was like cool. I‚Äôm really in no rush. 

Like an idiot I pay all the money up front ($21k) instead of paying half and waiting to pay the other half when I was done. But I trusted him and they have perfect 5 star reviews and I have seen some super awesome work they have done. I will never do that again.

Well that next Wednesday rolls around and I haven‚Äôt heard anything and I just give him a call and check it. He instantly has a different vibe and gets super snappy and just seemed different and disconnected. Like just a whole other energy. I asked him if we were still on for me getting it back. 

He starts just rolling a bunch of vague reasons a million miles an hour. He said it was still misfiring and they had to take the engine out and send it back to the machine shop. I tell him it‚Äôs all good I‚Äôm not in a rush. Well after that point he has just acted not interested and super short. 

He used to call me and talk for like 20-30mins and joke and BS with me. I had to bring other parts by and he would just never return my calls or text me back. I waited 2 weeks and called him again just to ask for an update and he finally answered and said ‚Äújust waiting on the machine shop.‚Äù So I was like ok no big deal.

But it just all felt weird and had just a weird not passionate anymore energy. Like he was just trying to completely ignore me. So today since I haven‚Äôt had any updates I went by the shop to drop off parts and talk to him. He wasn‚Äôt there but his employees were. 

I ask where he was and they were acting weird and said they didn‚Äôt know. I asked them if I could see my truck because I wanted to look at something. They said it wasn‚Äôt there. I asked them why it wasn‚Äôt there. They said the whole truck is at the machine shop because they wanted to diagnose the whole truck since it was still misfiring. 

No one ever told me once they were going to move my truck any where. The employees were being shady hiding something. I feel like I have good intuition and my radar was just going off. They were acting like they were trying to call him and text him and told me he didn‚Äôt answer. 

I then asked what machine shop it was at and they told me they didn‚Äôt know only the owner knew. I‚Äôm like why would the owner be the only person that knew what machine shop they used. I instantly just got a bad feeling. I told them I would keep calling the owner and pop back up to the shop soon. 

The owners phone I call is their main shop line so I know he is answering the phone for the shop. I call him right when I leave and leave a polite but firm voicemail and said ‚ÄúHey man I just want to know what machine shop has my truck so I just don‚Äôt want to be left in the dark‚Äù never got a call back. I also text him the same thing. 

I recorded the whole conversation with my phone in my pocket. Just to document. Am I overreacting? I‚Äôm just paranoid something is wrong because no communication and the weird shift in energy. Also my whole truck being moved without me knowing. When he told me they were pulling the engine again to send it. Is this standard practice? 

The silence makes me uncomfortable. I just want communication. For his own sake he should have just blew smoke yo my ass. ‚ÄúHey man sorry they are backlogged and it may be a month or two.‚Äù But I‚Äôm telling you a weird short snappy full of excuses energy.

I recently got my license as a young adult and I‚Äôm starting to think seriously about getting my own car. I learned to drive on an older Subaru and currently borrow a family member‚Äôs Audi Q7 whenever I need to go somewhere.

I really like the Audi‚Äôs features, especially the cameras, the obstacle/collision detection (the beeping‚Ä¶ forgive me), and the comfortable/modern feel of it. That being said, I‚Äôm not looking for a high-performance sports car or a super high-end exotic luxury vehicle.

I have no preference for gas versus electric.  I suppose a hybrid would be ideal, considering my family has an EV charger in our garage.  I know it‚Äôs compatible with teslas- not sure about other EVs.

Any recommendations for makes/models that hit that sweet spot of reliability, safety, and a refined feel?

There's a few ways to test the switch with an electronic multimeter or test light, or you could make one of these ignition switch bypasses, plug it directly into the switch connector, and bypass the ignition switch altogether.

1mk6wyc,In desperate need of some help with my AC,"My compressor died on my '17 civic.  I changed it out along with the expansion valve and the condensor.  I drained the compressor through the drain port and refilled it with 3.5oz of oil through the suction port, per the Honda service manual.  I flushed the lines and the evaporator indivodually.

 Vacuumed it down to -25 (all the pump would pull) and let it sit for 30 min to leak check the system.  30 minutes later it's still holding -25 hg.  I vacuumed it for another 45 minutes and then recharged it.  The system holds 15 oz of 1234yf.  Crank the car up, purge the input  line on the gages and crack the low side slowly before opening it all the way up. Car starts pulling in refrigerant.  The compressor kicks on and the low side gage drops then comes back up, climbing to about 60 hg, at which point it stops pulling  refrigerant, but only about 3 ozs.  At this point the low side and the high side are equalized. 

This has happened twice to me.  First time I figured I got a bum compressor so I swapped it out and the expansion valve.  But its done the exact same thing to me the second time.

I would not drive the car like this especially a long trip as your exhaust valves open too early which will have combustion flames going through them and could even burn the exhaust manifold gasket, which is then not going to be a quick fix by any comparison.


First check if the VVT solenoid is working as intended, unplug it get it on a bench and apply either 12V through it from a car battery or alternatively use a 9V battery and see if it clicks open. You can try cleaning it with a cleaning solution like MAF cleaner while having it click rapidly, and then apply some lubricating oil spray on it and continue clicking it.


If it looks like its working then it could also be a stuck VVT adjuster sprocket or if lucky a failed cam sensor(impropable but possible). Good luck"

1mjqcrk,Question about switching mechanics mid-job,"Looking for a reality check on my car and the business of mechanics.

So on Wednesday of last week the Check Engine light came on in my 2014 Mazda 3. The engine has been surging while idling, going up to about 3k rpms, then back down to 1k, and repeating. If I leave it in drive, sometimes it will attempt to lurch forward, so I've been shifting into neutral when stopped at lights. After filling the tank that same day, the car had trouble starting, but finally turned over.

My normal mechanic is on vacation, and I was able to get it over to another local shop that gets good reviews for being very ethical -- not overcharging and being really honest. When they plugged it in, the code was:

* P0171 - Fuel Trim System Too Lean (Failure Type 00)

I left the car there and biked to work for the rest of the week. On Friday I talked with the mechanic and he said that they'd tried any number of things to try to pinpoint the cause, checking and cleaning valves and such, but they were unable to figure out the cause. He definitely comes off as someone who enjoys a challenge!

He said that the car was fine to drive and that I should come pick it up and drive it for a while and see if anything else starts to happen that might happen that could help him pinpoint the cause. He didn't charge me anything.

So I drove it over the long weekend and today on my way home, the car started shaking as I was driving. Not violently, but pretty consistently. It's subtle when driving, but very noticeable when idling. I drove it right over to the shop and it now had two codes

* P0171 - Fuel Trim System Too Lean

* PO451 - Fuel Tank Pressure Sensor: Sensor Characteristic Malfunction

The mechanic took it for a spin for about 5-10 minutes, and said that there wasn't anything that gave him more information, that the car was still safe to drive, and encouraged me to drive it more before bringing it back.

**That brings me to my questions:**

* **Does the car indeed seem safe to drive?**

* **I might be able to get my car into another shop tomorrow or Friday would it be inappropriate to do so, given the work this one shop has done for no pay? Do you think another shop might be faster, or would they end up doing all of the same work this shop has already done?**

[Serious] I got hit with a $3,400 ($2,900) estimate out of nowhere and feel sick. The quote was something I overheard while waiting in between the first and second estimate. Hilarious and so accurate.

I could really use some honest advice here. I‚Äôm single 34F who lost both of my parents in the last few years. I‚Äôve been doing my best to keep up with life and responsibilities, but shits hard. Now I feel like I‚Äôm just trying to navigate it all blindly, and I really don‚Äôt want to get taken advantage of.

I drive a 2018 BMW 330i xDrive with 75k miles. It‚Äôs garage-kept, and since I work from home, I don‚Äôt drive it much. I bought it three years ago when it came off lease, and for the first year or two I took it to the dealership for maintenance ‚Äî just oil changes and routine stuff. No major issues so far.

Today, I took it to a local shop I had used once before for oil / rear brakes. That first visit was great, and they had a perfect rating on Google, so I felt like it was my go-to place I could trust. What I didn‚Äôt realize is that they‚Äôve since changed ownership, and the vibe was completely different this time.

I made an appointment for an oil change and to check on the front brakes. After waiting, a service guy called me into the garage where the tech asked how long I planned to keep the car. I wasn‚Äôt sure ‚Äî as long as I can, really. He told me it needed spark plugs and some other ‚Äúregular maintenance,‚Äù but nothing serious. I felt relieved.

Back at the desk, the advisor said he‚Äôd ‚Äúhook me up with a good deal‚Äù and asked if I wanted the work done. I said yes ‚Äî as long as they could do it in one day ‚Äî because I have to drive out of town in two days. (Looking back, I think telling them I was on a time crunch was probably my first mistake.)

While waiting, I looked up spark plug intervals and pricing, just trying to learn. When the estimate finally came out, the first page said $1,300 ‚Äî which was more than I expected, but manageable. Then I saw the second page‚Ä¶ $3,500 total. I was stunned. Nothing on it looked major enough to justify that number ‚Äî everything just seemed inflated.

I couldn‚Äôt drop thousands unexpectedly. Instead of explaining the charges, he just kept asking, ‚ÄúWell, how much were you looking to spend today?‚Äù Which felt shady. I didn‚Äôt come in with a budget ‚Äî I came in for an oil change. I questioned the rotation as it‚Äôs usually comped. After a few back-and-forths, he said he‚Äôd ‚Äútalk to his boss‚Äù and magically shaved off $1,000. That felt like a huge red flag. 

While I was waiting, I found a dealership invoice from last year showing I already had the spark plugs replaced ‚Äî and at a lower cost. When I showed it to him, he seemed surprised and said it must‚Äôve been just an estimate. I showed him proof of payment. Then he started saying, ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs not on Carfax,‚Äù and even claimed that not reporting it was illegal. I didn‚Äôt know better at the time, but I looked it up later ‚Äî not true. At that point, it was clear they were just trying to justify the estimate, and my gut was screaming that I was being played.

Eventually, I told them I‚Äôd just pay for the oil change and think about it. They didn‚Äôt like that ‚Äî at all. One guy even tried to snatch the original estimate from my hands when I asked for a copy, but I held onto it. Super awkward and honestly kind of alarming. Thankfully, I left with both estimates in hand so I could compare them later.

I plan to take my car to another shop tomorrow for a second opinion. I just want it to be safe, but I also need to be smart with money right now. I know some work might need to be done ‚Äî I‚Äôm not trying to get out of maintaining my car ‚Äî but this whole situation left me feeling gross and confused.

FWIW I'm a little confused on the whole 1 vs 2 thing you have going on but the best thing to do for your sake is look at your manual and find the service intervals and use that as a guide. 

I would also recommend looking up how to do very minor things yourself like the air filters. Don't buy the cheapest air filters out there - wix is a good aftermarket brand - but certainly they should be fairly easy to DIY. 

The transmission fluid change isn't a bad idea at 75k just find a better shop - I'd expect more in the range of $300. Not sure what BMW recommends but I've always done them much earlier than recommended. 75k would be pushing it on my personal interval.

1mjmg71,Safe to drive on bad struts for the next month and a half?,"Hello,

So I have slowly been working through a hollow clunking noise on my 2015 Toyota Sienna XLE FWD.

I‚Äôm pretty confident that it is a suspension issue. I have replaced the following components on both sides:

*Sway Bar Links and Bushings
*Lower Control Arms
*Ball Joints 
*Outer Tie Rods

I have also replaced my front left (driver‚Äôs) side CV axle for different reasons. While replacing the above parts the boot was ripped and I stripped the bolt end. Fun times when doing things on your own. 

The hollow clunking has persisted. Today I think it was finally confirmed that I need to replace the struts. I was traveling around 15-20 mph and noticed the hollow clunking every time I went over a slight bump in the road. There were times where it didn‚Äôt happen but was pretty consistent. Anything over 20 mph there was not a noticeable noise. 

When I got home I did check everything out to make sure nothing was loose. 

I have also noticed the nose-diving and squatting has progressed. 

Due to time and finances I have about 6 weeks or so before I can do the repairs. I‚Äôm going to purchase quick struts and get it done. 

My question is‚Ä¶.if I take it easy can they last that long? Most of my driving is highway driving at 60 plus mph.

Thank you!

KimiKimikoda (Score: 3): I recently bought an Up for similar money. A few things to look for:

- They are susceptible to rust in the wheel arches, but also around the fuel filler cap from behind the body panel (you'll see bubbling under the paint). 

- The soundproofing between the transmission tunnel and the cabin is pretty poor so the gearbox is quite vocal. The idler gear is generally a bit poor, so you may hear a rattle unless the clutch is in, and a clicking noise when you've changed gear. If it does that, your thought may be that the clutch is on the way out, but this was a fairly common issue with the Up. Better to live with it than chase a fix for it, it's more a series of production choices than a fault. 

- The 3 cylinder engine is also fairly rattly by default. Check that the timing belt has been done at around 50,000 - 60,000 miles. 

- Get underneath and poke around for rust. Surface rust is to be expected on the rear crossmember especially, bring a screwdriver and check the structure. 

- Steering racks can wear out, so check how the steering wheel sits. If it's straight, you're good. If it's angled, this may be a repair that needs doing at some point.

Now all sorted and price of vehicle restored! Thanks again!  


In 2022, I bought an Audi TT from Cazoo on finance (through Black Horse). At the time, the car was advertised as having a full service history and that was a non-negotiable condition for me. I wouldn‚Äôt have gone ahead with the purchase otherwise. 

Now, I‚Äôm trying to sell the car via Motorway and they‚Äôve flagged that the car doesn't have a full service history, because it was first registered in September 2019, but the first recorded service wasn‚Äôt until March 2021 at 9,598 miles. It took Cazoo 3 months post purchase of the vehicle to provide this service history as it was stored within the DSR, the timing of the service suggests a missed first service and breaks the FSH claim but for whatever reason this didn't click that it wasn't within the first 12 months, I just saw 9,598 miles and thought great, it's ahead of the 10,000 miles.

Cazoo has since gone bust, so I can‚Äôt go back to them. I‚Äôve contacted Black Horse but it could take 5 days for them to come back to me.

Still, I‚Äôm now facing a lower resale value because of the service history issue, and I feel misled and financially disadvantaged because the car wasn‚Äôt as described but I do need to accept that this could be my own fault for lack of due diligence.

I can‚Äôt find the original Cazoo listing as their emails they sent to me when I reserved the car had a link to a site that no longer exists but I know 100% it said FSH. I‚Äôve also asked Audi UK for a service printout and I‚Äôm trying to gather more records.

Do you need ground clearance? If you do, or you're happy to have an SUV, then you have a WEALTH of choice. The ""taller"" cars like Jimny/rav4 give you more but pretty much every aspect of them costs more to run than an ordinary car which happens to have 4x4. Obviously avoid the (huge numbers of!) cheap old Land Rovers unless you like waiting for recovery and hate money.

You might find it instructive to open autotrader and select ""4wd"" as an option (filter and sort -> drive type -> 4wd) then see what comes up. Sadly the only EV options are basically old Teslas and iPaces which are the opposite of reliable and ""cheap as possible to run"".

If you want reliable and cheap to run in a \*car\* then you're in the Suzuki world - so long as you don't need automatic - both the Swift and Ignis are available with a decent 4x4 system.   
  
They're both ""basic"" inside but (particularly the Swift) will last a loooooong time especially if you rise the salt off them. I've a slight preference for the pre/non-hybrid ones but I doubt the hybrids will turn out particularly problematic.

I ruled out the Yaris Cross because although it's likely to be supremely reliable and cheap (using whole-of-life cost as measure not just purchase price and fuel) the rear motor is extremely weedy - its performance in proper snow is pretty lamentable.

You could also look at the Panda 4x4 - note the 2-cyl petrol is dreadfully inefficient on fuel - and the good old Duster 4x4 (1.5dCi is best). The Dusters are absolute buttons to buy a few years old (comparatively) and the 1.5dCi is decently reliable for a modern diesel. They continuously improved it between years so newer is better; the main issue with old Dusters is rot. I wouldn't touch the new hybrid and I'd rather not have the Adblue version of the diesel.

Whatever you get, budget for proper winter tyres. I just leave them on all year round and accept accelerated wear and worse performance in summer because I'm too lazy to change them and don't do enough miles to care. You could also get a second set of rims off a scrapper if you have a garage for them.

In terms of the driving experience after a map, its great. Biggest improvement is throttle response, car just feels so much more flexible and the power is great too. Fuel economy is honestly not much worse, i noticed about a 2-4mpg drop at most.

TeaDependant (Score: 1): Q plate means of undetermined identity or age. Ford have good records, so it would be easy to identify the age through the VIN. Imports usually end up on age related plates.

Something has happened to make its identity uncertain, usually this is not a positive story on such new vehicles. Realistically, no one is going through the effort of importing a Kuga and messing it up enough to end up on a Q plate and the value loss from it.

You'll want insurance companies that specialise in non-mainstream cars like kit cars, etc. Adrian Flux used to do them, the likes of Footman James usually do classics on Q plates but may do a modern vehicle."

1mju7q6,Advice for buying a used (or new?) car - in a sellers market,"My girlfriend is looking to buy a new car, so I'm posting this on her behalf. It seems the used car market is crazy at the moment (particularly in the South East, and when factoring in ULEZ compatible cars). She'd really appreciate any advice people would give for her to get a car with the following criteria.

\- Budget of around ¬£5000  
\- Probably a hatchback but she also likes SUVs   
\- Good(ish) fuel economy, as it'll primarily be used to drive medium length distances (30 mins - 2hr) to visit friends and family  
\- She's driven for 10+ years, so insurance isn't really a big problem  
\- She's not too bothered about the best specs (so a 1.4ish mid range model would be fine) although would like cruise control and bluetooth  
\- ULEZ compatible  
\- She has a decent monthly income, so could get a loan or even a car on finance, but would like to try to avoid that unless it is the best option - she doesn't want to be in a 3/4 year commitment

She was looking at Golfs (I actually posted on here before), but I feel like they're not a great deal at the moment.

Hatchbacks
- Mazda 3 1.5 Skyactiv G

- Volvo V40 1.6 D2

Suv's are hard to recommend at this price point 
Can't really go wrong with a Honda CRV 1.6 I-Dtec. A qashqai 1.5DCi is usually a good option too but depends on condition and I'd be wary of any at ¬£5k 

The Civic diesel would be my pick. Engine is bulletproof nice and quiet at high speeds with plenty of pulling power and is capable of nearly 70mpg on a long run. You'll get the same engine in the CRV but it's not as fuel efficient due to the added weight. Mazda 2 would be a very close second. 

The v60 Volvo is superb! I had one for a few months  Does everything the civic does but feels nicer in every way. The only reason it's not first on my list as I'm not sure how well that 1.6 engine holds up with miles and age.

Again bare in mind most of what you'll be looking at will be 10+ years old buy based on condition and choose wisely. 

You mentioned she makes a decent income so my advice would be  to Keep saving. Around ¬£8k is what you need these days to get something fairly new (6 to 8 years old)

1mjtprt,Company car buyout / allowance,"Hi there, I currently own my own private car, as well as a company car through the BIK (Benefit in Kind) scheme. This company car costs me approximately ¬£1500 each year out of pocket, which is then deducted from my salary as tax.

The business has offered me the option to switch to a car buyout scheme. In this scheme, the company car would return to them, and I would receive an additional ¬£400 or so each month. This extra money could be used to cover the running costs of my personal car or to lease or purchase another vehicle.

The dilemma I‚Äôm facing is whether to return the company car, accept the extra month, and either use my own car or buy another.

However, buying a second car would mean I‚Äôd have to handle insurance, tax, MOT, and other associated costs myself. I‚Äôve already received a few insurance quotes for cars worth ¬£1,000 to ¬£2,000, including some old Volvos, Saabs, and BMWs. The insurance quotes have come to around ¬£1,300, which is more than I anticipated, especially considering that I currently pay ¬£400 for my personal car.

I‚Äôm hoping someone can offer some advice on this decision. Thanks in advance!

If im not mistaken, the allowance would be taxed on whatever bracket you are on.  You should work out how much extra it would be after tax (assuming the 400 is pre tax), add ¬£125 (1500/12) and that is how much extra you can spend to be in the same position you are currently in financial wise.

From a financial perspective if you own your car outright and it's a boring shitbox then take the money you'll have more take home.

I've been looking mostly at PHEV's like a Golf GTE or a BMW 330e, they would suit my daily commute as I could use the electric most days in the week and then have the engine to do the occasional long journey on the weekend. I would say I'm doing about 15 miles a day on average and could charge up the battery at work, just by running a lead into a regular outlet. I'm not opposed to going back to a straight petrol, its what I'm used to and would probably be a bit cheaper. I am also open to the idea of potentially going fully electric, but garaunteeing a spot outside my house can be tricky and after looking online public electric chargers seems really expensive.

Are you likely to stay at the same workplace and with this arrangement lasting in the long run? Look at this with clear eyes - when work colleagues see you getting free power while they pay for petrol, are they likely to be envious and cause trouble?

This is not a personal attack on OP, it's something they need to consider carefully.

Any kind of EV without home charging is a disaster for most people - unless they have special circumstances like ""free power at work"".

Personally I'm not a fan of most PHEVs as I think they add weight and complexity for an economy gain that is very marginal over a good non-plug-in hybrid. If I \*had\* a modern RAV4 or the new Prius I'd plug it in rather than not, but if you're paying daytime rate for power then it's not \*that\* much cheaper than petrol anyway.

I've not had either but I've read of expensive issues with both Golf/Passat GTE and BMW PHEVs. I'd rather own a simple Japanese car if I had to own something out of warranty.

fisherthemkek (Score: 1): Although not great for acceleration, but for the mileage you do, a self-charging (mild hybrid) would probably suit you best. I'd recommend having a look at auris/newer corollas. They're very popular amongst taxi drivers for the same reason you're probably looking for a hybrid: reliability and consumption. Alternatively, if budget allows, basically any Lexus would do the job, (same as toyotas) most are self-charging.
Speaking from experience: my partner's 16 plate hybrid auris has a better mpg than my 1.5 tdci focus which does 53mpg.
Yes, it's incredibly boring to drive once the ""honeymoon"" period wears off, but it is extremely reliable and so far very good for our pockets as well.
