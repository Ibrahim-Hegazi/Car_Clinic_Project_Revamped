I’ve been experiencing a range of dashboard lights the last few days— I drive a 2004 Toyota Highlander V6.

When I am driving and have my foot on the brake, the right turn signal blinks rapidly and both the drive and reverse lights go on. In addition, my check engine/VSC/Trac lights are also on. Occasionally, the ABS and parking brake light go on too. The bulbs are correct and the lights all work.

My mechanic ran a diagnostic and pulled the codes P0705, C1223, and C1249.

He thought the problem was corrosion in the taillight, so he cleaned it up but the problem persists (though sometimes it runs with no dash lights.) He recommended the next step is to replace the taillight sockets.

What other sources could be causing this problem?

Does anyone have any advice on how to get this screw out? I've tried to go in through the back panel of my car as well and couldn't access the screw...

For context: 2015 Toyota Rav 4 

Shop up the street trying to charge me $140 to take it out with no guarantee that they'll get it out smh. 

Thanks in advance!!

1n2q3d7,Leaking ac hose,"I finally found the leak that has been causing a hissing sound. I attempted to pull a vacuum, and it wouldn't hold, straight back to 0 after turning the pump off. I attempted to add a can of refrigerant with dye to see if I could find a leak, and I at least got the readings on the gauges to go up a little. I then started to hear a hissing sound I heard last year when trying to recharge on my own. I'm sure that's when the hissing initially started. There had to have been a leak before that tho and that's why i was trying to recharge. At that time, the ac worked for months and then would only work for an hour or so before blowing warm air. Let the car sit from an hour to as long as overnight, and the ac would be back blowing cold for an hour or so again before going back to warm, but that's another story. 

So I got under my car and rubbed around on the compressor and hoses and found there was a tear on one of the hoses that came out of the condenser to the compressor. Happy I found it! I initially thought it was near the firewall and could have possibly been the evaporator core.

Anyway, what could be the reason I only feel air when placing my hand against the torn part of the hose? Shouldn't it be leaking with refrigerant? When I point the black light at it, I can see it glowing green but only on the inside of the hose, on the mesh/net looking part. None leaking on the outside. So, where's the refrigerant going? Or am I missing something or not understanding something about how this works? Maybe me manually pouring the dye in through the low side hose on the manifold gauge has something to do with it? What's the reason for only air if refrigerant is supposed to leak in the form of liquid/oil?

Note: The hissing sound only lasts but so long. Maybe like a minute before it stops from refrigerant running out, so I had to move fast after adding the can of refrigerant.

1n2nzw4,No start after Throttle Body Rebuild?,"1987 GMC Vandura G2500 5.0L 305

Little background: this is my friends van who recently passed away, it was running rather fine after replace starter and battery (sat for a year) also changed gas and oil before I drove it about 200 miles to where I'm working on it. On my way up I blew a radiator hose and overheated (engine cut off) about halfway to my destination. I replaced the hose on the side of the interstate and drove it the rest of the way (idle was a little Shakey after that, but it started up and drove the rest of the way with virtually no problems, though check engine light came on after this). Got it here and the first thing I did was put new gaskets and cleaned the throttle body. I replaced the TPS and the IAC valve. Was going to replace temp gauge sender unit and thermostat but I haven't gotten to it yet. After putting everything together I tried starting it, it turned over but it didn't start. Jumped the diagnostic port to check codes, but it only spits a constant code 12 (not just the first few times, constantly). The new IAC also makes a consistent gentle buzzing sound when the pins are jumped.
And ideas as to what could be going wrong? I know it's getting gas, I just bought this IAC so I guess it could be a faulty part or something?

During the first inspection, they never mentioned the rotors at all, only the pads. Now I’m being told it’s necessary to do both at once. I’m not sure if this is good advice or just upselling.
I’ve attached some photos of my rotors (see below). Could you please tell me if they really look like they need to be replaced now, or if it’s fine to just do the pads? I know the pictures may not be perfect since the wheels are still on and I can’t take everything apart, but I hope they’re clear enough to give an idea.
Thanks a lot for your help!

1n2lwa7,Low oil warning on Evoque 2016 – engine or pump?,"Hi everyone,
I own a 2016 Range Rover Evoque Turbo Diesel with ~150,000 km (about 93k miles) and I’ve been struggling with a strange low oil warning issue.

The first time it happened was about 9 months ago: while going downhill I got a warning on the dash saying “engine oil level extremely low.” The light went away immediately after the curve. I pulled over, checked the oil level and it was perfectly fine. After leaving the car parked for a couple of hours and restarting it, the warning never came back… until much later.

About 8,000 km later, again while going downhill, the same warning popped up. Since then, here’s what has happened:
	•	The warning only appears when the engine is fully warm and running at very low RPMs (like braking downhill or stopping).
	•	I had the oil pressure sensor replaced → warning still shows up.
	•	The shop also tried thicker oil, thinking maybe the oil pump was weak at hot idle → no improvement.

Now, the shop insists the problem is internal to the engine (possibly piston rings or internal pressure loss) and told me the only real solution is to replace the entire engine. They even discouraged me from trying to replace the oil pump, saying it would be a waste of money.

Honestly, I’m not convinced. To me it feels more like an oil pump issue, or maybe something related to the pickup, seals, or oil circulation, rather than the whole engine being done for.

My question:
Has anyone with an Evoque (or similar Land Rover engines) experienced this? Does it really sound like an engine replacement issue, or could it still be the oil pump or something else in the lubrication system?

Any advice or shared experiences would be super helpful before I even think about replacing the whole engine.

Thanks a lot! 🙏",1,1756409616.0,5,MechanicAdvice,1756496014,2025-08-28 19:33:36,2025-08-29 19:33:34,"Minimum_Shame2224 (Score: 1): Did you at least check for leaks first?

Currently, the Jeep has a service light that comes back as a faulty High Pressure Switch (?). This time the vehicle was brought to the Jeep dealership for service where they did tests Ave found that particular part being faulty. They said the valve body had to be replaced, to which my in-laws approved the repair and they began work. The pan was dropped and they noticed red fluid in the transmission. They stopped work and opened up a STAR case (?) with Chrysler. They will now not work on the Jeep stating the fluid is not the correct fluid and they need to buy a new transmission to the tune of $11k+. I’ve spoken with the mechanic that put the fluid in and he swears it’s approved, but cannot provide proof. Chrysler says it’s absolutely the wrong fluid. Vehicle now has 29k miles. The symptoms when the light came on was it wouldn’t shift from park to drive or reverse intermittently. 

My questions:
-Is the BG fluid the wrong fluid?
-Is the transmission likely toast as Chrysler is saying?
-Should we just replace the valve body and put in the approved fluid and send it. 
-Should I pursue the mechanic should it be deemed the wrong fluid was actually put in?

1n2esop,Catalytic converter install,"Hello everyone, I recently bought a Honda Accord 2014 2.4L. The previous owner removed the catalytic converter to 'improve' the exhaust noise. The car has been pretty reliable, but it is throwing a P0420 code CEL code because of the non existent catalytic converter. As I live in a state which does not require emissions testing, the catalytic converter isn't a 'need' for me but I was still thinking to get it installed because the CEL annoys me. I have two questions regarding this issue. 
1) how much does a it cost to get a catalytic converter installed ( parts + labor)? I'll probably get a cheap one installed. I live in the Midwest. 

2) If I do not get a catalytic converter installed, is there a way to not get the CEL for the P0420 code?",1,1756393614.0,3,MechanicAdvice,1756496014,2025-08-28 15:06:54,2025-08-29 19:33:34,"newtekie1 (Score: 1): Luckily, the cat on your car is literally just a bolt on piece of the exhaust. The bad thing is you live in the midwest, so salt is a thing, and the bolts might not come out easy. Luckily on your car the bolts you need to remove are up in the engine bay and not down under the car. But it is still a relative easy job. This is assuming the previous owner didn't do something stupid like cut the flange off and weld a straight pipe in place of the cat. You can buy the CAT itself off rockauto for under $300. A mechanic would probably charge you 1-2 hours of labor to put it on assuming the flange is still there. But a lot of mechanics won't put on cats that the customer supplies. So that might be a hurdle you face.

On some cars you can get the CEL to go away by tuning it out of the ECU so the P0420 code doesn't cause the CEL to come on. But this isn't legal, and obviously if you ever sell the car and don't tell them about it, it's fraud. Also they make spacers you can put on the rear O2 sensor that will trick the sensor into reading like there is a CAT and sometimes that is enough to get the P0420 to go away. Again, don't sell the car like this."

1n2edrm,Jetta Manual Trans TDI Clutch Issue? Help Appreciated!,"
2013 Jetta Sportwagon 6MT Stage 2 Malone 145k miles. Everything working fine until yesterday on the highway I shifted down to 5th to pass and revs shot up with almost zero acceleration, eventually acceleration goes back to ""normal"". Since then it seems to be getting worse rapidly, as soon as I hit 2-3000 rpms revs fly up super fast with little actual acceleration and then odd gauge fluctuations until the gauges settles down to where it normally should be. Seems to be worse in 4th and 5th, but now 2nd and 3rd are getting there. But even on the highway in 6th, if I push the pedal too hard it shoots up to 3-3500 until catching, it feels like. And this is happening without flooring, just regular light pressure on the gas when shifting.

Is this the clutch failing rapidly out of nowhere? Or vacuum leak? DMF? I'm just a light mechanic (do my own oil, fuel filter, removed and cleaned the anti shutter when it was gunked close, caused limp mode, a couple months ago, replaced upper and lower control arms on my truck). How can I pinpoint this issue, and can I keep driving? I have VCDS if I can use that. If it is the clutch, does the DMF come with that assembly or should I do that while things are apart, since I know thats a common issue. There is a lot of hills where I live, I bought the car at 120k and I do beat on her on the 120 mi a day commute. Just wondering if it's definitely the clutch or not?

My wife just got her rotors, calipers, pads, left axle, and sway bar links replaced before baby arrival (yayy).

1. Brought it back to the mechanic and they said the caliper was seizing, and was replaced. 
2. Brought it back again and this time they said it was the other caliper, and was replaced. 
3. Brought it back again and this time they rebalanced a tire. Just one though..

Then I brought it to Sandy Lane because I was frustrated and still felt the vibration. They're a highly reputable local mechanic and I had no doubt they would find whatever was causing this issue. 
They found that the rebalanced tire was overweighed by 2.5 ounces (ouch) so they rebalanced all the tires and said it was good to go. 

..I still feel vibrations..

Now here's what I did today.. 
I raised the car, and decided to keep the tires on this time (I also put some blocking below the control arms for extra support).
In the attached video, I've started the car and you will notice that the rotor binds up 1/4 way through the turn. I also noticed that the engine ""sputters"" or ""hiccups"" when I apply the brake pedal (firmly).

When I went to buy my 2017 Hyundai Veloster, the spare tire compartment was full of some kind of oil. The dealership told me it must have been someone pouring it in (they said the car had been repossessed and maybe a disgruntled owner did it), because “there’s no way it could come from anywhere in the actual car.”

They cleaned it out at the time and detailed it, but now it’s slowly filling up again. I brought it back to them again today and they told me again, it’s likely contamination filling back up.

•	The liquid is thick and oily, not watery or thin like gas.
•	It doesn’t smell like gasoline.
•	It feels like engine oil or hydraulic oil.
•	There aren’t any obvious leaks under the car around the fuel tank.

Is there any possible way oil can actually get into the spare tire well on these cars, or is this just leftover contamination slowly seeping back out of the sound deadening/seam sealer?

The only way I can think of that you might get water intrusion in the drivetrain is if seals are in horrible shape and you got water through there, or if you were deep enough it got water in some sort of vent on things. You'd have to be a decent way up your body to get high enough to reach anything susceptible to that though.

Also the another reason would be the dealer , he also play the big role in the price , some add the handling fees , insurance variation , or optional accessories, which can slightly increase the final price of the Bajaj Chetak , another reason would be the local demand in the area , cities like Delhi , Mumbai , Bangalore etc 
Where people started ev adoption in their daily life , prices might be competitive , while in rural areas limited availability could lead to higher price

If the broken off screw is not accessible from the back, you will have to center punch and drill out the screw.

Use lots of oil/penetrant while drilling. Hope this helps!"

1n2qehy,Need help with emissions testing rejection.,"2015 Chrysler 200C V6 AWD, with intake mods and both an engine and tranny tune via HP tuners. I have a Cold AIr Intake, a 80mm Hemi throttle body (with adapter) and a performance lower intake manifold. I also have a wideband O2 sensor and am currently using only 93 octane gas. With all this like this it passed the previous emissions testing two years ago. Now I suddenly have an issue.  I am also using ruthenium plugs but am not sure if I put them in before or after the previous emissions test. 

I took it to the emissions testing a few weeks ago and it was rejected. This is what the sheet is telling me: *Your vehicle rejected today due to incomplete readiness monitors. Incomplete monitors: Fuel, Oxygen, Catalyst.*

The car runs fine and I drive it daily. I went through the guy who did the tune and I sent him the read and he said the rear catalytic converters weren't added, but the last tune I added was prior to the previous emissions test and it passed just fine. He updated the tune and I wrote it to the car then took it in today to have it retested. This time they told me one of the errors was cleared but it was still rejected and this is what it was rejected for: *Your vehicle rejected today due to incomplete readiness monitors. Incomplete monitors: Fuel, Evap, Oxygen, Catalyst.* None of the issues cleared and *Evap* was added which is odd considering they said one was cleared. 

Like I said the car runs fine (if not great) and no engine codes or anything like that. **Not exactly sure what to look at here.**

Both the Emissions tech and my tune guy told me that I need to do a **basic drive cycle**, which I have never heard of before (been driving now for about 40 years). In fact I have replaced the battery in my car, had a battery cable come off (over 8hrs) while the car was off and have done work on my car where I had to remove the battery many times and I have never had an issue passing the emissions test previously. I also did a general search for my car's drive cycle and several different things came up but not one of them match another.

If a drive cycle is what is needed then is there a way to clear this without needing to do a basic drive cycle (whatever it is for this car)? Consequently I drive back and forth to work every day with it being about 15-20 mins each way. I travel various speeds from 25mph to 80mph (side roads and an interstate) with stop signs and traffic lights all along the way, and I am occasionally in stop and go traffic.",0,1756420361.0,10,autorepair,1756496014,2025-08-28 22:32:41,2025-08-29 19:33:34,"Whyme1962 (Score: 3): Are you clearing codes before taking it in for testing?

1n2q62v,Leaking ac hose,"I finally found the leak that has been causing a hissing sound. I attempted to pull a vacuum, and it wouldn't hold, straight back to 0 after turning the pump off. I attempted to add a can of refrigerant with dye to see if I could find a leak, and I at least got the readings on the gauges to go up a little. I then started to hear a hissing sound I heard last year when trying to recharge on my own. I'm sure that's when the hissing initially started. There had to have been a leak before that tho and that's why i was trying to recharge. At that time, the ac worked for months and then would only work for an hour or so before blowing warm air. Let the car sit from an hour to as long as overnight, and the ac would be back blowing cold for an hour or so again before going back to warm, but that's another story. 

So I got under my car and rubbed around on the compressor and hoses and found there was a tear on one of the hoses that came out of the condenser to the compressor. Happy I found it! I initially thought it was near the firewall and could have possibly been the evaporator core.

Anyway, what could be the reason I only feel air when placing my hand against the torn part of the hose? Shouldn't it be leaking with refrigerant? When I point the black light at it, I can see it glowing green but only on the inside of the hose, on the mesh/net looking part. None leaking on the outside. So, where's the refrigerant going? Or am I missing something or not understanding something about how this works? Maybe me manually pouring the dye in through the low side hose on the manifold gauge has something to do with it? What's the reason for only air if refrigerant is supposed to leak in the form of liquid/oil?

Note: The hissing sound only lasts but so long. Maybe like a minute before it stops from refrigerant running out, so I had to move fast after adding the can of refrigerant. Glad I found it on the second time around because all I purchased was two cans

For the control arm you might be able to bend it back by removing and hammering but most likely going to need to replace the lower arm at the minimum… 

Edit: honestly probably should get it checked by a mechanic and call insurance.

HardyB75 (Score: 3): Not sure what you can do honestly. The unibody got damaged. If I had to guess. Eventually that will rust and cause issues. You’re going to need a welder to weld a patch over that.

I’d also make sure when lifting the vehicle to not lift it anywhere near that, and only use solid frame points.

As for the alignment - I’d take it in for an alignment. The metal being bent isn’t a concern of mine yet."
1n2k44h,Possible ECU short circuit?,"I installed a sub in my car and then decided the remote turn on wire was safe to just shove into a random fuse in the fuse box and put the fuse over it. The fuse was fuse 22 “Circuit stop light, high mounted lights, anti lock brake system, main body ECU, multiport fuel injection system/sequential multiport fuel injection system, shift lock control system, vehicle stability control.” according to my manual. it says it’s spot 25 next to the actual fuse.

you probably damaged the fuse box doing that, you need to use a fuse tap.

also, you just picked a random fuse and went with it? you need to check it to make sure its switched first. thats probably why its causing a weak start, you probably picked a fuse with a constant hot and its draining the battery.

1n2pf5q,Just discovered the coolant reservoir cap has been ajar for four months. What to do?,"See title. I know, check your fluids regularly. It's not my car, otherwise I would have. 

2010 Hyundai Accent. 

Someone who's not very mechanically inclined is visiting so I offered to check out their car. Right away I found there is next to no coolant in the radiator. Looked down at the reservoir cap and it was just gently touching the mouth of the reservoir instead of snapped into place for a proper seal. It was likely sitting like that for four months which is when it was brought in to a shop for a coolant flush. Drip hose was still pointed into the reservoir, but the reservoir was also dry to the bone. No evident cracks or leaks, so evaporation through the opening is my guess.

I see no signs of an overheating engine from what I can tell and the fuel economy has been excellent over these months. The oil level is good and it looks clean, not milky at all, so I'm hopeful it's not a head gasket issue. 

I've already topped the radiator off with coolant and am monitoring levels for the next few days. I filled it cold as a temporary measure so I could go to work but will bleed the system with a funnel tomorrow morning.

You **need** one coil to get the car back to driving; the other coils and plugs are due to the fact that they may fail soon to, so why not hit it all at once...

So if you want to minimize pain, have the shop do the plus and coils and stop there.

No noises or sounds currently and car is working fine. I’d like to avoid premature damage if possible and I’ll be going on a long trip soon.

He said he was aware of the leak (job 5) and that it shouldn't be a problem. As for the other specifics of the quote, we didn't really get into it too much. The dealership said that the vehicle could have some issues with 4wd if we didn't get the drive shaft replaced (job 7), but the family member didn't seem concerned. Regarding the brakes, family member said he never replaced them, but also said they never indicated signs to need replaced (which, based on the dealership claiming the brakes are worn almost to metal, indicates a need of replacement).

• finally took it into a shop to assess the issue, came to the conclusion that the initial pump failure in june threw metal bits into the fluid and contaminated the whole system. i purchased another rack unit (also from detroit axle by recommendation of a mechanic friend) and the shop picked the power steering pump to install. they flushed the system multiple times after installing and realligned before returning.

currently, the truck is pulling to the right, and when the wheel is turned/passed about 3/4 left, i hear this scraping sound briefly as if something metal is scratching against something else, about 250 miles after recieving the truck. i went back to have it realigned, shop double checked to make sure i knew they already did it, and went through with the reallignment. wheel is still not aligned and is pulling exactly the same amount to the right.

i have not a clue anymore what to do. i love this truck, my literal dream truck, and i really don't want to give it up. i've dropped so much money and wasted so much time trying to figure out what's wrong and im at a loss for words. i don't exactly have the money to throw at a shop to spend an hour looking at it to diagnose the issue, either :(

TL;DR: I wouldn't mess with it until the winter, IF you notice that the coolant never gets above 50 or 60°C. If you still see 80-85°C in the winter, no problem.

The part that controls this is called a thermostat. There is a calibrated spring-loaded melty thing inside your cylinder head. The melty part will solidify and resist the spring pressure, which closes off a valve that allows coolant through the radiator. When the coolant becomes warm enough to melt the melty thing, the spring can pull the valve open and allow coolant to flow through the radiator, which cools the coolant, and makes the melty part solidify again. Eventually, it will reach a steady state where the melty thing is partially melted, with the thermostat valve partially open.

In your vehicles history, it's possible that it went to a shop for a failed thermostat, and someone installed a colder thermostat. This means that the melty part melts at a lower temperature, allowing the valve to open sooner and keep the coolant at a lower temperature.

Another possibility is that is now failed in a stuck open or partially open position, allowing coolant to rush through and get cooled.

This becomes a concern in the winter. If you get to the winter and see that your coolant never gets above 50C or 60C, I would advise changing the thermostat. Inside each cylinder, especially a diesel, the temperature can reach 500°C. The heat has to go somewhere, so it conducts through the cylinder walls and cylinder head and into the coolant. We want a specific temperature difference between the inside of the cylinder and the coolant. This allows optimal fuel burn, oil temperatures, and allows the heat to expand the metal inside the engine the right amount, uniformly. Too cold or too hot, and we can cause a head gasket leak. Too hot is a MUCH bigger concern than too cold, though.

1n2aea8,Brake pedal sinking 2000 Lexus RX300,"So about two weeks ago, the brake pedal on this car started sinking usually when at a full stop but also when approaching a full stop slowly.

Went to a place that specializes in brakes and has almost perfect Google review average, they opened the hood and in a few seconds immediately said it was the brake master cylinder. they didn't even mention the brake fluid was old though, and it was visibly brown in that little tank. They quoted $240 just to replace the master cylinder and I had found the part myself on eBay.

Anyway, I later went to a Tire Kingdom with very decent review average because the car also needed a few new tires, and while I was there I mentioned the sinking pedal issue. They concluded that I needed new rear brake pads (which was true, there were only a couple thousands of an inch left before they would start squeaking) and also new brake fluid as it was a dark brown whereas it's supposed to be light yellow. The mechanic also checked the master cylinder for leaks and said he couldn't find any, so replacing it wasn't actually necessary.

I can still return the master cylinder if not needed, but the thing is that even after the new rear pads and new brake fluid, the pedal still sinks to the floor when slowly approaching a full stop or when at full stop. But it *seems* to happen less often, when it does sink and I release the pedal and hit it quickly again, it brakes just fine. But then it also did that somewhat well before changing pads and fluid.

Should I go back to Tire Kingdom and demand they also replace the master cylinder without charge since ""pads and fluid"" weren't exactly what was needed to fix that issue, but at the same time those were also necessary, or just keep driving the car and keep the new master cylinder in it just in case it really fails later down the road?",3,1756382711.0,3,AskMechanics,1756496014,2025-08-28 12:05:11,2025-08-29 19:33:34,Sycosocial20 (Score: 1): Did the ebay master cylinder have a brand name?

Recently there was a sudden engine misfire problem, and the repair in the garage is not worth it (quoted 4000 nis (1200$) to open the engine and try to fix it, or 6500 nis (2000$) to replace the engine)



I would love to try and locate the issue and fix it myself, before selling it for parts/send to scraps.

Here is the timeline of events: half a year ago I did a 10k km service for it myself (for the first time). i've replaced oil, oil filter, spark plugs and engine filter.

about 2.5 months ago i began to have minor engine skips when starting the car, which gradually got worse. A month +- ago i went to my mechanic, and **they replaced the ignition coil**, which fixed the engine skips.

Also, about a year ago i've noticed i **was losing engine oil over time**, and the mechanic told me it's common with older engines and cars, and recommended to keep an eye on it and top it up when it gets low.

6 days ago, i was preparing for a long ride so i checked + added oil (it was a bit lower than the minimum before i added) and checked the air in tires.

4 days ago i drove for 2 hours in each direction, but nothing special happened.

3 days ago, suddenly in the middle of a light ride, there was a horrible sound from my engine. stopped immediately, ordered a tow truck, and check OBDII for the error codes.

Codes are

* P0302 (Cylinder 2 misfire)
* P0301 (Cylinder 1 misfire)
* P0300 (Random Multiple Cylinder (s) - misfire)
* the other code (P0711) regarding the transmission fluid temprature is a known issue for over 5 year (that's why i bought an OBDII scanner)

Could this be caused by the 10k self service i did? Maybe the spark plugs i used, or an improper torque? (i checked the specs and used a torque wrench, but maybe ive missed something?)

It recently became undrivable - brakes failed (both front and back need full replacement), need to replace serpentine belt, tires are bald, CEL is on, and the mechanic found leaking struts, and all brake pads/rotors at 0mm. They quoted me around $2.5k-$3.5k to make it roadworthy again.

Here’s where I’m stuck:

* Even repaired, the car would probs only be worth maybe $1.5–2k because of the salvage title.
* As-is, I can get \~$500 from a junkyard, maybe $300-700 from a dealer trade, or possibly $1,000-1,200 if I sell it private on FB marketplace (not sure how this would work)

1. Does \~$2.5k sound reasonable for the work the mechanic outlined?
2. Is it smarter to cut my losses and sell/junk it instead of putting that money in?

The revised version is a  good engine. The one before is a terrible engine that goes kaboom often

Doubleday5000 (Score: 1): It's obviously personal and depends on your circumstances, but I think the consensus would be:

* I think this is a wet belt engine. These wet belt ""Ecoboom"" engines are not well regarded. They can catastrophically fail. The chances of this can be reduced with good servicing, but this only has records of three services in 52,000 miles. Check if this is a timing chain model. Don't trust Cinch. Find the production date and VIN and do some research. 
* Cinch does not have a a good reputation. I'll leave it at that. 
* Over £10k is a lot to spend on a first car. Your chances of at least dinging it are very high. This is emotionally and financially painful on a pricier car. Most suggest spending £3-4k.  Obviously if you're a millionaire this doesn't matter. 
* If you plan to finance with them that's actually £13k. Finance is also risky on a first car. You probably don't know what car actually suits you. I did loads of research and got a great car on paper, but sold within 9 months to get something that worked better for me. Luckily I had no debt to sort out or tie me to the car."
1n2qrw6,240k S-Max refurb - Is it worth it.,"My 09 2.2 s-max has 240k miles and currently looks after my family of 7, usually 5 and sometimes 6.

It’s been well kept with what ever it needs, oils, belts, pumps, filters, dpf, clutch, transmission oil etc.

My question(s) - is it worth doing more preventative/restorative work or am I throwing money into a dying car.

Work done within the last 10k miles
Clutch and dmf
Timing belt, tensioner and water pump
Dpf
Drive shaft seals
Transmission fluid

Also had full set of shocks and springs about 100k miles ago
Trailing arm bushes about 70k ago.

On a list of prospective work is:
Power flex bushes (not sure which is most useful as a full set is pretty pricey)
Turbo recondition/rebuild (no idea of cost)
EGR clean
New injectors
Anything else worth doing to keep it in Good shape?

Is it worth it? The car runs really well. Small hesitations occasionally but that’s it. Strong engine, seems to still handle fine. 

Needs alignment but rear adjustment bolts are seized but that’s about it.

I believe though that was over 18 only (even without the single seat).

Seems to me the ones for the young kids are designed to get as many people in on the day to let the kids pootle around but how many kids get to go to school on a Monday and show their mates them driving a supercar.

I think it also depends on which instructor you get as some are a bit more relaxed than others.

1n2l665,New ‘to me’ car advice…,"Hey all.

Find myself in a position where I NEED a car, but absolutely nothing in the market for my price point is really grabbing my attention, perhaps bar one…

Background - always had decent cars. M3s and similar, Range Rover, had an old V8 6 series that I loved and have currently owned my E60 BMW M5 for the past 10 years.

Job recently changed and commuting a lot more. Bought a bike. Rode for a year - sold it. Just too much aggrevation for a daily commute…

Now I need something else. M5 I’m undecided whether I’m going to sell or keep it but regardless I need to stop putting miles on it.

Budget 10-25k, pretty open really.

Now, what I’m looking for. COMFORT. And good fuel economy, but finding everything just meh. Comes with the territory I know. Also unfortunately - must be ULEZ. Want good spec too in terms of features offered…

Looking at 2015-2019 S Class S350d
Perhaps an A6 Avant

But besides that, no idea.

Am I missing any cars in that price range that offer just great comfort and good build quality?

Mrs has a RR Sport which I actually really like, but it’s absolute suicide owning 2 Range Rovers…

Welcome thoughts on some diamonds in the rough that I may be missing, or even comments on the S350d or A6. Are they a great choice?

TL;DR - Maturing and need a sensible car. Comfort and build quality is top of the list - need 30mpg plus. What to buy for 10-25k?

And there's a reason 'mature' folk end up in a lexus, their back is knackered and they only want to see the mechanic once a year for its service and MOT. 

If you prefer suv style, there's the NX or the larger RX, otherwise the smaller UX is available as hybrid or electric. Think it had a facelift around 2023. Takumi is the top spec, f sport is the sportier looking one (absolutely no difference to performance though) 

Otherwise the RC looks quite smart, though you'll probably hate the ecvt box in a car that looks like it should be fairly quick. But a lexus is for wafting, not trying to be within 2cm of the apex.


They also have 10 year / 100k mile warranty, so shouldn't be hard to find a nice looked after one.

I've been looking at the Audi S5 and BMW 440i but I don't have experience on what running costs will be like and would appreciate some advice.

I will not be able to fix anything myself as not mechanical inclined. Should I go for these even if service history is not perfect and get warranty from the dealer (they only seem to cover 1-2k).

Ideally looking to spend max £30k but could go up to £35k if it means less likely to have to deal with maintenance issues. I've also been wondering if I should get something a bit older but can then get an RS5 or M4 but don't want to compromise on tech like parking sensors.

It's silent around town gives good fuel economy overall, plenty of space for a buggy and other bits in the boot and a rear facing child seat. 

What else...Brake pads last forever as they barely get used (engine does majority of the braking). The gearbox has no mechanical parts so no clutch or other headaches to worry about. 

The only thing you'll need to do service engine yearly with Toyota. Slightly more expensive but you get a year's warranty on the hybrid battery 3qch time.

3. The plastic trim on the rear has been flagged, but I have never had anything happen to it. The photo seems to show normal plastic fatigue due to flexure or dryness. I can't understand what else to really say about that other thank it just needs some spray...

All in all, I feel they have made a massive loss on these cars due to the depreciation and are trying to find absolutely anything to get their money's worth. I have generally had a good relationship with the company (Zenith Autos), but this is far off what I was expecting and feel like they are being unfair. I have returned two cars already to Alphabet with no charges whatsoever and could really do with some advice on what to do.

There are also manual Foresters out there, but I noticed they don’t have the **SI-Drive modes (Sport/Intelligent)** that the automatics do. For anyone who’s driven both: does this make a noticeable difference in daily driving, or is it more of a gimmick?

1n24y2w,Valuations,"Hey peeps

I’ve been looking at getting a new car and run some valuations with Parkers, Confused and Whatcar. 

The first two get their valuations from CapHpi and the latter uses Autotrader who determines their values from the cars advertised. 

The valuations from Parkers and Confused can be wildly different thus I was wondering why this might be if the data source is the same?

Also, does any one know of any companies that use Percayso or Glass’s to provide their valuation, for free?

OrdoRidiculous (Score: 2): IS300s were rare to begin with, all of them in this country are 5 speed automatics

I had an IS200 as my first car, then an IS300. Both had the Torsen LSD, but to be honest the chassis benefits immensely from a 1.5 way anyway. If you're serious about a drift set up, I'd get whatever IS200 you can find with a good chassis (which is becoming difficult) and then drop a V8 in it. There are a shit load of turnkey 1UZ/3UZ swaps available now that will even bolt to the horrendous 6 speed manual gearbox from an IS200. The IS200 handles better by a country mile, the 2JZ in the 300 is a boat anchor and I hated the way it drove compared to the 200. 

I had a 3uz IS200 for a while, perfect engine for the car. Your budget isn't realistic though, these cars are getting expensive now and by the time you've sorted out the diff, suspension and given them enough power to actually drift capably you'll be closer to double your budget. The diff on the IS200 isn't great, the ratio is very high and it's the smaller pumpkin compared to the 300. You can swap out a diff from an IS250 that solves both of these problems, but you'd then need to put a limited slip in it (which is what I did). You'll have to do some magic with the rear shafts to make sure you have the speed sensors on the hubs though, but they do fit together like lego. 

The time to get a cheap IS200 was 10 years ago. They are a phenomenal chassis though, if you set them up right they will grip to the end of the earth and the drive extremely well. The solid rear bulkhead seems to do a lot for rigidity. You can get most of the way there with suspension (I went with coilovers), stiffer anti-roll bars and a full set of new bushes. That alone will cost you something in the order of 3.5-4 grand to do right.

1n1ypo9,NCD on 2 cars for 7 days,"Hi, so I know you can't simultaneously use NCD on 2 cars at once, however, I just want to check I'm not screwing myself with potential cancellation 

  
I was temporarily using my parents spare car for a few months, so I took out a policy as main driver (since I would be for the forseeable future) and used my existing 4years no claims - fast forward to now, I've bought a new car unexpectedly and taken out a policy using the same 4 years NCD, which I know isn't allowed, however, the first policy on my parents car will be cancelled in 6 days - which is when my parents new policy will take effect - will I be ok with this? 

  
So essentially, for the first 7 days of my new policy, the NCD technically overlaps, but will my new insurer (Tesco) care about that if they find out? Will they even find out? 

  
To answer at least one expected question; I didn't change vehicles on the initial policy because Admiral (insurer of parents car) wanted nearly triple the price Tesco (new insurer) gave me, which was ludicrous.

No one here knows for sure.

Tesco may find out, they may cancel. They also may not care as you had cancelled the other insurance. 

Your issue would be worse if you have an accident or need to make a claim, this is often when things are looked at it in more detail.

It’s the old risk V reward.

Could you not just cancel the policy on your parents car and get temporary insurance for a week to cover it?

Winter-Ad-8701 (Score: 1): Not sure why you didn't just wait the 6 days to be sure?

My guess is that you'll be ok, but if not then you run the risk of your insurance being cancelled, which you have to then declare forever.  Not worth the risk IMO, as they often share details across databases these days, the entire industry is setup to catch people making false declarations."

1n1y5o8,"What car would you pick? £10k budget, commuting into London 3–5 days a week","Hi everyone,

I’m about to start commuting from outside into London — about 60 miles each way, 3–5 days a week — and I need a car that won’t make me miserable on the motorway. Budget is around £10k.

A few things about me: I don’t have kids, don’t need loads of space, and would prefer an automatic. I’d love something that looks nice but isn’t massive, since I haven’t driven in years and I’m slightly nervous about manoeuvring in the city. Cabin noise drives me mad, so a quiet ride is really important to me.

It obviously needs to be ULEZ compliant, and mostly it’ll be for the commute and a bit of light shopping on the weekends. I’m torn on whether petrol, diesel or hybrid makes most sense — I know some diesels are fine as long as they’re Euro 6, but I’d rather hear from people who’ve actually been there.

So if you were in my shoes, what would you go for? Any models you’ve found surprisingly good (or terrible) for long commutes? I’d especially love to hear real-world experience on motorway noise, comfort, and running costs.

Thanks in advance — would really appreciate the help!",2,1756341474.0,32,CartalkUK,1756496014,2025-08-28 00:37:54,2025-08-29 19:33:34,"UniquePotato (Score: 5): Corolla
