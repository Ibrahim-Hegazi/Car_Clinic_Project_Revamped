The next day I try to start it and I just get a clicking sound over and over. I tried to jump start and trickle charge it but the second I tried to crank it the battery voltage would drop to 8V or less. I figured the battery was done so I got a new one. 

I hooked up my new battery and when I tried starting it I got the same clicking noise I heard as before. When testing voltages, the second I turn my key to on, not cranking, but just on, the battery voltage of the brand new battery drops to 8V and stays there until I take out the key. 

After some more testing today. The battery gets back up to 11V but then when I open any of my doors (with no lights on) it instantly drops back to 8V. This might be because I killed the battery trying to start it earlier but thought I would include it if it added any details.

1mxfry0,2004 Mazda: Key won’t turn in ignition immediately after mechanic repair. Should I push back or cut losses?,"I live in BC, Canada and have a 2004 Mazda Tribute (odometer is at 238k) that I had to get towed to the mechanic early this week. The mechanic fixed the pressing issue (something with the coolant hose) and I paid them. Once I got in the car to take it back, the key wouldn’t turn in the ignition cylinder. I told them the issue and the mechanic came out to help me. After a few minutes of trying to figure it out, he told me that I’d need to replace the lock cylinder because the key was probably worn. Luckily, I had a spare (basically brand new; barely used) key at home. So I came home that night and tried with the spare, but it was having the same issue.

I haven’t had this issue before, other than occasionally needing to wiggle the key slightly when unlocking the car. The key worked perfectly fine when the tow truck driver brought it in. I felt like it was kind of ridiculous that they wanted me to pay to fix it (I was quoted around $700 CAD) when the issue only came up the moment I got the car back from them.

I tried arguing with the mechanic but he just kept bringing up that the car has a lot of other issues and is getting old. When I pointed out that the timing is kind of crazy, he said that “weirder things have happened” and “people get struck by lightning”. They apparently drove the car out of their garage that morning and there was no problem until I got into it.

I know that my car is very old and definitely has a lot of other issues, but I can’t help but feel like the timing of this issue is too coincidental. The timing is also very unfortunate because the car also has an oil leak problem that I asked for them to look at and they quoted me around $2000 to fix it. I was already thinking that I might need to sell the car, but it’s not even drivable anymore. The car is now stuck in front of the mechanic shop and I can’t move it. I’m not really sure what to do.

**TL;DR:**
My 2004 car was brought to a mechanic, and when I got it back the key wouldn’t turn (which wasn’t really a prior issue). The mechanic won’t take any responsibility and says that the car was old and it must have just failed, though the timing seems questionable to me.

**Question:**
Does anyone have any advice for how I should move forward? There’s no way I’m going to pay that much to fix the key problem, but it doesn’t seem like they’re willing to budge either. Should I push harder for them to take responsibility, or just cut my losses and tow it elsewhere? I’m worried that once it’s out of their lot they are even less likely to fix it, but I don’t think they are going to compromise. It’s definitely a possibility that the ignition just failed like this, but am I wrong to think the timing is too odd?

Wild guess here but it's possible it's boiling/evaporating out- q-jets were susceptible to vapor lock.  Especially if it has an exhaust heat riser stuck (pretty sure this has a vacuum operated riser with a thermovac switch) and forcing exhaust through the manifold bypass, while it's running the volume may be enough cool fuel to avoid vapor lock but it then boils out sitting on the hot manifold.  This could be exasperated by a low float level to start.   I guess I'd start by taking it off, removing the top and filling the bowl and see if it drains on the bench.

About a year ago I had the heads machined, valve grind and new gaskets all around done. Ever since, there has been a rattle coming from the engine under certain conditions. Sounds like someone shaking a can of nails under the hood. I have put uel headers on the car but it was happening prior to this as well.

Engine is at temperature, between 2000-3000 rpm, with light throttle input and driving up slight inclines while cruising on the highway. It won't happen when the engine is cold or at idle. It also won't happen with heavy throttle input.

It also happens when I'm cruising around town for extended periods. But only briefly while accelerating.

I've done some looking around and it seems to be a common issue. Most results point to pinging of some kind. I've tried running 91 octane and doing some Italian tune ups but it still pings. I have yet to start checking sensors but I really don't wanna start firing the parts cannon if I have to.

I don't notice it as much in the winter which leads me to belive it's temperature related but I'm unsure.

Maybe cost you about $10 and an hour or so of your time (idk how hard they are to replace on these cars. They're fairly easy on every car I've worked on). 

2. How bad is your windshield? Has it passed inspection before in the condition that it's in now? I thought it was only if your view is obstructed that they can dock you. Replacements I've heard aren't super expensive but I definitely can't replace one myself.

3. Sounds like you might need a steering rack. You can get remanufactured units but if you have no experience working on cars then I would take it to a shop for this. Take it to a good shop and get it diagnosed. Let them handle that part.

4. Control arms. Are these physically rotted completely off? I don't understand how they can dock you for a rusty arm unless it physically broken due to rust. I live in NE Ohio. Shit gets RUSTY. I've only seen a few cars where this actually causes a control arm to break and the rest of the car usually looks like it's about to do the same. These cars do not drive as the control arm is an essential suspension component. 

5. The bushing in the lower control arms do this over time and there are new ones to press in, but it might be just as cost-effective to get them replaced.


DEFINITELY look up how to replace those bulbs. DEFINITELY get the 2 corded tires replaced.

1mxfw8j,"Picked up my car from the shop, now the key won’t turn. Coincidence?","I live in BC, Canada and have a 2004 Mazda Tribute (odometer is at 238k) that I had to get towed to the mechanic early this week. The mechanic fixed the pressing issue (something with the coolant hose) and I paid them. Once I got in the car to take it back, the key wouldn’t turn in the ignition cylinder. I told them the issue and the mechanic came out to help me. After a few minutes of trying to figure it out, he told me that I’d need to replace the lock cylinder because the key was probably worn. Luckily, I had a spare (basically brand new; barely used) key at home. So I came home that night and tried with the spare, but it was having the same issue.

I haven’t had this issue before, other than occasionally needing to wiggle the key slightly when unlocking the car. The key worked perfectly fine when the tow truck driver brought it in. I felt like it was kind of ridiculous that they wanted me to pay to fix it (I was quoted around $700 CAD) when the issue only came up the moment I got the car back from them.

I tried arguing with the mechanic but he just kept bringing up that the car has a lot of other issues and is getting old. When I pointed out that the timing is kind of crazy, he said that “weirder things have happened” and “people get struck by lightning”. They apparently drove the car out of their garage that morning and there was no problem until I got into it.

I know that my car is very old and definitely has a lot of other issues, but I can’t help but feel like the timing of this issue is too coincidental. The timing is also very unfortunate because the car also has an oil leak problem that I asked for them to look at and they quoted me around $2000 to fix it. I was already thinking that I might need to sell the car, but it’s not even drivable anymore. The car is now stuck in front of the mechanic shop and I can’t move it. I’m not really sure what to do.

**TL;DR:**
My 2004 car was brought to a mechanic, and when I got it back the key wouldn’t turn (which wasn’t really a prior issue). The mechanic won’t take any responsibility and says that the car was old and it must have just failed, though the timing seems questionable to me.

**Question:**
Does anyone have any advice for how I should move forward? There’s no way I’m going to pay that much to fix the key problem, but it doesn’t seem like they’re willing to budge either. Should I push harder for them to take responsibility, or just cut my losses and tow it elsewhere? I’m worried that once it’s out of their lot they are even less likely to fix it, but I don’t think they are going to compromise. It’s definitely a possibility that the ignition just failed like this, but am I wrong to think the timing is too odd?

You have a 21 year old vehicle with 238k on it. Think of all the times the key has been inserted into the ignition and removed, inserted and removed, inserted and removed, one metal part regularly moving against other metal parts, in and out and in and out. 21 years and 238k's worth of one metal part moving against other metal parts. It's similar to how canyons are carved after decades of water running through it or how the soles on your shoes wear down after walking on them for years. It's normal for key and the tumbler to wear with use. You even said that you've had to occasionally wiggle the key, which indicates that key is already worn. Considering you had the same issue with the spare key, which I'm assuming isn't used nearly as often, it's not JUST the key that's worn, but the inside of the tumbler, too. 

I get that it didn't act up until you got it back from the shop, but considering the Tribute was in for a coolant hose, the only thing that shop would have done to the key and tumbler is the same thing you do everyday...insert the key, turn to start, then remove when exiting the vehicle. 

Advice on moving forward? Educate yourself on how the key and tumbler work, and learn what happens to them after years of use. Go watch some videos on youtube. Do NOT be that customer who thinks they know better despite never having experienced this before, do NOT be that customer who assumes you know exactly what happened because it ""too coincidental"" and definitely do NOT ""push harder"". As a matter of fact, stop trying to blame the shop and stop trying to force them to take the blame. Just stop. 

If your car HADN'T been in the shop, this issue STILL would have happened. The only difference is that then, you'd have no one to blame. If you want to take it elsewhere, go for it, but I have a sneaking suspicion you're going to pay for a tow and pay for them to look at it, just for them to tell you the same thing. Regarding your oil leak, depending on how bad it is, you might be able to just top off the oil regularly to keep the engine lubricated and running. Again, it really depends on if it's leaking or hemorrhaging. 

Ultimately, if you want to sell it, sell it. If you want to put enough money into it to keep it safe or if you want to drive it til it dies, then do that. But FFS, educate yourself on your vehicle before you start insisting on things that make you laughable at best and an ignorant jerk at worst."

Who tested them? Only asking because 1/2 of the time when a customer comes in here with a bad battery or alternator they go ""Autozone checked it and said they were fine!"" despite clearly not being fine.

imprl59 (Score: 1): Alternators have a common mode of failure where they're intermittent.  If you test it when it's working it will test fine but 30 seconds down the road it'll die again.  Hypothetically, with the truck running and a good alternator you could take the battery out and throw it in a lake and the truck would keep running off the alternator until you turned off.  Back in the olden days before cars had computers it was common to test the alternator by pulling a battery cable off with the engine running to see if it kept running.  That's not a good idea anymore now that cars have multiple computers for reasons..

Second part is that batteries and alternators often fail in murder / suicide manner.  Car batteries hate to be fully discharged and an older battery will often not recover from that so if your alternator fails it can murder the battery.  Alternators hate to be run full tilt for an extended period of time so if the battery fails internally it can murder the alternator.

So what do you do?  First step is to fully charge that battery again.  Once it's charged take the battery and the alternator to the parts store of your choice.  Get a new alternator and have them load test the battery.  Get a new battery when it fails the load test...

If there's a starter/alternator shop in your area you'll likely get a better product having them rebuild your alternator instead of getting a spray paint rebuild from the parts store or a new low quality Chinesium rebuild.  That takes longer though and the parts store definitely has one sitting on the shelf waiting for you.

Unless you drive in heavy traffic, abour 80% of driving doesn't happen with the fan on.


The OEM updated design is almost certainly more efficient and quieter than the original straight blade design.



The curvature changes the blade sound profile, as shown in this paper: [https://www.mdpi.com/2624-599X/2/4/43](https://www.mdpi.com/2624-599X/2/4/43)


Another simple reality is that fewer blades are more efficient, and a theoretically maximally efficient fan would have 1 blade.


Go with the OEM curved design, which should be quieter and will work just as well as a ""turbo"" fan.

1mx74r4,Valvoline Instant Oil Change - DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Back in February, against my better judgement, I took my 2014 Camaro SS to Valvoline Instant Oil Change in Florence, KY for a routine oil change. This was the first time I had let anyone other than the dealer or my preferred personal mechanic at Auto Tire in Greenwood, IN work on my car. I figured, it's just a basic oil change. Who could screw that up? Silly me, right! I decided to take advantage of their upsell to also change my differential fluid because the car had about 82,000 miles on it, and it had yet to be done. So my $100 oil change turned into a nearly $300 service appointment. No complaints on the price because it was February and the last thing I really wanted to do was crawl under the car in the middle of the winter. Having relocated to the area within the last 2 years, I had yet to find a trustworthy mechanic, and my car is barely driven so I felt like the risks were low. Just a month later I started to notice weird noises coming from the vehicle. I thought maybe I was hearing the beginning signs of a problem with my power steering pump. Only a 2014 Camaro doesn't have a power steering pump so that clearly wasn't it. I recognized that the noises were coming from the back of the vehicle. So I decided to take the car back to Valvoline and have them make sure they put enough fluid in and didn't forget anything. They checked and assured me that they had completed the job. Since it was winter and I barely drove the car, I didn't think about it much for a few months. Fast forward to August 20th. The weird noises persisted. So now the car is with a trustworthy mechanic who has determined that the wrong fluid was added to the differential during the service. 

So I contacted Valvoline to inform them of this and to their credit, they immediately launched an ""investigation"". They instructed me to pause any repairs until their process was complete. I informed them that I had already given them the opportunity to address the issue when I returned with the vehicle in March and the parts were already ordered and I would do no such thing. Valvoline Customer Service called me to conference me in with the Manager of the local store who assured me their location was now under new management and if anything had occurred, it happened on the watch of a previous Manager. They moved forward with their ""investigation"" which apparently only involved calling my new mechanic and asking him what type of fluid goes in the differential of a 2014 Camaro. Of course he told them the correct fluid which matched the part number on their invoice. 2 hours later Valvoline Customer Service called me to conference me in with the Manager of the local store again who informed me that their investigation was complete and they found they had done nothing wrong. I asked if they were suggesting that it was purely coincidental that the differential on the vehicle went bad a mere 3 weeks after their service. Their answer was an emphatic YES! This might not be so difficult to believe if my encounter didn't involve me spending so much time fielding questions from the young members of the Valvoline staff about how fast my car that their Supervisor had to repeatedly remind them to stay on task during the job. Something an actual investigation probably would have picked up if they were genuinely concerned with getting to the bottom of the issue. 

So now I am facing a $3,000 repair bill that was completely avoidable if I had just trusted my gut and driven right past Valvoline Instant Oil Change located at 10000 Demia Way, Florence, KY 41042 (859)282-8462. 

In short, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY with Valvoline Instant Oil Change!!!!

i bought it a couple days later and on my drive home i put some shell gas in it to clean out the whole system a bit (heard it has more cleaning additives) and pushed the engine close to red line for a little on the autobahn (about 180kph, max is 192).

after about 10 seconds at that speed i noticed a bad smell, i think it smelled like burnt rubber one of the passengers with me said it was more like exhaust and the other said a burnt clutch (at 180kph i was certainly not pressing the clutch and it doesn't smell at all in low RPM usage so i don't think it's that). i slowed down and the smell faded pretty much instantly. a couple minutes later i did the same and the smell came again and went away when i slowed down. the rest of the drive i stayed at around 120-140 kph and the smell never came back so it's just in the \~4500+ rpm zone

i had AC and air recirculation turned on, so it wasn't coming from outside either

i popped the hood later that evening to check the drive belt and did notice some fresh looking drops on the plastic engine cover, so maybe oil was splashing out somehow? not many and i didn't see any splashes when i checked the engine bay before buying it. the bay also wasn't really cleaned or detailed, it looked normal so i don't think the previous owner cleaned anything off

one day about 2 months ago My car died on me I went to go run an appointment that morning and my gas was really low, stopped and only put $5 in went to my appointment car started up fine after. headed home and stopped at store across the street and car wouldn't start without a jump starter was clicking it just wouldn't catch and start. jumped started fine. battery is about 1 year old. went to AutoZone where I bought they tested and said bat, alt, and starter, all check fine.

did it to me again a few weeks later, again I was on fumes. jumped started fine

now check engine light is on and it did it to me again but this time I had just put gas in and had little over 1/2 a tank. any ideas ?

also, wondering if it could have anything to do with the gas I'm using? my Manuel says to only use top tier gas and if not use a fuel additive. I only have one place by me that has actual top tier brand gas. (shell) it's 20 mins away so it's a pain in the ass.

I only ask this because I did have one time a year ago where the light came on after putting some gas in from a shitty discount gas station, put shell in for the next few fill ups and it went away.

Make sure to wiggle the shifter or try it in neutral when it doesn't start.  
If the engine cranks but does not start, then that could be other issues.  I have had bad ignition switches allow a crank but no start, in a Honda.

korey1977 (Score: 1): If it is starting with a jump it is most likely a loose connection and the added amperage is allowing it to bridge the gap in the connection. It could also be a starter, there is no good way for a parts store to check a starter while on the vehicle.  A 2018 kia should have low enough compression to run on 87 octane gas,and that would not have any effect on starting as you stated. Low octane gas in an engine that requires higher octane will still run and start it will just have premature detonation which would knock and would lead to a check engine light.

1mwzfyo,Would this be a feasible career for me?,"I know nothing about this topic other than watching videos of people doing home calls and repairing things. But it always seemed interesting to me. I'm 23m, I've learned a lot of labor skills over the years but it's not really relevant. 

I've been looking into different careers. I think I'm kind of drawn to hands on/problem solving work and my local tech school has classes in automotive technology. I don't have many connections in this field. 

I'm pretty dang frugal. I kind of always just wanted to live within my means and save, and not have to work every single day of my life. I've done some labor like that where I do maybe a job a week. It wasn't insane pay obviously. 

But to me, working 3 longer days a week or working ""part time"" (not necessarily less hours a week, just less days or less per day) sounds the most appealing to me. I know a lot of culture is very much work oriented. 

I also like the idea of doing house calls for people, or getting called in to go work on stuff. A friend of mine did rim repairs and businesses would call him in to fix stuff on their vehicles. Truthfully that sounds the most appealing. 

I was wondering if I could get your thoughts on it. I don't mind hard work one bit..I'm just pretty lost and ultimately I want something I can support myself with, maybe eventually take on more work for more pay, learn a skill, and have a degree of flexibility so I can enjoy my life while I live within my means.

If you like hands-on work and problem solving then yes it definitely is a job you'd be able to do. I got into it the same way. I watched YouTube videos and had an interest in how cars worked. I also hated not knowing what the dealer was talking about trying to rip me off.

Apply to be a lube tech at a dealership. You'll learn how to do simple things first (oil changes, tires, brakes, etc) then move onto learning how to diagnose and perform more complex repairs. I went to a small shop after 3 years knowing how to do basic diagnosis and learned wayyy more there, but I wouldn't have been able to do it without dealer experience first. 

The pay is usually decent (side work is a blessing as well), but you usually have to buy your own tools. It adds up pretty quickly for the good stuff, and you have to keep buying more to do bigger and more specialized jobs. 

Overall I would say it's a great field. It's hard on your body and mind, but it's worth it being able to see your work making a difference. Best of luck!"

1mxl5kb,I think the body shop damaged our car and tried to cover it up?,"I bought my car brand new, no previous owners, and like 18 miles on it total. I am the sole owner of the car and used it to commute to work. On my 3rd day of owning the car, there was an unfortunate incident where someone backed into my parked car while I was at work, resulting in the bumper being crushed on the right side. I left it like that for a while because I was stressed and put off repairs and dealing with insurance, etc. A few months later, we ended up leaving the country (US) for 3 months because my boyfriend was able to do a digital nomad situation at the time, so we left the car with his parents and entrusted it to them to just have it parked in their backyard. At one point during our travels, his stepdad called us to let us know he wanted to “surprise” us by getting the bumper fixed, without our consent or knowledge at all. He had taken it to a shop to get it “repaired.” We were pretty upset about this as we had no knowledge of him taking it there and also insurance was going to cover the damages since there was internal damage to the car on rear right side. When we finally got home, I noticed there were a few things off with the car. The window on the front drivers side would knock when we rolled it down, there were deep small scratches on one side (they insisted it had to be a wild animal as they get lots of raccoons there), little things like that. I took the car to the dealership for an oil change and they let me know that the blind spot monitoring system wasn’t working partially because of a broken sensor from the guy backing into my car on the passenger side, but also the mirror on the front drivers side was “throwing codes” and likely needed to be replaced as it seemed to be hit or something

This confused the hell out of me because nothing had ever happened to the left side of my car, and the mirror looked fine on the outside?? I figured it must have been some weird little thing, like maybe while being parked at a grocery store someone hit it with their cart or something. I let it go.

Fast forward to now, we finally took our car into a body shop and the at-fault driver’s insurance covered the bill to replace all the damage to the rear bumper. When we picked the car up, the mechanic there let us know our blind spot monitoring still didn’t work, and they were puzzled by that so decided to take more of a look as to why that could be.

They let us know there’s evidence that the entire drivers side of the car had been repainted by someone.

They showed us where the door had been painted over, and that the mirror had been damaged internally. It’s literally from the front all the way to the back of the car that an unknown amount of damage had been covered up.

We confronted my boyfriend’s stepdad about this, as the only time a repair like that could have been possible is when we dropped the car off with them to just park it in their yard. They were confused too as they said nothing had ever happened to the left side of the car before they took it in. 

They’re saying the damage had to have been done at the shop he took it to and the shop covered it up. We’re getting the information tomorrow morning from the shop as to what exact condition the car was in when he dropped it off to them and what “repairs” they did, but my question is this:

Can a shop legally have altered my car in any way without my knowledge or consent? This repainting was without a doubt done by them, what I’m unsure of is where and how the damage occurred and who was at fault for that. Can a family friend literally just make decisions for your car for you without ever communicating that??

The downside with the Grey Pneumatics is that the sockets have no roll mark (laser etching only) and the square drive is just flat and not even chamfered and the corners aren't relieved, not sure if that will make the impact gun wear faster ...

The Grey Pneumatic set also comes with a really space efficient case, which is nice as these will go into a tool bag.

But then the Capri set comes with 21 and 22mm sockets which would be really useful. Gonna need a 21 for sure.

no-pog (Score: 1): Where do i even start... 

1) Propellers are not 100% mechanically efficient. there's the slippage and vortex shedding of the propellers themselves. Air slips off the end of the props and is no longer useful for mechanical propulsion or energy generation.
2) the propellers in the back have to catch all of the air, otherwise we're not capturing the energy and putting it back into the system. There are a huge number of problems with this. The air is turbulent coming off the front prop, meaning the secondary props can't catch that air and use it efficiently. There are random high and low pressure pockets inside of any given cross section engaging any part of the second props. Also, you would need a prop that covers the entire prop wash from the first propeller, which sheds air in a cone. So you need one enormous propeller concentric with the first, not two small ones. Finally, we would need the driven props to counter rotate in sync with the first prop, otherwise they aren't capturing the energy.
3) let's assume we can efficiently capture all of the air from the first prop. Now there's nothing left over to drive the machine forward. The thing just sits still and does nothing.
4) If this is electrically driven, assuming that ALL of the air and mechanical issues are worked out, AND they're somehow running perfectly efficiently, the BEST we can hope for is 64% energy recycling, because electric motors and generators are only about 80% efficient. 20% is lost to heat during power generation, and another 20% is lost once we spend the energy driving the prop. This doesn't count the coulombic efficiency of any battery ballast or the power loss from heating wires by carrying current.
5) if this is in space, as your drawing suggests, there is no air in the first place."

When using the [negative terminal](https://imgur.com/a/k3VUASx) to check amp draw, the numbers are within normal range when the car is ""asleep."" 

When testing the voltage across the pins on the top of the fuses with the battery hooked up, there are 2 fuses that show a 00.1 voltage draw. A 7.5a fuse running the dome light, and a MAIN 40 fuse running the headlights. According to [this chart](https://imgur.com/a/MDntITK) that is equivalent to 10+62 amp draw. (The 7.5amp fuse isn't a ""mini,"" but it seems that the if there was a 7.5 fuse listed in the ""standard"" part of the list, it would be a similar draw) This still isn't enough to kill the battery overnight, correct?

The one way check valve for the fuel system is part of the fuel pump assembly and not replaced separately. A bad one would allow fuel pressure to bleed off but wouldn't cause a fuel smell. If you smell gas fumes and don't have a check engine light and the fuel system is bleeding off pressure then you are probably looking at a leak in the fuel line between the tank and the engine.

CaptnSave-A-Ho (Score: 1): There is a fuel backflow valve that is built into the fuel pump. If it goes bad, it allows fuel to return to the tank when the car is off. This means it takes two attempts to start, but then it runs fine once its going. Or you can prime it by turning the key and waiting a second before starting. This will allow it to start on the first try. The only way to fix this is to replace the fuel pump. But it doesn't hurt the pump or damage the pump to run it like it is. So its usually not worth it to fix, unless you have the money and are particular about your car. 

This problem won't cause a fuel smell, so that would be unrelated. If you have to try to smell fuel, and even then its sometimes, then there probably isn't a problem to chase there."

1mxe2oi,Suspicious Business?,"I wanted some opinions on the auto service experience I just had.

So, my car has been leaking oil lately and based off what I've researched and I've witness myself, it is the oil pressure sensor/sending unit that's the culprit. It only leaks when it's on and I can physically see where the oil is leaking when the car is idling. I've gotten up underneath the car with a flashlight and seen it with my own two eyes. For reference, [the leak was practically identical to this](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/-kq5Y9X8mII). There's a stream of oil and it's dripping down on the passenger side. The oil filter is dry, everything above it was dry and clean before i drove it.

So I take it in to the shop, ask to get the service done. They tell me I need leak detection. I tell them I don't need or want leak detection, I've physically seen where it's leaking from. They tell me it could be other things and other places and while possible, this IS a leak that needs to be closed and all I'm willing to budget on at the moment.

I came to this place 2-ish weeks back and they said leak detection would be 241$. Suddenly, it's 84$. I still declined it, pretty sure I knew the issue, and wanted to point out the exact part I wanted fixed physically on the car. They said they were going to lift the car so I could do so, but this never occurred and I was told to return to the building when I went to go do it. They just sent the receptionist back out to tell me ""yeah its a gasket, we have to replace the gasket"". Mind you, no leak detection was performed (these take a full day and I don't have a full day). And the Gasket was going to run me like 800$. I declined that and stuck to my guns; it was the sensor.

The exit report between 2 weeks ago and now is like night at day: First, they changed my oil and recommended a few things. They also did a customary health inspection on the vehicle. No real notes.

Now, they've added several things, stressing the car was unsafe to drive. They also said they verbally advised me it was unsafe; that was false. The most they did was ask me how I even got it there (I keep oil onhand at all times) and to be careful driving it in general. This is the same car from 2 weeks ago and I'm a homebody. I've taken it to work and back with no issues, always topped up with oil.

Currently, im home; on the drive home the car was making a whining sign when pressing the accelerator. I washed the undercarriage of the car to get rid of the oil from the initial leak. I'm waiting on that to dry so I can take a look at the sending unit and I'm wondering, since I never pointed out the exact thing i wanted fixed, if it was even correctly fixed at all. But, I'm also getting major sus vibes from the entire situation.

1mxdcpq,Questions About My 2009 Jeep Liberty,"
Hi, 
I’m reaching out for some guidance on my 2009 Jeep Liberty (103k miles). I still owe about $7,500 on it, and I’m trying to figure out what makes the most sense moving forward in terms of repairs. I need it to last a year.


Here are the main issues:
* The frame has rust in some areas.
* There’s stop-leak in the transmission (I bought it used, so I don’t know the history).
* The shop that inspected it already contacted my powertrain warranty company, and I’m waiting to hear back on what they’ll cover.

For safety, I already ordered new upper and lower rear control arms because the creaking noise when braking in the rain makes me nervous. My daily commute includes about 5 miles over water and the rest on a busy interstate, so reliability is very important to me. 


My question is: given the Jeep’s age, mileage, and condition, which repairs are actually worth investing in? Should I continue fixing it as problems come up, or is there a point where it makes more sense to stop putting money into it? Realistically, how long will this jeep even last? 


I really value your advice since I don’t have much experience with vehicles, and want to make the best decision here.
Thanks so much!!

My dad swears up and down that I am just hard on my brakes and thats why they keep going out, but clearly that can't be true because I put THIRTY THOUSAND miles on the first set of brakes (which could have been on for a decade since I got the car from my great grandma who never drove.)

We tried the shift lock override, which didn't work. I attempted to manually put it in park, but was unable to do so as the parts necessary to do so are situated under the battery, and I didn't have the tools necessary to take the battery out. The car drives just fine, so I ended up driving it home and putting it in neutral with the e brake on, and wheel chocks to stabilize it.

The mechanic I trust is about 30 miles south of where we live. 

My questions are: 

1.) Is the car safe to drive to the mechanic I trust, or should I find one nearby rather than risk driving it?

If it’s not actually shifting through the gears correctly when you’re driving it, then you shouldn’t drive it because you can over exert and overheat the transmission and damage it. If you can get it in Drive and it shifts correctly. Then yes it’s fine to drive it. But if for instance you can only get it to go into the D1 or D2 position, then no you shouldn’t drive it. 

Yes this sounds like a shifter linkage cable issue probably. They can get old and wear out and stretch out or break like any type of cable. 

It’s not an expensive or hard fix relatively speaking compared to a full transmission repair.

I noticed that voltage reading using a decent higher end OBDII scan tool's ""Live Data"" when the car is running is 1 to 1.5 volts off (less) than the voltage reading at the battery terminals using multimeter. If I look at multimeter, alternator should be fine. Minimum voltage reading using multimeter when the car is running is 13.5v.

1mx6weh,Help on electrical part,"Hey everyone! I have some issues regarding the electrical part for two sensors on a BMW X3 E83 with a 2.0 turbo charged M47 engine (with nearly 400k kms on it).

The sensors that give me some issues are The rail pressure sensor, and the Mass Air Flow sensor.

As a background, i did not have any issues with these two before, but had to do a lot of work on the engine in other parts, to replace the timing chains. All well on that, and did a lot of cleanup in other places also.

Another big thing that I did now was to remove the EGR, as the engine is at its limit with the amount of soot it can handle. To compensate the noxes, I also decreased the maximum power of the engine to 80% from the software and replaced the DPF witha new clean one. The EGR was also removed from the software.

After all the changes the two sensors (who are on a similar wire loom) are reporting that they have a short to B+, their values also are garbage, as the rail pressure sensor detects 5-6 bars, but the engine can run (rough indeed but without hiccups). This makes me think that it is only a reading error, as it should have a minimum of 200 bars.

I also measured the input cables that go to the sensors, with them decoupled, and for the rail pressure sensor i got that one pin is ground for sure, one pin is 5V (I am guessing this is the +), and the third wire was also 5V (which in my mind it is not ok, no?).

On the MAF sensor i have 4 wires, doing the same measurments i found the ground 100%, one wire is 12v (again, guessing this is the + wire), and the other two both have 5V on them (again, dont know if this is ok pr not?)

The wire loom seems ok, and the values dont change regardless of what gimnastics I try to make with the wires. Is there a chance that the sensors are bad, or worst case is the ECU?

I've been looking into different careers. I think I'm kind of drawn to hands on/problem solving work and my local tech school has classes in automotive technology. I don't have many connections in this field. 

I'm pretty dang frugal. I kind of always just wanted to live within my means and save, and not have to work every single day of my life. I've done some labor like that where I do maybe a job a week. It wasn't insane pay obviously. 

But to me, working 3 longer days a week or working ""part time"" (not necessarily less hours a week, just less days or less per day) sounds the most appealing to me. I know a lot of culture is very much work oriented. 

I also like the idea of doing house calls for people, or getting called in to go work on stuff. A friend of mine did rim repairs and businesses would call him in to fix stuff on their vehicles. Truthfully that sounds the most appealing. 

I was wondering if I could get your thoughts on it.

When i reported the claim on Admiral’s website I received a call from them a couple days later and I explained the situation again and said no one was claiming, that I was only notifying them and that I am in contact with the other party and that we are sorting it out privately. They said that if the other party was to claim I would have to accept full responsibility because I was the one manoeuvring to which I said OK, but I haven’t admitted anything. Admiral then must have called the other party to tell them that we have accepted full responsibility and the claim is in process or something along these lines. Hastings on their side provided garages where the other party can go and repair their car outside of insurance and they gave them the closest one which is in Twickenham. Admiral gave them a quote of £1400 and the garage gave them a quote of £2500. So it seems much cheaper to go through insurance even though both quotes are ridiculous. I have a mazda mx5 2015 and bumped into the hyundai’s door. For more than half the price the garage gave them they could buy a new door. The damage is a couple of dents with some scratches.

They just shrugged their shoulders and said it couldn't be fixed.  I asked to borrow a jack and I could have easily fixed it myself (just needed timing backing off a tooth) and they said no - can't be fixed.  broken. scrap.

Damn thing had 12 months MOT and I'd spent a fortune on it but the AA said they'd only pay for onward travel if we scrapped the car there and then.  Lazy lying bastards still annoy me to this day, and I'm convinced they had their own motivations for it.

To give you a ballpark idea, I have cars transported from Britain to Ireland occasionally, cost usually ranges from 4-700 quid, depending on the size of the car, which firm I use and whether they happen to have a truck going to that general area at the time.

If the difference is fine, wait it out with the main insurance and swap it when you get the new car.

1mx6ltj,Is this 2013 BMW X3 30d a good buy for us?,"Hi all,

My wife and I are looking for some advice on a potential car purchase. We have recently had a lot of expenses (marriage, international visa process) so our savings are low, meaning we will need to use finance. Our annual mileage will be very low, likely under 5,000 miles per year, but we need something practical and reliable.

We have found this particular car and would appreciate your thoughts:

**The Car:**

* **Price:** £14,250
* **Mileage:** \~46,000 miles
* **Engine:** 3.0L Diesel (N57 engine, 254 bhp)
* **Key Features:** Seems to have a good spec (Pro Nav, heated leather seats, 19"" wheels, Xenon headlights, etc.)

**Our Perspective:**

* **Pros:** The mileage is exceptionally low for its age, and the specification is excellent. It feels like a lot of car for the money and would suit our needs for space and comfort. The dealer is also including an RAC warranty.
* **Concerns:** My main worry is running a powerful, older diesel on such low annual mileage. I am aware this can cause issues with components like the DPF. It is also a Euro 5 vehicle, and I am unsure of the implications for Clean Air Zones, particularly as we are in the North East.

**Questions for the community:**

1. Is buying an older, premium diesel like this a mistake for primarily shorter journeys? I can do longer weekend runs no issue.
2. What are the common, costly issues to look for on this F25 model X3 and the 3.0d N57 engine? I have heard mentions of timing chains and xDrive transfer cases.
3. Are the running costs (servicing, tyres, potential repairs) likely to be prohibitive?
4. Does this seem like a sensible purchase on finance, given its age?

Any personal experiences or expert advice would be hugely appreciated. Thank you!

For what it's worth, we are budgetting around £500 between us for finance, and no issues putting another few £100 aside per month for car maintenance.

Am I going crazy?","* Partner bought car 3 months ago, it's her second car, had license less than a year, I've had mine 9 years and had several cars, several driving jobs, worked in dealerships, and now working in the automotive YouTube space. I know my cars.
* I identified immediately the car pulled to the left, steering wheel would ghost turn to the left. Was told the salesperson, when taking the car for a ""valet"" the day of handover, drove over a nail and the NSF tyre was replaced.
* Dealership confirmed tracking was out, did tracking, keys handed to partner who drove home. I tested the car, it still pulled to the left. We thought maybe there's something up with the suspension, or maybe as the car used to be a driving instructors car, something with the dual controls being removed had taken the steering out a tad. Who knows.
* Dealership again confirmed the tracking was out, did tracking, keys handed to partner, and I again tested when I got home, problem still there.
* Returned to dealership, went for a drive with their master tech as a passenger who confirmed the car did indeed ghost steer to the left. Blame was placed on unmatched wear of front tyres or the camber of UK roads (they mention this every single time we've spoken), OSF tyre replaced, tracking done, keys handed to partner, I drove, problem still there.
* Spoke to dealership, was told car would be taken in and investigated again. Day before booking a 3rd-party tyre garage in our city called to confirm the car was booked in with them for tracking. Tracking was adjusted but was mostly all OK. Car returned, I drove it, it still pulls to the left.
* Spoke to dealership, again the blame was placed on the camber of the road, a few ""what do you want us to do"" back and forths, call concluded with us going to the dealership to do an apples to apples comparison of another Corsa-E as the service manager said it might just be a natural characteristic of that car.

  
Our thoughts are:

* They did the tracking 3 times. We kept telling them the car is ghost steering to the left, and they've booked us in for the tracking to be done else where, meaning it's been tracked 4 times now. Every single time we've tested the car after this has been done and found it still goes to the left. Only after my last call today did they confirm that they have road tested the car, once with the Master Tech and the Service Manager, and ""confirmed that they are happy with the operation and performance of the car"".
* I recognise there is a camber to UK roads. We have tested this on flat roads, on 'normal' roads but driving on the other side (safely in our quiet estate, before anyone says). 
* If this is a natural characteristic of the car, as they have said it could be, surely they'd know this and would of said this earlier as they are a Vauxhall Main Dealer and logically would have seen this problem a fair bit from other customers?
* Am I being an idiot here? Is it all in my head? We're more than happy to accept we're idiots and take the embarrassing L on all of this if we do test drive another Corsa-E and it does the same thing, but surely this can't be real. Surely there can't actually be a car that has an innate quality of pulling to the left, that's fucking barmy.

Probably less than 1/3 of that. Hell, I had a BMW N62TU V8 rebuilt with new rings and all the valve stem seals for £3k a few years back and that's a lot more work.

The 2.4 D5 is the good engine, Haldex 5 AWD, 8-speed Aisin automatic is a really good box. R-design is top spec, bigger brakes, great inside. Part of the reason for the price premium is that these were the only D5 engines to pass Euro6.

Look out for rust underneath as the Belgium built P3 cars suffer from it (Torslanda built cars generally don't). Check if the Haldex unit has ever been serviced. Some P3 cars of this era have slightly random electrical issues but that might just be my mate's slightly abused XC70 - get someone to run a proper code reader over it if possible.
