1n6zra3,"2012 Toyota Sienna major engine work...Repair, replace, or move on?  Thoughts?","
Looking to crowd source some advice as I keep flip-flopping on this decision.  On our way home from a long 600 mile trip, our 2012 Toyota Sienna XLE engine started misfiring horribly.  Took it to the shop and, after replacing the ignition coils which didn't fix the misfire, the mechanic did a compression test and said that cylinder #1 has lost nearly all compression and the engine would either need to be rebuilt ($4K-$5K) or replaced with a used engine ($5K to $6K).  Two months prior to this trip, we dumped $2,800 on new Generals and alignment, fresh oil change, and new front struts and stabilizer bar.  Other new parts within the last 15K miles include new water pump and belts, L&R lower control arms, and rear coil springs (so the suspension is awesome!! haha).  The van has 155K miles currently.

We only use the van for long trips and pulling our pop-up camper at this point averaging about 5K miles per year the last two years.  I really can't see pouring another 5Gs into a new or rebuilt engine with a van that will get used so little.  I am leaning towards selling as-is and seeing what I can get ($2500?  $1500?)

1n6zg9r,Drain plug or vacuuming oil from engine,So I think all of us have crossed paths with this matter from a point of our lives since suction method became more popular among mechanics and I think I have the right answer so the short answer is  IT DEPENDS ON YOUR OIL CARTER so hear me out there are some carters that area surrounding it from inside is lower the drain hole as you can see in pic 2 it’s almost a 2cm gap so you do the math but in some vehicles ( most of them) the drain plug is level with the bottom of the carter so when you remove the plug all of the oil will drain. So if your carter is like pic 1 yeah go ahead like good old days and drain it but if it’s like pic 2 so it’s obvious suction is the way too goo but in general I believe if you’re not doing a flush or if you’re doing your maintenances regularly and you have plug like pic 1 suction is a smoother process and if it’s like pic 2 then I guess we have no choice then suctioning it. ,1,1756856644.0,6,MechanicAdvice,1756928058,2025-09-02 23:44:04,2025-09-03 19:34:18,"EarthToBird (Score: 1): Never in my life have I heard the term oil carter

1n6z2od,Wheel Bearing noise that isn't a bearing?,"Title says it all. I searched this subreddit for this and didn't find anything. 

2009 GMC Canyon Z71, RWD. 267,000mi/430,000km.

The wheel hub was recently changed. Edit: not recently...2022, but with Timken hubs, and all torqued to spec.

The wheels/tireshave been rotated and then rubber was replaced.

The noise is coming from the front left wheel. It sounds almost exactly like a wheel bearing - RrrrRrrRrrRrrRrrRrrr - like a low metal grinding.

It isn't really audible at low speeds. Only roughly 15MPH/20KPH and up. The faster the louder.

I can tell it isn't the wheel bearing, though, because a) it was done not that long ago, b) the sound actually doesn't get worse when the bearing is loaded. Actually - the sound doesn't occur at all when going straight. Only when the wheel is turned LEFT (unloaded) or right (loaded) Loading doesn't really seem to matter, angle is more important. 

Could it be the CV (Edit: I'm stupid, RWD has no front CV)? Ideas? Does it have to be the bearing…?

I'm posting to see if anyone has had a similar experience with a modern Mini. I have a 2023 Mini Cooper S, and the climate control is acting strangely.

With the A/C off and the temperature set all the way down to 60°F, the car vents blow out hot air. It's not just ambient air—it's noticeably warm, as if it's coming straight off the heater core. The only way to get anything other than hot air is to turn on the A/C.

I took it to the dealership, and the service advisor claimed this is ""by design"" and that all Mini Coopers are like this. He said they only blow cool air when the A/C compressor is running.

This seems like a warranty dodge to me. Every other car I've ever owned can at least pull in cooler outside air when the heat is set to low. It feels like a classic case of a stuck blending door actuator.

I drive a 2024 Volvo S60 B5 AWD (about 1.5 years old). Recently I’ve noticed something odd on the windshield: when driving into the sun or strong light, I see lots of tiny “spots” or speckles across the glass. They don’t come off with regular glass cleaner, windshield washer fluid, or even after going through a car wash. The surface even feels a little rough, almost like very fine sandpaper.

The car has been parked in a garage for the past 6 months, so it hasn’t been exposed to a lot of highway miles or harsh conditions. I even tried glass polish myself, but it didn’t improve the situation at all. The spots are not equally visible everywhere (see attached picture) and I can also see the same effect on the side windows.

My questions:
1. What could be causing these spots? (micro scratches, sandblasting, coating issue, something else?)
2. Is there any way to remove or reduce them myself (other products, techniques), or would this require professional glass polishing/replacement?
3. Has anyone experienced something similar with a fairly new car?

Other facts about the car, it burns oil (I have been staying consistent with checking it, and the oil levels are good). There is also an oily, black film in the tail pipes (which lines up with the burning oil), I also know it is oily as, if it is touched, it does not rub off the fingers.

1n6v9o5,I have issues with my car which I don't know if they are serious,"Hi, 

this might be a bit long (I feel like the whole context is necessary sorry), but I want a bit of advice going forward just to get a bit of an idea, and to also give some more indications to any future mechanic that will have the pleasure of looking at the car, so any advice or potential leads is genuinely welcomed :) (I know a bit about cars but its seriously not my passion lol)

Me and my mom (live close together so we share the car) recently bought a used 2015 mini cooper countryman s (1.6L turbo engine, AWD) (not my choice, I tried to explain that BMW was not renowned for being super reliable, which is not the best for us since we live in Canada and I'd like a reliable car, but my mom was dead set on the cuteness of the car so now we have a cute car I guess) and from the vendors, the car had no problems but had only been driven twice in the last year. Other than that, all the mechanics reports have been all clean, they had just changed the brakes, batteries, etc.

So everything is great until this : 

10 days after we bought it, the starter failed which we had to get replaced asap for a road trip, so we went to BMW mini's dealership to get it replaced (lovely way to find out what a starter is btw). When the mechanic got into the car, they realized that 

1. a cable (not sure which) had to get replaced (not very important i think)
2. the engine's thermometer was leaking, which was not road safe, therefore we needed to get it replaced
3. the engine has a small oil leak (safe enough, I just need to check the oil level every 750 km, which I checked yesterday (post road trip) and is fine (colour and level), and the leak is not on the top of the engine anyway, but known to be on the same side of the serpentine belt (relevant later))

so we did 1 & 2 + the started which made the bank cry, but ok, we went on the road trip

EXCEPT

1.  on the report of the mechanic, they say that our serpentine belt needs to be replaced soon. which is worrying (just a bit :,))) because I currently do not have any information about the belt every being replaced in the past, but I also know they need to be replaced every \~100K km or so, and we are at \~170k km. (yay!) ->this is my main worry, since there's not a lot of info on the report and point #2 and #3 make me worry more
2. around 200km into our road trip, I had the engine light come (I did not freak out at all, we were all very calm (not)), which I pulled on a rest area and we figured out that the motor was hot (the hood was hot and when we let it rest for a bit, the light went away and never reappeared), which might have been caused by the fact that I dumbly didn't fully read the user manual and missed the fact that putting 89 might get the engine light (but its the grade written on the damn gas cap????) anyway, now on 91, the car is happy (there was also a bit of knocking on 89 but none on 91 so I guess the girl is just a fancy queen)
3. after the trip (it was probably around a good 700-900km) I noticed (was there before, but now made aware that it is not normal), that when at rest, my engine cannot just 'stay' at a certain rpm (I was told it was supposed to be around 600??). Mine just oscillates between 600 and 1200 rpm constantly, and basically its at 600 then you can hear the engine go and jump at 1200 (almost as if it was changing gears, or at least trying, by the sound of it), then it goes back down and starts again every 2 minutes or so

Oh also the radio is not working but eh details.

My main questions :

1. should I get the belt replaced asap (or at least before winter comes? especially since the temperatures are super weird right now and could be harsh on the belt's rubber)
2.  what would be the cause of the engine being weird at rest? Is it normal and I'm just freaking out? Is it because of the turbo (I really just only know how the thing works and what it does, not how to take care of it)?
3. is the small delay on the throttle be because of an issue the engine or it is just because its BMW and they all have a small delay (from what I know its that but now I'm nick picking everything)
4. me and my friends are also thinking of going on another road trip soon, so is it safe?

One side note is the dealership mechanics mentioned a small oil leak from the upper oil pan and recommended a crazy (and expensive) service to remedy it. To me it seemed like just a seal issue and it hasnt gotten worse in the years since.

1n6tmni,"Bought a used Sport Trac, broke down within an hour — fixable or did I get a lemon?","Hey all, looking for some outside perspective.

I picked up a used 2010 Sport Trac 4.0L V6 from a small dealership in Ontario last week. Within the **first hour** of driving it, a bunch of issues popped up:

* When picking it up, they mentioned the **battery light** had come on, so they quickly swapped it before handing me the keys. I thought, “nbd, maybe even a bonus.”
* After leaving the lot, the **pressure light** came on. A couple needed air, and one valve stem was seized. Not huge, but noted.
* About 45 minutes in, the **check engine light** came on and I got a **strong fuel smell** filling the cabin. The truck shook violently at idle.
* The **rough idle/vibration** was bad enough to feel like a massage chair and definitely noticeable from outside too.
* The **Bluetooth** stopped working. Minor, but worth mentioning.
* When I went to restart it for the tow, the **starter took several seconds** to engage, loud enough that the tow guy commented on it.

It had to be towed back the same day. The dealer just updated me saying the issue was a **stuck valve on fuel injector #6**, which explains the fuel smell, CEL, and rough idle. They’re “going over it” and say they’ll repair it under their dealer guaranty.

Here’s where I’m stuck:

* Is this injector valve issue a fairly simple/one-off fix? (Meaning the truck could be solid after repairs.)
* Or, given how much went wrong within an hour of leaving the lot, does this scream “shady safety cert” and possible ongoing problems?

The dealership is technically covering repairs, but I’m debating whether I should be pushing for a **refund/rescission** instead of trusting the fixes.

Would you:

* Push for a refund and walk away (feels lemon-y)?
* Let them fix it and see if it’s a one-time thing?

Any thoughts from mechanics or anyone who’s been through Ontario’s OMVIC process would be super appreciated.

**TL;DR:** Bought a used Sport Trac, within an hour: pressure light, CEL, strong fuel smell, rough idle/shaking, starter delay, Bluetooth dead. Dealer says it’s a stuck fuel injector valve (#6) and will repair under guaranty.

As long as they actually fix it and you pick it up and it does not have any codes or stored codes and runs well, you should be okay. 


It sounds like they had the truck on the lot. Not for very long. Slap the sales sticker on it and sent you on your way.  Battery light coming on generally means that the battery is below charge or that the alternator is not functional. 


A stuck injector could cause the flooding and bad running and symptoms that you're talking about. It's pretty rare but it can happen. 


Replacement of that injector plus a test drive, clear the codes and then run through drive cycle and you should be good to go.

A pipe like that isn't too hard to recreate.  I would use some various size sockets C-clamped to a table edge to do the bends.  You can get the flaring tool as a loaner tool from the chain auto parts stores, and possibly the cutter and bending tool as well.  Copper nickel tubing is easier to bend and flare than steel lines, and adequate for the pressures found in automotive braking.  You can probably clean up and reuse the original fittings.  You'll need to figure out what size tubing you need.  Being Toyota it's probably metric, but some American brands were using SAE sized lines later than you would think they would be.  Maybe they still are.

The replacement part doesn't have to be an exact copy.  It does have to be close enough to connect at both ends, flex as needed, and not rub against anything that would compromise the pipe.  

There's plenty of videos for how to cut, bend and flare brake tubing.

The smell might be from a little bit of oil may have dropped on a part that gets hot when the engine runs when they were filling it up.

If you see the two dots on the dipstick and the oil is solid up to about half way on the dots, that's how you see your oil level. 

As long as it's between the two dots you're good, in the middle of above is good.

If you get over the top dot and it's solid oil usually it's not a big deal unless it's like an inch or two above the top dot. It's more concerning if it's lower than the bottom dot or worse if it's not solid on the dipstick.

As for oil quality it's pretty see through which is fresh. Old oil looks black and you can't see through it. I hope this helps

Someone suggested the master cylinder may be going out since worn fluid could damage the internals. I switched it and thought I bench bled it enough, didn’t see any more bubbles. Installed it all and bled the system, still soft. I’ve gravity bled and pressure bled numerous times. I went through over 2 gallons of brake fluid. I even bled the ABS module a few times to try to find trapped air. I’m out of idea of why the pedal is still soft. I disconnected the brake lines from the master cylinder and ran hoses up to the reservoir to bleed it again.

I broke open the screw and went into the car to press the pedal. I bled from max to min on the reservoir for each tire to make sure I pushed any air all the way through. 

For pressure bleeding I bought a Motive Power Bleeder. Teflon on the adaptor and made sure it was an airtight fit. Pumped to 25psi and let it sit for 10min to make sure the system is sealed. After that I cracked open the bleeder and let fluid through."

I’m pretty sure this truck is a 1978 model, which I’ll outline below:

- This truck has drip moldings above the doors; this rules it out of being a 1973 model. Drip moldings became standard for the 1974 model year.

- The rear stepside fenders have side marker lamps in them; for the 1979 model year the rear side marker lamps moved and became integral with the tail light housing on the stepside bed. So this stepside box is from a 1973-1978 model.

- Notice the round fuel fill cap in the stepside fender; 1978 was the final year for this. GM trucks switched to a square door with concealed fuel fill neck in 1979.

- The hood has an additional small body line horizontal along the front facing edge; this hood with that additional body line was only used for the 1978, 1979, and 1980 model years.

- The headlight trim bezels drop down and surround the front park/signal lights; this bezel design was only used for the 1979 and 1980 model years. The front grille is obviously aftermarket/home made, so it’s not far fetched to assume that the headlight bezels were changed as well at the same time.

Given that the 1978 model year was the crossover for the hood, fuel filler, and rear side marker designs that we see here, I’m pretty confident that this truck is a 1978 model. It would have originally started life as a 1/2ton (6.5’ box), but somewhere along the line someone swapped 3/4ton axles under it.

She is moving to a different country and needs to sell the car. She was planning on selling it through local markets but then we got talking! I have a family with two kids in car seats . We have been looking for a used hybrid or plug in hybrid and we’re thinking something like a RAV 4. But then learned about my friend wanting to sell her car and what turned from a joke is now something I am seriously considering. She is offering it at well below blue book for us because we are really close friends and she has been meticulous with all maintenance checks. I trust her 1000% and know the car has been babied by her. Her family is a BMW family so she knows how to take care of them. She had brakes replaced and other minor things. Her mechanic who she trusts says no issues in sight in the car.

What I’m trying to figure out is what kind of expected maintenance is likely to pop up on a PHEV car like this between 100,000 and 150,000miles or even 200,000 miles if an electric bow can make it that long?

Your maintenance costs could very likely be close to what a lease payment would be on a new one.  So if you really like this model, just lease it instead.

I ask because the dial that controls outside lights only seems to have 4 positions.

* Off
* DRL or Parking lights
* Headlamps On
* Auto

I leave mine on Auto and that works for me.  But lately, at night when I’m behind other drivers, some of them have no lights illuminated on the back or sides of their car.  

Like tonight, I was behind some black sedan (didn’t catch the make/model) and every light on their tail was off.  They had some side lamps on, but other than that it was like they were invisible.  Being behind them, I couldn’t be positive if their headlights were on.  However, I knew the stretch of road we were on would soon curve to the right, and that I’d be able to see the state of their headlights. Sure enough, they were off.  I flashed my brights a couple of times, followed by turning my headlights off/on.  They got the message and turned their headlights on.  Unfortunately I forgot to note what their tail lights looked like, as they turned off the road right after this.

Do parking lights and DRL illuminate anything on the tail end?

It seems every time I’m driving at night on a highway, I see one of these “dark tailight” cars.  Sometimes they have side lights. Headlights, well I can’t always tell because I’m behind them.

After thinking about this for a few minutes, I guess the burning question I have is:

Assuming there’s no equipment problems; If you have your lights in anything other than the OFF position, shouldn’t your car’s taillights be illuminated and visible to people behind you?",1,1756790774.0,5,CarTalk,1756928058,2025-09-02 05:26:14,2025-09-03 19:34:18,"jim_br (Score: 2): As you found out, DRLs are front facing lights at an intensity that is less than full-on headlights.  No other lights are on.

If you want even more fun, some EVs with single pedal control enabled don’t light up the brake lights when the car is slowing down.  They only light up when the brake pedal is pressed.

04HondaCivic (Score: 1): The difference is DRLs are lower intensity lights that light up when the vehicle is on, running or in motion and they are always on regardless of day or night. The DRL acronym stands for Daytime Running Lights. Pioneered by GM in the 90’s it was supposed to increase daytime visibility. Now they seem almost ubiquitous across all manufacturers.  They will most often not light up the rear taillights when they are on and usually require no input from the driver to turn them on although the driver can often select to turn them off depending on the model of vehicle. 

Parking lights, often referred to as running lights usually utilize the taillights in rear and front lamps different from the headlamps. The parking lights could utilize the same lamp assembly as the DRLs or they could utilize a lower intensity turn signal lamp or they could be a totally separate assembly depending on how complex the front headlamps are. They will light up the rear taillights and can often be controlled by the headlight switch. 

Then there’s a full auto setting like you noticed and in that position, the vehicle uses light sensors and sometimes rain sensors coupled with the wiper switch to control the lights. You often never have to worry about turning on or off your headlights because the vehicle recognizes when you need lights and will turn them on or off for you. 

Newer vehicles headlights seem to be much more complex and confusing in how they handle a simple switch and it’s frustrating because people often don’t take the time to figure out how their lights work and you’ll see them going down the road in the dark with only the DRLs lit with no lights in the rear."

I first took it to a automatic car wash, and it damaged my paint with some scratches and what I can only describe as soap scum(?). After realizing that was a bad idea, I have started taking it to a self serve carwash so I could make sure the paint doesn't get damaged further. 

But after I recently washed it, I realized that a lot more chips have appeared. I can accept that I suck at washing my car, but I also know that I haven't been aggressive enough when washing it for there to be more paint chips. On top of all that, I have also realized that not only does one of the chips on the trunk have a bit of rust, but the trunk door also seemed kind of peppered when I got a closer look at it.

Automatic car washes are bad. 100% guarantee that they’ll scratch the clear coat. Self car washes can also be hazardous. The foam brush should never be used directly on the car, as that will also cause scratches. 

Do you have access to water at home? If yes, best option is to do it in the shade using the two bucket method, with at least a couple microfiber wash mitts. Use a dedicated car shampoo, preferably one that doesn’t have “wax” in it. Once washed, immediately dry off with microfiber towels to avoid water spots. Some folks even use a leaf blower to avoid the risk of scratches during the drying process. Once clean, consider applying a spray sealant. Turtle Wax Ceramic Spray Wax is one of the higher rated and most affordable options. This adds a layer of protection and enhances the gloss. It also makes washing the car even easier on future washes. Oh, if you don’t have access to water, the rinseless wash method is a good way to do maintenance washes when the car isn’t too dirty. There are tons of videos on YouTube. Apex Detail is one of the best. Brian, the owner, does a fantastic job explaining everything, regardless of skill level. He also covers plenty of budget friendly products. 

Your car is nearly 30 years old. Good on you for wanting to take care of it. At this point you want to keep it looking as nice as possible. There’s some money involved with getting the right gear. Other steps to consider are decontaminating the paint before applying the sealant/wax/ceramic. Good luck.

You might be able to improve the appearance of all this stuff, but first of all, I must say that you should never, ever take your car to an automatic car wash. They are notorious for making things worse. They have no finesse. You are going to want to hand wash your car. Maybe even do it twice. Go to the Meguiar’s website and see what they recommend. You don’t have to spend a lot on the basics.

A good wax buffing will help improve the overall condition of the paint. You’ll probably remove 90% of the oxidation. The chips will remain. There’s not much you can do about that. Unless you get some touchup paint, but even that is likely to leave noticeable spots."

Monitor the oil level closely. Every 500 to 1000 miles. For a car as old as yours adding a quart of oil every 3000 miles is likely normal. If you start needing 2 or 3 or oil stars pooling under your car. I would get the oil leaks fixed. The rear main will be expensive. 

Suspension: Does the car track true when you let go of the wheel? Is there play/input delay when you turn the wheel. It's an old car and will be a bit creaky and that's normal for an old car.

Got a problem with the bracket for the rear bushing of the front control arm on my VW CC 2013 2.0 TDI. It bolts to the subframe with two bolts, and the other side attaches to the body with a single M12. On one side, both bolts are broken — one completely, the other has about 1.5 cm left. Subframe is aluminum, ~4 cm thick.

I’ve already started drilling the fully broken bolt with a 5 mm cobalt bit. Thinking of using the old bracket as a guide to drill a new hole, maybe upgrade to M12/M14 and use a Helicoil or sleeve.

Anyone got tips on:
	•	drilling aluminum without messing it up?
	•	centering a new hole if the old one is slightly off?
	•	safely removing the remaining 1.5 cm of broken bolt?
	•	would one reinforced bolt be enough or should I do both?

If it fails, you can try to drill it or put in thread repair

NightKnown405 (Score: 1): Using a drill guide is the only real solution. First make sure to drill a pilot hole all the way through the bolt. The closer to the exact center and in perfect alignment the better. Then you  drill to the bolt holes original pre-threaded diameter. If you can, use a left handed drill bit for that. Sometimes the drill bit will grab and just spin the remainder of the broken bolt out for you. 

Once this is completed, then you can choose to clean up and reuse the original thread if possible, versus use a thread insert or going one step oversized. A helicoil is ok for an inline load but if there is any side to side loading it's not the best choice and a threaded insert would be better. 

There is one other solution if there is room for it. That would be drilling all the way through and then using a nut on the back side of the assembly. It would also be ok to use a nut and lock washer on the back side of the assembly if the thread mostly survives just for additional security if there is room."

Confirm with dealership it’s about $88 for an oil change. Get a text back an hour later with the inspection reports and a bill of $24 for a tire rotation. Talk to a guy saying I came for an oil change not a rotation so no idea why the rotation is the only “approved” item on the list that I did. Anyways 30 minutes later I get a call wanting to ask me questions about my oil housing. They claimed the previous mechanic overtightened it causing it to seize, it had cracked, and when the tech took it off it completely snapped off. They said I needed to pay for a new housing. I tried to look up some quick stuff and decided to go ask some questions to work on getting the cost reduced. I agreed that it looked like it was over tightened but it wasn’t leaking before and everything was fine prior to my arrival. The lead tech or something let me know he put a $50 credit on so I just said thank you and waited for the car to be done. 

Overall the second bill was under $200 (I had to send back the primal paperwork that charged me for the $24 tire rotation)

Looking back I feel like I should have mentioned if they saw it was cracked before taking it off they should have told me so I could have the original mechanic deal with it, instead of breaking it off then making me pay for new oil housing. Should I have fought more, did I get scammed?

It's sitting on Blizzack snow tires that I bought last December that have less than 2k miles on them, and stock 18"" VW rims in fair condition. I still have the receipts and can document the mileage on the tires, so I figure that I can get at least $500 out of my tires if I list them ahead of snow season and maybe another $350 out of the rims. Issue is I need the car to be able to roll onto the flatbed for donation, so I would need to replace the wheels if I do this. 

The tire shop quoted me $440 for the cheapest set of new tires in steel rims, out the door. I would likely make my money back going this route, but ideally I can find a cheaper set on Craigslist and make a bigger profit this way. Being able to use a smaller wheel would significantly open up my options since 235/45R18 is a bit harder to find and likely more expensive than a more generic wheel size. 

To reiterate, the car needs a complete engine replacement and does not drive. It only needs to sit on the wheels until my loan payoff is finalized and I get the title in the mail, and the radio station can arrange a pickup. 

Thank you in advance for any advice!

How do I replace the gasket and how do I get this bolted back together so it doesn't leak from the joint?

The bolts have completely rusted off one flange and the other flange is rusted to the nut which is all rusted to the flange. The nuts are so rusted they're really more cone shaped at this point. The flange on the right (with the rusted bolts in) can rotate completely around the pipe.

It also seems like I would have to replace a gasket in this joint but can't separate the two pipes much more than what is shown in the first picture.

I've tried split flanges but the bolts won't reach around the movable flange no matter how I spin it.

Yesterday's thermostat was a loose one. The thermostat requires the dexterity of a circus performer. It took me several tries to figure out the trick.

In order to get the ""cool sound"" from a turbocharged car, you need a BOV that vents to the atmosphere. When the turbo is generating boost and you let off the accelerator, the extra pressure is vented directly to the atmosphere, which is why you can hear the noises it makes.

The problem with this is that the engine's control systems carefully meter the air flowing into the engine, and changing the stock diverter system to a BOV will mess with the engine's measurements. This throws off your mixture, and can cause other problems.

Will it kill your engine? Not likely. Will it increase your maintenance costs overall? Yes, almost definitely.

Also, before the ""well acktually"" crowd shows up. I'm generalizing above. Some cars come with diverter valves, some come with blow-off valves, some meter air in a way that won't be affected by the change, but most don't. So if you want a really specific answer, we'll need more information than just a generalized question.

In general though, manufacturers invest a ton of money into engineering for modern engines. Aftermarket changes almost always involve some kind of trade-off. So if the car is new, or your budget is limited, it's better to leave the engine as it was designed from the factory.

1n6r9lh,"Vibrations between 45-60, what would cause?","Recently, I got a new tire put on and they let me know that the two back tires had some cupping. When they replaced the one, the other one didn’t have even a third as bad of cupping so I left it there for now. I had gotten three tires done at the same time and I know for certain 2/3 have cupping issues.  Could the cupping from my two passenger tires (rear confirmed cupping and front is the third tire)still be causing the shaking I’m feeling, or could it possibly be a CV joint?  I have noticed the shaking decrease a noticeable amounts since changing the one tire.  

I’ve noticed that on occasion, when I do a sharp left turn, I sometimes hear a clicking from the front left wheel. That tells me it could be a worn CV joint.    Otherwise there is zero shaking after like 60-64.  All engine struts are good and my transmission is also good.  Only things I can think of are either a cv joint or possibly the tire cupping.   

If it turns out to be the cv joint, the warranty I have should cover the fix in full. Could it quite possibly be a situation of *both things are true* and that I need to get new tires plus the cv joint is wearing?    I only ever hear the clicking if I gun through a tight left hand turn but otherwise just the shaking around 45-60.  

TL;DR.  Could the shaking between 45-60 more likely be cv joint related or more likely cupping tires ?

During a brake bleed or other brake maintenance, if the petal is pushed to the floor, the rust can cut the cup seal lips. This can lead to MC failure and if the brakes don't catch and the petal excursion is high, further damage occurs. When doing brake work, only use short strokes.

Brake fluid absorbs moisture and that is why brake bleeding should be done. One can do a partial bleed by replacing the only fluid in the reservoir routinely. That is better than nothing, low effort, low cost and quick.

-NOT_A_MECHANIC- (Score: 1): If an exchange is all you’re looking for, all you need to do is open the screw. That’s it.

1n6qmzn,Honda Civic Strut Pair or Single?,"So for as long as I’ve known vehicles the approach for struts has always been to replace them in pairs. I bought a new Honda civic last year (11th gen sport 2.0L no turbo) and I have a leaky strut that is covered under warranty. However they don’t cover the pair so if I want the pair I’ll have to pay out of pocket for the other front strut.

The problem is the out of pocket cost for the other strut is $525 which seems steep but multiple Hondas quoted me around that price.

The alignment is also covered under warranty so I’m thinking of just biting the bullet and paying for the other strut.

Here’s the wrench in all of this.

The Honda master mechanic at the dealership said I only needed to repair the leaky one and the other three should be fine since they should last well over 100k miles. He hasn’t inspected the other strut either he just said it wasn’t a problem since they’re meant to last so long and that I’m only at 41k miles. 

That goes against everything I’ve ever heard but I am not a master mechanic..

1n6m5fj,Are my tires cooked? How bad would it be to run winter tires instead?,"Howdy folks,

Had a blowout last night as a fun way to end Labor Day. Pulling the tire off and thinking about replacing the pair got me thinking that it may be time to replace the whole set. While they still have plenty of tread left, there's visible cracking between the treads on all 4. [See pictures here](https://imgur.com/a/Ws45WCB). This is a set of Yokohama Geolander G055 tires, and I have no idea how old they are (bought car secondhand, no receipt for tires). Is it time to replace these guys?

I have a full set of almost brand-new Bridgestone Blizzaks. I got these when I lived in the PNW and ran them for 2 seasons before moving back down to Georgia. Should I just throw those on instead of buying a new set? Or would that be a bad idea? It's still regularly reaching 90+ degrees down here, but I figure I have them, I might as well use them.

Thanks!

Even sometimes would work if I just jiggled the gear selector in park. A few times it has worked with me just moving the steering wheel around.

Then it started to make it hard to start the car. Like the key wouldn't turn all the way to start. I ended up getting a new ignition switch. Just the switch, for 20 bucks. Replaced it and everything went smoothly for a few days. Thought it was fixed. Well now it is back to doing the same thing. I dont have a problem starting it now, but the key wont come out sometimes. And now, unfortunately, this morning I tried for an hour to get it out and its stuck. So I just disconnected the battery and left it. Cause its just stuck in the on position. As always.

My 2005 Subaru Forester has one specific wheel that used to lose air pressure in its tire for no visible reason. The great local mechanic shop at the time fixed it by adding more...tire goop?...to the inside. IIRC the metal part was slightly uneven somehow, and a tiny gap air could escape through was prone to form.

They did it twice and then the wheel was perfect for the next 5 years.

Recently got a new set of tires (different brand) and that SAME wheel is once again refusing to keep a good seal. Its tire was at 16 psi recently -- pretty new still and no holes.

How do I explain this in technical terms to a different mechanic shop now? ""More tire goop please"" probably wouldn't go over well, lol, but it's the same problem in the same quadrant and probably needs the same fix.

I decided last week to take it to a mechanic that was recommended by a family friend and has exceptional reviews online. They told me that there are two leaks, one that would cost about $250 to repair, and the second would require the transmission be removed so it would cost about $1500 to repair. Since I wasn’t having any performance issues with the car, I agreed to do the “easy” repair, and I’d keep an eye on the second leak getting worse. Well, less than 50 miles later, I have had a massive loss of oil, the check oil light is on, and I obviously can’t drive the car so will have to tow it somewhere. I can’t help but suspect that they made the second leak worse so that I would come back for the $1500 repair, and now I don’t know what to do. They have such a good reputation, I feel like I should ask them to make it right, but they are probably going to claim that it’s a coincidence and they told me about the second leak, and if they DID screw up the first repair (intentionally or not), they will be able to hide it with my car back in their shop.

Getting your foot in the door at some independent or quick lube place might be possible and they might pay for some training for you but it wont be higher end training like going to UTI or something, it'll be basic small classes. 

A dealership might pay for the higher end training but you arent getting into a dealership as a tech without previous experience or without proving yourself. We have some trainees at our dealer who started with no experience but they started off as porters for like 1-2 years and proved they have a hustle and motivation to learn."
1n6i198,Inner door handle won’t work if I use interior door lock button - but works fine after opening door from outside (1996 Camry),"Recently acquired this beauty of a car and all the big parts work but I’m learning all the little quirks. Prior to the car, I had never done more than add oil to a car so I apologize if I ask something obvious. 

I’m a woman with street parking who gets in/out the car in the dark, so I’m used to getting in the car and locking the doors immediately. If I use the interior lock button, I can’t get back out of the car unless I roll the window down and open from the outside. Doesn’t matter if I unlock the door button inside a few times or relock. The handle itself moves nonissue but it doesn’t open the door. It works as normal if I don’t use the lock button. 

My key was sticking in the lock cylinder last week so I took off the panel to clean the lock and handles and all that. Everything of that works fine. 

The only part left that seems to stick is the rod but where it’s behind a plastic panel in the door and I can’t see or feel anything to see why it’s sticking. The rod attached to the lock cylinder sticks a bit too because the exterior handle doesn’t always sit flush unless I push it down. Since I cleaned that and felt it without the rod attached, I assumed all issues are both rods. 

Not sure how to get to those as the part I figured has issues is behind the little plastic box under the door handle. I had sprayed the anti-sticking lube a bit where I could but idk if it reached anything. 

Any help is greatly appreciated - thank you. ",2,1756815871.0,3,AskMechanics,1756928058,2025-09-02 12:24:31,2025-09-03 19:34:18,Brewersfan223 (Score: 2): Child lock??

1n6d119,Torque converter/transmission question,"I’ve recently driven 4 cars with automatic transmissions using a torque converter:
	•	S-Class W222 diesel (S350d)
	•	E-Class W213 diesel (E220d)
	•	Lancer 1.8 CVT
	•	Suzuki SX4 1.6 CVT

Both the Mitsubishi and Suzuki use the same Jatco CVT (but with different software).
One thing I noticed is that setting off in the Mercedes feels much smoother, although it seems like the car is making more effort.

In the Suzuki and Mitsubishi, if you don’t operate the throttle gently and with almost surgical precision, both cars tend to set off quite suddenly and abruptly — almost like suddenly dumping the clutch. By comparison, in both Mercedes models I felt the engine revving much higher during take-off, and the launch was noticeably smoother.

Could this be related to the Mercedes having a higher-stall torque converter? If so, why didn’t Jatco or Suzuki/Mitsubishi go for a higher-stall converter as well, given how much smoother it makes the car feel?

I also noticed a similarly smooth take-off in a Jeep Liberty 3.7.",0,1756797882.0,4,AskMechanics,1756928058,2025-09-02 07:24:42,2025-09-03 19:34:18,"None (Score: 1): [deleted]

Second owner, bought at \~40k around nine years ago (think it was a rental in it's previous life).  I've noticed it having a little trouble starting last week or two, but nothing major.  Sunday night driving on the freeway, it starts chugging and stuttering.  Slight surging at idle (between 500-800 rpm).  Check engine light comes on, but could still drive at freeway speed (but accelerate like JUNK).

Rolled the window down in the neighborhood and it sounded very similar to my 40 year old pickup when it dropped a cylinder.  Took to AutoZone and had the code red, misfire cylinder 3.  Bought new coils and plugs.

Attached is what I pulled out.  Apologies they are NOT in order.  The one on the left was cylinder TWO (not three, the one throwing the fault).  Also, when I pulled plug #2 out it was loose.  Like, hand loose.  I tested after just replacing coil 3 and it wasn't fixed.  Replaced all 4 and now it runs fine (though check engine light still on).

My question.  I sent this picture to my brother basically saying ""think I found the problem"" and he responded with ""could be blow back.""  The residue is dry, but I imagine it could be oil that's just baked.  **Does this** ***look*** **like a bigger issue, or just a coil that was on a loose plug?**

I know almost nothing about mechanics, EXCEPT when something breaks.  I know how to work on AC blowers, window lifters, brakes, etc.  As things break, I learn about it.  This is my first ignition problem so I'm starting blank here.

The only major hiccups I’ve had with it is I’ve replaced the valve gasket because it was leaking oil (?), replaced the battery twice in the 10 years of owning it, and replaced the tires before too. Other than that, just regular oil changes. :-)

After him and I have taken ownership of the car I have taken it to the mechanics for some much needed maintenance from the right places and quality parts. I had recently taken his car to a Valvoline for an oil and filter change, I bought full synthetic and when I got the sticker it said it should be changed in 3k miles. My family and I have always gone by the rule of 5k miles enough to get use from the oil but never so much to damage the engines. 3k seems a little on the conservative side of replacement so my question is should I go 5k miles from when I got the oil change to begin with or should I just go in and replace it at the 3k mile mark as the sticker suggests.

1n6x9s7,Bought a qashqai despite hate,"I am a young driver who’s been driving my mums 2019 vw up for the last 2 years. It’s a phenomenal car and I enjoyed every moment of it. I simply feel uneasy taking it to uni as it’s worth nearly 11000£ due to its spec and mileage. Additionally my uni house next year is an area that is very unsafe for cars I decided to go to for a car that is much less in value for my peace of mind. I also decided that I wanted a bigger car than an Up without a doubt due to the expected large amounts of motorway driving from home to uni city back atleast twice a week. VW golf, Skoda fabia, VW polo, fiat 500L/500X, ford fiesta, ford focus etc. were some of the cars I considered. I placed a firm £5000 on the budget and looked for cars THAT WAS FAVOURABLE to insurance. I am not a racer, I just want a car that’ll accelerate comfortably to 70 and drive A to B. 

A trend I seemed to notice was that 1.0/1.2 L vw golf/ ford focus and 1.0/1.2L vw polo/fiesta class of cars were resulting in greater insurance premiums than a comparable compact SUV such as the Nissan qashqai, Kia sportage, Peugeot 3008, Ford Kuga/Ecosport and Renault Captur and Ford Kuga but SPECIFICALLY with a 1.2L engine. The smallest you can get with these cars (except the sportage whose 1.6L the insurance didn’t mind for some odd reason). The Renault captur was even lower at 0.9. With the added benefit of a raised seating position and more comfortable drive, I decided to get one of these instead. 


Now I hear you, parking will be trouble but when you consider that a golf / focus are only 5-7 cm shorter in length than a qashqai or a captur, with the same width I did not mind. Now, between the SUVs, I didn’t mind the size. I’m the only one driving it. Renault Captur and Kadjar, Nissan Qashqai and the Peugeot 3008 were the only ones I could consider within my budget, mileage and engine constraints.

Kia sportage was a close contender however, only pre 2013 versions came under my budget and my mileage requirement and they are not ulez compliant if I remembered correctly.

Qashqais have an absolute bad rep in the sub and generally too. Out of three cars, the 1.2 qashqai from 2015 was the one with THE BEST insurance premiums. Keeping in mind I AM A 19y/o YOUNG DRIVER, the insurance was £700-800 cheaper on the qashqai than the Captur, Peugeot 3008 and the vw polo/ford fiesta and vw golf/ford focus class of cars. The kadjar wasn’t much more expensive but I felt the car was simply just too much on the large size, being 8 cm longer than qashqai which itself is 8 cm longer than a golf/focus. 

Despite the the horrible online reviews I’ve read online about this car, I test drove it, it was a great ride, had a great interior, had its timing chain changed out just recently and the car was in good condition and only 10 years old for the £5000. And the engine accelerated to 70 comfortably enough. I couldn’t complain. 

My car choice was made with a utilitarian decision making process as the ethics professors would say /s

I want some tips for getting skilled at parking, especially now that I’m switching from to the tiny up to the qashqai.

Unsurprisingly for an 8 year old car with 87k on the clock, insurers are saying it is a total loss / Cat S.  

The challenge is that it is a really rare spec of car - Skoda Fabia diesel estate automatic - of which there are only 3 for sale on Autotrader at the moment.  None are comparable mileage or age - one is a year older but similar miles, no stated service history (£7k), two others are a year newer and 15k less mileage (£8.7k) and the other 30k less mileage (£10k).  

Based on this, I think it would cost me about £7.5k to buy a like for like replacement, if one was available on the market.  The third party’s insurer today offered me £6.2k, rising to £6.6k after a few minutes of discussion.

I'm in the process of rejecting a car I bought 2nd hand, I've written a full rejection letter and have started to get a law firm involved as they've rejected everything - which I expected them to do.

I bought the car partly though my credit card and the rest on debit, so I've raised a section 75 to try and fight from two angles.

To cut a long story short, I picked up the car, drove it home, all was fine. 3 days in a transmission light came on and it went into limp mode, I told the dealer, said I'm rejecting it on the basis of this happening so soon. The car also didn't come with a rear passenger belt buckle which was an MOT failure. I stopped using it, the battery was completely flat 3 days later and it required a jump to get going. I returned the car and left it there. It also leaked oil onto my drive which I noticed after the return.

The dealer has rejected, saying the limp mode and fault light was caused by the dead battery. They also put in writing that it isn't leaking any oil.

I then gave them a final reminder before legal action, to which the responded saying the buckle was there, it was just tucked away. I checked below the seats and it wasn't bolted in before returning, so they've fixed this stating it was always there. This was 10 days after they had the car, and 2 weeks after I informed them of the missing buckle.

What are my chances of winning this if I take it to court? I've got a video of the limp mode and warning lights, as well as the fresh drips of oil on my drive.

Latest update is the warranty team has to decide what they will fix and there's no timeframe for this.

If they fix one or two issues, can I allow them to proceed and then excercise my right to reject? Because the car isn't road worthy unless all serious faults are repaired and from what i've read I must allow them 1 chance.

Then of course the wait to actually get one. You're looking at 3-6 months on average . 

The advantage of getting a fresh import is that the pound has been strengthening against the yen for a while (hence you see more imports in the last few years). So you could get a better deal than someone who imported five years ago when a pound got you 135 yen rather than near 200 today.

Downside is if an import has been running here for a while it is a bit of a known entity. Your self sourced one could be a dog.

In general also consider the need to get stuff fitted to make UK road legal. Depends on the car (a VW should be less work) but you need reversing lights, mph speedo, immobiliser etc. Had someone on here recently whose insurer insist they fitted an aftermarket immobiliser even though the car had one. 

Also potential higher insurance, harder to sell on, no buyer protections etc. 

I think the paperwork isn't really the main issue. It's just processes and forms. If you have no problem doing a tax return it shouldn't be much harder.

My car was hit today while parked at Portway Park and Ride (Bristol) between 07:20 and 17:20. Someone left a note saying they’d scratched it with their number, but the phone number doesn’t connect. I even tried a few close variations in case I misread it — still nothing.

The car’s fairly high mileage, so I’m worried that if I go through insurance they’ll just write it off. I’d rather avoid that if possible.

My job means I am in a lot of different places throughout the week and typically requires a moderate amount of driving. I know I could get a cheap runner but frankly I don't want to. I want some creature comforts, I want a reliable vehicle and I want something with a bit of welly. Does this look good/what should I look out for? Any and all advice is welcome and received gratefully.

P.S. I am a self-proclaimed imbecile when it comes to cars. I wish I knew more but it is not something that overly fascinates me other than when it comes to getting ripped off. Please treat me as such.

My history with purchasing cars is absolutely torrid. Sounds stupid but I lost my father (who was the only car/mechanicy person in the family) when I was 19 and all of my car purchases have come after that and so I feel pretty inept at this all and also quite alone. I bought a 17 plate Astra from what I can only describe as a dodgy car salesman in Burton. This was with my allocation of my Dad's pensions money for close to 8 grand outright and it was basically a complete rip off. The oil tank (idk the terminology) had some sort of leak upon purchasing and it was seeping into the engine's pistons. I was given a warranty but they were useless, and the salesman was equally as unhelpful. Fast forward 8/9 months from purchase and the car was completely unusable and I ended up scrapping it for about £400. Not a good start but a valuable lesson.

I then decided, forced by means and also learned from experience, that I would get something vastly cheaper as my second car purchase. I opted for a 2 grand 64 plate Peugeot 208 off Facebook marketplace from a girl who was raising money to go inter-railing. I thought at the very least this person would be trustworthy. Maybe they were, maybe they weren't. After a week of driving an engine light came on, OBD reader said it was something to do with catalytic converter. I searched up on google and people said mostly it was ignorable. So that's what I did for about 18 months. It served me fairly well driving up and down the M6. Alas, upon its most recent MOT I could not find the OBD reader to turn off the engine lights and the mechanics couldn't manage to do it for some reason, so it failed. Moreover, for whatever reason the engine has now started to struggle turning over upon starting it. I am going to get a re-test and switch off the engine light to hopefully blag the MOT. However, I was already thinking of getting a newer, more reliable vehicle anyways and this seems a perfect sign.

I have always been fond of SEATs. I like the way they look and from everyone I know who drives one, they seem to be  reliable vehicles. If you read my history, I imagine you would not be shocked to learn I am slightly paranoid about buying another broken car. I am looking at this dealer specifically because of their AA guarantee. I am a 22yo man with no kids and recently graduated. My interim job is in events whilst I prepare for Sandhurst next September. This job means I am in a lot of different places throughout the week and typically requires a moderate amount of driving. I know I could get a cheap runner but frankly I don't want to. I want some creature comforts, I want a reliable vehicle and I want something with a bit of welly. Is this a good pick?

Ad found on autotrader, website shows they hold stock of around 30 cars etc. Looked legit as a car trading business. I loved the car, so fell into the emotional side (yes lesson learned) and paid a deposit. Got home and the 'invoice' didn't have a VAT number on it - fine could be a sole trader, but there was no invoice number, date of transaction etc. So small alarm bells (and feeling stupid because I missed it all) So looked them up on companies house and not there - again could be a sole trader. Asked for the VAT number and got given the wrong one and they advised they would send the proper one when back in the office. Did some digging around and theres 3 businesses registered to the unit address, non are car sales. Differing variations of his name and I find several dissolved car businesses over the years and new ones started afterwards and then some old reviews of faulty cars, not fulfilling warranty claims etc. Also a history of short lived advertising and mail order businesses. So yep sounds dodgy AF. Eventually get a VAT number from them, its different to the business account name. So I wonder why the delay in providing the VAT number and legal name of the business and why wouldn't he provide proper invoices with legal invoice numbers, legal and trading as name, purchase date, payment account details etc. Just trying to figure out what he's up to really, is there a chance he was trying to sell as a private seller pretending to be a dealer or something else?

CARLOCK_Car_Security (Score: 1): Relay attacks are unfortunately pretty common with keyless entry systems, and a steering lock alone isn’t always enough to stop determined thieves. You were likely “lucky” they didn’t manage to take the car because either they were interrupted, struggled to fully bypass the ignition/start system after removing the lock, or decided it was taking too long and moved on.  


Turning off Keyless Go and keeping your fob in a Faraday pouch is one of the best steps you can take to prevent the relay signal from being picked up in the first place. That forces thieves to try a physical break-in instead, which is noisier, riskier, and generally takes more time.   
  
Adding multiple layers of protection (steering locks, immobilizers, trackers with real-time alerts) is the right approach to securing your car against theft. You can’t rely on just one system, especially not the factory ones.

1n6mca4,airbag-less steering wheel,"hi!! 
i have been considering an airbag-less wheel for my car (i’m going down the track route but also “dailying” the car too. i don’t drive it too often but when i do it’s usually motorway driving or scenic drives around the countryside/backroads, or to like a big tesco.) 
I’m trying to put together a positives vs negatives list in terms of doing it, especially with a removable boss kit (from NRG). 
i specifically want to do it because it’s something i’ve always wanted to do since i was a kid, i know it’s not particularly safe at all, but i know the early first generation mazda mx5 came without a driver airbag from factory, so i was trying to see it in that way, and to clarify it is mostly for the way it looks and feels. i’d track it as often as i could but that’d likely be 4-6 times a year i reckon at most. 
By the time id have the airbag-less wheel i would also have done an IAM course and id be trying to improve on my driving and awareness everyday to prevent issues/accidents as much as possible. 
any input/thoughts would be v appreciated!! 

(also i know cars that come with an airbag once removed makes it likely to fail MOT, but i dont know how true this is, if i bypass the airbag light it should still pass as it keeps the passenger airbag still functional) 

Edit:
thanks for the feedback, its pushed me much further into the don’t than the do side of things. it really just isn’t worth the risk of especially considering that despite all my efforts to be a good driver, others will still make mistakes that i can’t account for and that’s normal human error and at times incompetence. if i want a bagless wheel i should either have a second car i daily instead or have a half cage at least with other important safety features and a helmet.

I took it to a local garage who told me to visit autoglas at one of those pop-ups outside Halfords. They promptly told me they wouldn't do it and also could not tell me the glue they used when replacing a windscreen. I gave up and visited VW to ask and they quoted £385 for it to be repaired which is scandalous IMO. 

So short of ""accidentally"" chipping the windscreen and having my insurance do a full replacement I'm at a lost end. 

TLDR: recommend me windscreen glue that can withstand sub-Saharan temperatures and hold the weight of a bag of sugar. ",1,1756806503.0,1,CartalkUK,1756928058,2025-09-02 09:48:23,2025-09-03 19:34:18,"Racing_Fox (Score: 1): I think you can buy glue for this.

1n6e8ni,Being targeted,"Hi all, I have been keyed once again (2nd time in a month, 3 times in total in 3 months) and i'm starting to think i'm getting targeted with this. The only places yesterday I've been is at home and my mums house, the way I park at home is along a road that has no drives, residential houses, or blocking anything, passenger side to road and there was no scratch. When I went to my mums house in which i go often, she lives 2 minute drive down, however I park in a parking bay for the residents (which ive attempted to draw to make a bit of sense on 2nd slide) however its easy to walk through and key. I am going to start parking on the other side however my mother's new partner has started parking and has also been keyed in the same spot, same distance etc. 

The neighbour has always had an issue with us, breaking my mums nose about 7 years ago due to my mum asking a kid not too throw berries at my brother (the kid was a relative i believe of said neighbour), also being a neighbour that threw rubbish from our bins we left for binmen into my garden and getting her 3 year old at the time to help, now recently she felt ""threatened"" due to my mum having a small BBQ type of fire in the back garden with her partner and my sister, resulting in the police being called and in which she is going to be tracked for anger management with help of social services due to her having a young kid, also some sort of restraining order or so (not in effect yet), if she interacts with us again, goes in our garden she could be prosecuted. To add the keying on both mine and mums partners car happened shortly after this situation.

In the drawing, C = Car, N = Neighbour, O = Me along with all the top being houses and the green being small green fields in which a lot of people let their dogs loose as its locked off.

However you can easily walk through the car parking as there is a supermarket not too far and people would take it as a cut through. We are getting cameras installed however its a bit difficult to see the cars due to the angle of our house being in a corner, I am going to start parking on the right side as nobody walks through that part and recording my car after every time i exit my car.

Is there any way I can get a small camera sort installed to my wing mirrors? Like Tesla does for example, I know there is parking mode dash cams and I do want to invest in one soon, however just started a new job and won't be getting paid until the end of this month. However i am also looking at additional options.

Thank you all, sorry for the rant!

1n6dcli,Issues with claim details on CUE,"I was wondering if anyone has any experience with getting details on the Claims Underwriting Exchange (CUE) corrected? 

If you have, how easy/hard was it? 

Basically I'm gearing up for a fight and want to know ahead of time whether it's going to be a stressful process that I need to prepare for, or whether it's pretty smooth and easy. 

If you're interested in the background, it's below. But it's not necessarily relevant to my question overall.


The background is that I just purchased a new insurance policy and the provider (RAC) has come back and said there's an issue with the details I gave them. Long story short, on 1/07/2020 my wife was hit by another driver while she was driving my car. We claimed from Admiral, and the matter was settled. We've since insured 2 cars continuously and never had an issue, but the RAC are now saying that the details I gave them when getting my quote don't match CUE. 

They say the claim for my wife driving on the 1/07/2020 matches CUE, they don't have a problem with that. But they're saying CUE also says there's a claim on the 1/07/2020 for when I was driving the same car. 

So clearly theres an issue because we didn't both claim to be the driver of the same car on the same accident on the same day. I've emailed Admiral asking them to confirm we only submitted one claim and that was for my wife driving. But I've no idea when I'll hear back from them.
