1osux3m,1985 Mercedes 300SD won't start after sitting for ~18 months,"Hello!



My father in law recently passed (don't feel bad, he was kind of a jerk), but my part in helping the family will be to assist in selling his cars. One won't be an issue, but the other is a 1985 Mercedes 300SD (deisel). After it happened and the family met at his place to discuss who wants what, I started kicking the (round things), cleaning it out and whatnot... I didn't try to start it or anything then.



Wife and I went back last week to hopefully bring it home and it's straight up dead-dead. Putting the key in leads to no noise, no lights, doesn't even attempt to turn over... Obviously at least needs a battery. We didn't try to jump start it due to how it's parked and lacking long enough cables. I was there to deal with his other car first anyway, so we put this off until next week-ish.



My big question is this... Next time we go over there, I'm going to replace the battery and try to get it running again. What are some things I can plan for as ""likely to prevent a 1985 deisel mercedes from starting after sitting for \~18 months""? That's kind of broad, I know, but he lived 90 minutes away and I want to minimize going back week after week... Is there something I can bring that will save myself time and effort? Someone said to always keep a spare fuel filter since they are like $6 and easy to replace... Any other ideas like that?",1,1762722718.0,5,MechanicAdvice,1762803427,2025-11-09 21:11:58,2025-11-10 19:37:07,"tomhalejr (Score: 1): You really don't want to preemptively try and ness with it much. Make sure it has oil in it, that there's coolant in it, let the glow plugs cycle several times, and try it.

If you can't get it going, and you're not a diesel tech, it's better to just stop there and think about how you want to proceed from there. It's better to leave it in ran when parked as far as you know condition, then start getting into things yourself and adding variables.


If you can't  get it going, and if you don't want to keep it, if you sell it as, or donate it, then it doesn't cost you anything. If you do, then the biggest gamble is the cost of a tow and inspection, to find out what's going on with the vehicle.

first thing I would check is the fluid level. low coolant level doesn't have enough pressure to get to the heater core. if it gets warm at higher rpms, that is a likely candidate. second thing to check is air locking. if the coolant refill wasn't done with vacuum you could have air trapped in the system. if you can hear water gurgling sounds from behind the dash, you probably have air trapped. you can ""burp"" the system without too much difficulty.

If you use low octane fuel in an engine that requires more, there is a knock sensor that reads the knock and the ecu retards the spark a bit until the knock goes away.


A typical engine will fire the spark plug 10 or 20 degrees before the piston reaches the top of the bore. That number depends on a lot of things...rpm, load, temperature, cam timing and fuel octane so it varies a lot. If knock occurs at 17 degrees of advance, the ecu drops it to 15, or 12 or 10.... whatever it takes to stop the knock.

PoopsExcellence (Score: 2): In basic terms, a delayed spark means less time spent in combustion, which means less energy released overall and lower chamber temperatures. Think of it this way, if you delay the timing too much, then you'll end up with incomplete combustion as the end of the combustion overlaps with with exhaust stroke.

TheCamoTrooper (Score: 1): Pistons are attached to a rod that is a fixed length, they do not go up higher or lower in the block. Timing as a whole changes when the valves open in relation to the crank and thus the pistons position in its travel. Ignition timing just controls when your spark plug goes off to ignite the fuel, by retarding the timing it reduces peak compression as normally the spark goes off a little before TDC meaning you are compressing a burning fuel thus increasing compression, by putting the spark a little later it burns less before the piston does it's combustion stroke"

•	The before alignment sheet shows the rear right wheel was the one out of spec, while the rear left looked okay. Yet the rear left tire is the one that’s most worn on the inner edge.

•	They did the alignment, and now everything’s “in the green”, but it looks like they only barely got there, the toe and camber are just within the limits.

Friction (brushes), water pressure, and chemicals. When you remove one of those from the equation like a touchless car wash does, the other two factors have to be adjusted to compensate. So a touchless car wash is a lot less likely to knock off a mirror cap but you are getting a much lower concentration of chemical (more chemical, less water) than you need at a typical conveyor wash. Properly calibrated, it shouldn't be an issue but you are getting much stronger chemicals on your car at a touchless wash and if diluted improperly, they can definitely flash a rim or even the paint sometimes.

1osafty,Whole Car Shakes When Braking,"Hello!

  
For the last few months, my whole car will shake when braking, and its intensity seems to mainly coincide with how hard I'm braking. However, it does not affect my steering at all. I do sometimes notice this... lurching-esque feeling(?) when slowly coming to a stop, like I'm being pushed at a rhythm as I slow down. However, it's one of those things you feel once out of nowhere and don't feel again for the next few weeks, so it makes you feel crazy... I hope that's not just a me thing😅

It never really concerned me since I could make it a lot less prevalent by just downshifting as I'm slowing down to engine brake (obviously requiring less brakes to come to a stop), but I want to address it just in case (and it's a tad embarrassing when I have other people in my car lol).

Initially, I had chalked it up to unbalanced tires, but it is still present after having gotten brand new tires, if a tiny bit less harsh.

I'm pretty certain that my control arm bushings (and/or ball joints?) on the front are bad, given the clunk when going over bumps/dips a little quick, but I have no idea as to whether this would also fix this issue or not. Really, I'd like to address these issues at the same time, so that I don't have to put multiple days off towards these fixes lol.

For some info, my front rotors and all four pads were replaced by the dealer when I got the car (about 24k miles ago, or a year and some change), and I did the rears about another 2-5k miles after, or a year even---the dealer said the rear rotors were ""just good enough to keep""... hence why they were changes at another time. 

I wouldn't think that any of the brake components would need replacing so soon, but I do a lot of in-city driving and am pretty spirited lol, so I guess that I wouldn't be super surprised.

Also, I saw that might struts might have a slight leak, if that could be a contribution, at all.

Anecdotally (i.e. never seen or heard anyone else do this) if I get my brakes extremely hot, I try to avoid leaving the pads in contact with the rotors in the same spot for very long. Like at a red light, I'll come to a stop and just put the car in park to hold it in place instead of keeping my foot on the brakes.

717Luxx (Score: 2): yo everybody says it's warped rotors BUT there's another possibility. 

uneven brake pad material deposits can feel like a warped rotor. this can happen when you sit on your brakes while they're hot. such as sitting at a red light after some spirited driving or a long downhill where you used your brakes to modulate speed for an extended period of time. 

to check (and fix) if this is the issue, you can do the brake pad/rotor break-in protocol again. I'll do several hard spots from 60kmh down to 10kmh about 10 times, never coming to a full stop. 

if this is the case, you can prevent it by, when you have to remain stopped after putting a lot of heat into your brakes, leaving enough space to roll forward or backward very slowly, so the pads don't sit on one spot. also not riding the brakes downhill will help. 

if they are warped, it's a matter of replacing pads and rotors, no big deal. this commonly happens when you get the rotors really hot, like outlined earlier, and then splash through a puddle. this quenches your rotors and can warp them.

A typical engine will fire the spark plug 10 or 20 degrees before the piston reaches the top of the bore. That number depends on a lot of things...rpm, load, temperature, cam timing and fuel octane so it varies a lot.

I drove another 160 miles last night before stopping, and while it beeped the whole way, I didn’t notice any issues operating the car or anything with the audio system.

The owner’s manual only mentions “beep” regarding the touch screen sound notifications for calls or texts, and a “series of 5 beeps” to indicate an issue with the crash detection system.  Not quite what I’m hearing here.

Any ideas what’s causing the beep?",1,1762722083.0,4,CarTalk,1762803427,2025-11-09 21:01:23,2025-11-10 19:37:07,"buttlicker-6652 (Score: 2): Are you sure this isn't an aftermarket alarm system?

1osuaeb,"Uneven rear tire wear on 2025 Toyota Sienna – I have inner wear on the rear left, but only the right side was out of alignment?","I’ve got a 2025 Toyota Sienna FWD with about 20k miles. I recently noticed the inner edge of my rear tires wearing unevenly, especially on the rear left side. The rear right shows some inner wear too, but nowhere near as bad.

I went in for an alignment and got the before and after printout.

Here’s what’s confusing me:

•	The before alignment sheet shows the rear right wheel was the one out of spec, while the rear left looked okay. Yet the rear left tire is the one that’s most worn on the inner edge.

•	They did the alignment, and now everything’s “in the green”, but it looks like they only barely got there, the toe and camber are just within the limits.

My questions: 

1.	Do the before measurements actually explain why my left rear wore as much as it did and worse than the rear right tire? 

2.	Does the new alignment look good enough to stop the inner wear going forward,

Friction (brushes), water pressure, and chemicals. When you remove one of those from the equation like a touchless car wash does, the other two factors have to be adjusted to compensate. So a touchless car wash is a lot less likely to knock off a mirror cap but you are getting a much lower concentration of chemical (more chemical, less water) than you need at a typical conveyor wash.

1osafty,Whole Car Shakes When Braking,"Hello!

  
For the last few months, my whole car will shake when braking, and its intensity seems to mainly coincide with how hard I'm braking. However, it does not affect my steering at all. I do sometimes notice this... lurching-esque feeling(?) when slowly coming to a stop, like I'm being pushed at a rhythm as I slow down. However, it's one of those things you feel once out of nowhere and don't feel again for the next few weeks, so it makes you feel crazy... I hope that's not just a me thing😅

It never really concerned me since I could make it a lot less prevalent by just downshifting as I'm slowing down to engine brake (obviously requiring less brakes to come to a stop), but I want to address it just in case (and it's a tad embarrassing when I have other people in my car lol).

Initially, I had chalked it up to unbalanced tires, but it is still present after having gotten brand new tires, if a tiny bit less harsh.

I'm pretty certain that my control arm bushings (and/or ball joints?) on the front are bad, given the clunk when going over bumps/dips a little quick, but I have no idea as to whether this would also fix this issue or not. Really, I'd like to address these issues at the same time, so that I don't have to put multiple days off towards these fixes lol.

For some info, my front rotors and all four pads were replaced by the dealer when I got the car (about 24k miles ago, or a year and some change), and I did the rears about another 2-5k miles after, or a year even---the dealer said the rear rotors were ""just good enough to keep""... hence why they were changes at another time. 

I wouldn't think that any of the brake components would need replacing so soon, but I do a lot of in-city driving and am pretty spirited lol, so I guess that I wouldn't be super surprised.

Also, I saw that might struts might have a slight leak, if that could be a contribution, at all.

For the final bit of info, should it be needed, it is a 2017 Subaru BRZ Limited (RWD) w/ a manual transmission.

If you drive hard enough for your brakes to get super hot, and then hold the brakes for some time, the heat will make the pads deposit an uneven amount of material on the rotor after you let go of the brakes (now the rotor is warped). 

Anecdotally (i.e. never seen or heard anyone else do this) if I get my brakes extremely hot, I try to avoid leaving the pads in contact with the rotors in the same spot for very long. Like at a red light, I'll come to a stop and just put the car in park to hold it in place instead of keeping my foot on the brakes.

717Luxx (Score: 2): yo everybody says it's warped rotors BUT there's another possibility. 

uneven brake pad material deposits can feel like a warped rotor. this can happen when you sit on your brakes while they're hot. such as sitting at a red light after some spirited driving or a long downhill where you used your brakes to modulate speed for an extended period of time. 

to check (and fix) if this is the issue, you can do the brake pad/rotor break-in protocol again. I'll do several hard spots from 60kmh down to 10kmh about 10 times, never coming to a full stop. 

if this is the case, you can prevent it by, when you have to remain stopped after putting a lot of heat into your brakes, leaving enough space to roll forward or backward very slowly, so the pads don't sit on one spot. also not riding the brakes downhill will help. 

if they are warped, it's a matter of replacing pads and rotors, no big deal. this commonly happens when you get the rotors really hot, like outlined earlier, and then splash through a puddle. this quenches your rotors and can warp them.

Tonight, (the next day) I checked the rear on the affected side, and found identical excessive inside wear. I hear no clunking, degraded handling and no impacts or accidents. Should I chalk this up to a shoddy alignment? Both lefts are in good shape, albeit almost up to the wear bars. I intend  to swap the rears for the time being as well and run them. I have a lifetime alignment policy at Firestone for the vehicles lifespan as well and try to drop in before big trips or every once in a while, so this has me perplexed- I keep on my vehicles MX relatively well.

Also, should I take this in preemptively before new tires and get an alignment or just wait until after the new compliment of rubber is on?

That would be from overinflating the tire. there is more wear in the groove on the right than the left which could be from the alignment which was thrown off from the worn or failed sway bar links. 

Always install the new tires first and then get the alignment checked ASAP. If you do the alignment with abnormally worn tires, that can throw off the readings. If you have any questions about the quality of the alignment, tell them you want a before and after print out of the readings."

The radial movement (oscillation when driving) on the other hand is most definitely NOT normal and is likely the cause of your vibration. 

Hard to guess what happened here if everything is bolted down correctly. Possibly you slid the axle splines out of the transmission when working on the control arm? If so fixing it should just involve lining up the inner shaft and pushing it back into the transmission. Definitely don’t drive it in this condition, could do some nasty damage to the trans.

If dealership, tell them you want an out of the door price, do not let them suck you into silly add ons (they will push hard on this stuff, anti corrosion systems, extra warranty etc etc” you can usually get your own extended warranty elsewhere for cheaper. 

If you’re looking at a specific car, research it a bunch. Watch YouTube videos on it, make it so you look like you’re knowledgeable about cars to an extent. 

Biggest thing, do not let them push you into something you aren’t 100% comfortable with, it’s there job to do so and it’s your right and power to get up and walk away. More times than not they will call back and potentially offer you closer to what you had asked for.

If you want reliable look into Honda and Toyota. But do your research not every one of their cars is reliable.

Honda makes their own transmissions and uses ZF while the ZF models are not great. 

Find a good local mechanic and ask for advice too. 

My advice, find a private sale with someone who clearly looks after their car. Arrange your own financing in advance. When you do find the car tell the seller you want your mechanic to certify it. It might cost 2-300 for your mechanic to review. But save you thousands later."

Remember electricity follows the laws of physics. Find a wiring diagram for your car, and highlight every circuit that has current draw issues. From there, find the electrical components in the car that are shared between each of those circuits having problems. For example, if you have current draw on your hvac system and audio system, there’s likely an accessory relay that powers both of those that may have a problem.Just an example, but you wanna investigate all the components that all those circuits share. 

Also, every car has an actual specification for allowable current draw. 600ma seems high so I don’t doubt there’s still an issue, but some cars I’ve worked on, anything from 0-150ma is ok."

1osmgy2,Error codes on dashboard after oil change,"
I have a 2014 Nissan Altima. I don’t know my engine type but P is in the eighth position if that matters.

Yesterday, I got my oil changed and tires rotated, but as soon as I drove off, a bunch of error codes and lights came on my dashboard that were not on before the oil change. I immediately drove back and they just looked at me with a blank face and said there’s nothing that they did that could’ve caused that.

Today, in additional to all the errors and lights in the picture still being on, now my speedometer stays at 0 while driving and my gas gauge is continuously going from empty to full and back to empty. 

Any ideas about what’s going on and what could’ve caused this? 

Edit:
I forgot to include my picture of the errors and lights so I’ll list them here:
- I-Key System Error
- TPMS Error
- Engine light 
- Triangle with exclamation light 
- Tire pressure light 
- ABS light 
- Traction control light 
- Brake light

My current mechanic is trying to verify if the previous actually gave me a new catalytic converter by tracking the serial number. 

I’ve spent so much money on my car and honestly I should’ve sold it but I didn’t because this previous mechanic originally quoted me half the cost of repairs, said repairs shouldn’t take long, and ensured me that my car has more life in it.

I’m working on a research/automation project using a 2019 Mercedes CLA 220 and I’m trying to figure out how to remotely start and stop the engine via CAN bus control. This is for a controlled research environment (not for street use).
My Goal:

What I Have:
	•	2019 Mercedes CLA 220
	•	OBD-II adapter (basic one)
	•	Access to the OBD-II port

The car uses a CAN bus system (Controller Area Network) - basically the communication network where all the car’s computers talk to each other using just 2 wires (CAN-H and CAN-L on OBD-II pins 6 and 14).

1osylxs,2018 Ford Focus ground issue,"Trying to figure out if it's a bad ground, if so,  where to start looking for the ground fault. Or a BCM issue.

First part might be coincidence or might be part of the issue.  Last week I got a low tire pressure warning.  All the ties looked fine so I waited until I needed gas to check the pressure (2 days ago). 3 were between 33 and 35 psi, one was at 31 PSI. I topped them all up to 35. As soon as I pulled away, I noticed my right blinker hyper-flashed. I figured I blew a bulb, so when I got home,  I checked.  The indicator lights on the right side,  front and back, turned on but wouldn't fully turn off during the flash.  They looked more like they would lose a few volts between flashes. I had the next day off (today) to look at it.  

Last night, my wife walked by the window and noticed the blinker light was on.  Not flashing,  just on. I tried a few things to get it to turn off without success,  so I pulled the ground wire. 

Today,  I put the ground wire back on,  and the light stays on.  I use the turn indicator and it does the same fade a few degrees before flashing back on.  

I used my multimeter in a few places, with the engine running, to check ohms resistance, but I'm not sure where any of the ground points yet. The first place I checked, the small bolt that holds the engine compartment fuse box to the engine bay. Multimeter set at 200 ohms, black on ground jumping point, red on the fuse box bolt (they're right next to each other) and resistance read 114 to 115.5 range. A few bolts on the engine itself were in 19 to 20.8 range. With the engine off, the bolt holding the fuse box remains the same or higher.  But the engine bolts resistance goes down to around 1.5 ish

I initially was thinking of just using an aftermarket 2 pronged battery terminal and running the original cables to one prong and then my inverter to the other (fused ofc), but the dumb battery current sensor is adhered to the negative terminal clamp and I can't see any potential way I could attach it to a new clamp. The other two options I came up with was adding another wire screwed on to the nut on both the negative and positive terminals though I'm afraid the screws there might be too short and the nut might not be able to get tight enough; lastly I could try to build it into the cars current electrical wiring but I don't want to overload the wires running to the battery and I'd rather not mess around with the cars current fuse box if it can be avoided.

1osxghu,Parking brake drums stuck,"So, I royally messed up. Fixing the family 2016 FWD Sienna, the right rear parking brake wasn't holding. The adjuster was correct, rolling it a little more held the brake. Roll it a little back, the foot pedal only activated the left one. Frozen cable, I concluded. So, just to verify, I hauled on the cable manually a little at the split.

That turned out to be monumentally stupid.

The cable instantly unstuck. Whatever was sticking it wasn't much. What did happen was that both sides are now stuck on. I'm 90% sure I pulled hard enough to click the auto adjuster one notch too far on both sides. It's not rusted, as the reason I was back there in the first place was to do the the service brakes. The rotors and pads are brand new. (Though not the parking brake shoes.)

I've detached the parking brake cable. It now moves totally freely and has zero tension on it.

No big deal in most designs. Pop the rubber plug off the back and roll the adjuster loose. This isn't most designs. The plug is in the DRUM. It needs to be clocked straight down to adjust. Of course, neither side is.

First thought, just force it. Tried a pry bar between the lugs and twist. I could see the studs beginning to bend, no good. Ok, wheels back on and use the engine. Nope, just dragging the rears. I knew it was basically a zero chance, but pulled off the caliper bracket and tried to take the drum/rotor off. No way and it's all attached with springs, so no way to force it without major carnage.

Drill a new access hole is next. Two problems: first, there's a notch in the hub that the access hole lines up with. Drilling elsewhere would mean drilling the hub, too. And then there's the fact that both sides happen to be lined right up with a stud, so drilling would weaken the stud. No good. My last idea is to drill from the bottom, straight through the drum surface. Obviously, that would ruin the drum/rotor, but that's probably the cheapest thing to ruin, despite being brand new.

I’m having an issue with my Fiat Punto Evo 1.3 Multijet (2011).
As shown in the video, the temperature gauge sometimes drops slightly when the engine is idling — it doesn’t go all the way down to zero, but just lowers a bit.

However, when driving on the highway, the temperature gauge drops completely to zero, and then the check engine light comes on. After that, several systems get disabled, such as Start/Stop, ASR, ESP, and Hill Holder.

After a few hours, when I start the car again, everything works normally and the check engine light disappears.

I own a VW Touareg 2012 with a V6 engine. While the car generally runs great, I occasionally hear some noises that worry me. I have a few concerns and questions that I hope the Reddit community can help with, as my local mechanics often dismiss or only partially fix the issues.

1.	Steam from oil filter neck: When the engine is running, I notice steam/vapor coming out of the oil filter neck (see attached video at the end). Is this normal, or does it indicate an underlying problem?

2.	Moisture and creamy substance inside oil filter neck: I frequently find a thin, creamy, moisture-like substance inside the oil filter neck (see attached video). Should I be concerned? What might it indicate?

3.	Engine noise: I have recorded a video of the noise I hear sometimes. Does this sound normal for a V6 engine, or could it signify engine trouble?

4.	Tensioner bearing: I also noticed one of the tensioner bearings looks off in a video I took. Could this be a source of noise or damage, and should the bearing or the entire tensioner be replaced?

5.	Dipstick and digital oil level: I’m told the dipstick doesn’t exist in this model since it’s digitally monitored. However, I see a part that looks like a sealed dipstick. The digital oil level isn’t showing on my dashboard and prompts a message TO ADD MORE OIL 😱 even after refilling the exact oil quantity. I even replaced the electronic sensor, but no luck.

Could even modify an old scrap radiator cap to have an inlet to clamp the garden hose to & keep water going in & then out the bottom of radiator until it's clear water only. Where the bottom radiator hose connects to the block, have a quarter gap for some water to go onto the ground & the rest still goes through the engine 🤔

After that, then a rinse with distilled water (depending if the tap water there has much minerals in it) & then new coolant in.

I drove on the highway immediately afterwards and everything was fine, then the low oil pressure light popped up for about 2 seconds when I was braking after getting into town. I quickly pulled into a nearby parking lot. I checked the oil level (after wiping and redipping of course) and it was looking extremely high. I thought it might be misreading because I had just been driving, so I waited 10 minutes and then tried again. Still looked very high.

I noticed the mechanic wrote the filter type, oil type, and ""4.5L"" near the engine. The filter and oil type were correct, but the engine only takes 3.8L according to the manual. Overfilled, but I'm not sure if overfilled enough to read as high as it did (around 3 inches above the full line on the dipstick). I called the mechanic and the receptionist said she thought it was fine but would consult with the mechanic and let me know.

Home was only four blocks away so I drove it back. The low oil pressure indicator popped up again while braking on the way back, again for about 2 seconds before going away. I figured at that point that I better not drive again until I hear back.

I did not hear back from the mechanic, and they aren't open again until Monday. Should I siphon out excess oil myself or wait to hear back? Would 0.7L over the recommended amount be enough to read that way on the dipstick? Could being overfilled cause the low oil pressure indicator?

For context ive just purchased a 2022 Renault Trafic 2.0 Dci.
Van itself is in great shape and FSH, currently sitting at 125k miles which for Americans here is probably baby milage but that's a lot for a 3 year old van over here. Obviously it's motorway miles so it's not as hard on the engine as stop start city traffic. 

When googling I'm getting conflicting opinions on whether or not I should renew the chain as some say it will last the lifetime of the engine and others say to get it done at 100k miles as it's prone to stretching (though I'm assuming that's for the average 10k or so a year we do over here). There is no knocking or rattling noises at idle or on the gas so a little torn. 

Personally I'm leaning towards having it done for peace of mind as I intend to have this van for 5-6 years at least though would likely be in the new year as being a tradesman it's my busiest time of year with the Xmas rush.

1osum6c,Advise needed on the next steps,"Hey, folks. 2 years ago I've bought Mazda CX-30 2020 Skyactiv-X with just 19k miles on a dash. I own Mazda cars since 1998 and barely had issues with them.

This one was fine first year. On a second one - 27k mileage and I-stop stopped working. I connected OBD scanner - it showed P1200 error. So I checked official manual from Mazda - they advise Mazda deposit cleaner and high octane petrol for it- no problem - done in twice.  In general, I usually used Esso or Shell - with E5 and E10 petrol.

The error went away, but several months later - P0421 appeared: ""Warm up Catalyst efficiency below threshold Bank 1"". Check engine light is also on. No diff in how the car behaves - it works really good.

I tried then STP petrol cleaner and Cataclean after then - it didn't help.

So I took it to the dealer - they checked the car and said all looks really good including catalytic converter, but **the fuel trims are over the threshold (\~10%)**. They advised to remove injectors, clean them, update PCM. And quoted it with **1400 GBP.**

What I did then - asked to update the PCM block to the latest version and bought one more bottle of Mazda deposit cleaner from them to try again. They charged me **300 GBP**

I had 5 different Mazda cars with mileage up to 100k and never had such dumb issues.  
So the situation just baffles me...

Spend so much money for not an old card which was serviced and driven properly.. And now **1400 GBP** to clean the fuel injectors... Really?

Overall, I planned to sell this car next year.  
The car itself is almost in ideal condition with just 29k on the clock. The approx price for it to sell - will be **16.500 - 16.700 GBP.** But now with this check engine - I just don't know - they will gamble it 100%.

Not sure what to do next with it, to be fair. I thought if PCM and deposit cleaner don't help - try BG 44k PLATINUM. Maybe also quote some of specialised services that do injectors cleaning only... And then - I don't know...

Any ideas or thoughts?

But my old BMW’s now 16 years old and starting to show its age (More than a few issues now). Had it for about four years and racked up 60k miles doing the usual work stuff. I know next to nothing about electric or hybrid cars, so I’m pretty set on sticking with petrol. I’ve always bought used cars, some good, some not so great, but now with some new cars priced not much higher than used ones, I’m tempted. I’m not really fussed about monthly payments, could do without them, but the long warranties (5-7 years or 100,000 miles) are swaying me towards new just now.

Up until now, I was only looking at 5–10-year-old cars, usually family cars like the Kuga and VW, and well known manufactures to me. But tomorrow, I’m test driving four new model cars, all Chinese brands like Omoda, JAECOO, Chery, and BYD. Mainly because, well they’re cheap (between £22k-£32k) and seem to have all the tech I want (Android Auto, cameras, sensors etc). The engines are smaller but power looks decent, I don't need a race car (around 147bhp+). I did try some MGs new around the £23k mark, which were comfortable and had Android Auto, but the 1.5-litre engine felt a bit sluggish, even in non eco mode.

Normal dealerships have shown me the likes of the Renault Arkana Hybrid, hybrid Kugas, and a few others but nothing really comes close to these Chinese cars in terms of price or monthly costs. For example, the Omoda would be about £260 a month brand new (yeah, I know about the balloon payment or just handing it back if it’s a lease). I am between taking lease or PCP, I know new cars loose value, but I cant see it dipping so low, for example lets say i take the 3 years, the final payment will be about £10k if i want to keep the car, which TBH if i still like it seems like a really good option, Checking auto trader for SUV cars, which are automatic, with millage between 30-40k (my estimated millage), the cheapest seem to be coming in around 12k ish for a non categorized model. So to me even 3 years down the line, it will hold the value on the remaining price, this looks true also of some of the other cars as well, looking at MGs that were about 22k ish, buying one from 2023-2022, there all over 12k, a final PCP payment for those would also be under 10k.

From what I’ve seen, reviews are mostly positive. The only real issues seem quite rare like a batch with dodgy rear axles, and one review car that lost its steering wheel (but that wasn’t a final production model apparently). It’s tough to find much info about these cars in the UK though, just because they’re so new. See most places state the same issue with jittery steering over rougher roads, which ill be trying out tomorrow.

So, what do you all think? Would you consider any of these? Is there a Chinese brand you’d definitely avoid?

1osj5q4,Thinking of importing our car from Japan. How bad is the insurance really? 😅,"Hey everyone,

We’re expecting a baby next spring, so we’ve started looking for a car.

We were hoping to get something like a Toyota Auris or a Honda Civic here in the UK, but even 2014 models with around 50–60k miles seem to be close to £10k.

My parents live in Japan and have offered to give us their 2020 Honda Fit (same as the Jazz here) with about 35k miles on it.

We got a quote from a Japanese export company, and once you add up everything like shipping, import tax, registration and a few required modifications, it would come to around £7–8k in total.

It’s not massively cheaper than buying one here, but since it’s newer, has low mileage and we know it’s been well looked after, we’re quite tempted. Plus, my parents offered to cover all the import costs, so it’s even harder to say no!

The only thing we’re worried about is insurance. We’ve heard imported cars can be a lot more expensive to insure, and even though we’re in our 30s, we’ve never owned a car before. On top of that, my husband had a small accident with a rental car last year and ended up hitting someone’s car 😬

Since the car isn’t in the UK yet, we can’t get a proper quote. Does anyone know if insurance for imported cars is really that bad? Are we talking double the usual price, or just a bit more?😞Also, does it stay expensive forever, or is it just higher for the first few years?

I am considering buying a 2019 EX-Navi Honda Jazz with a quite high mileage (90k miles, link below). The MOT history looks pristine.

I intend to mostly drive it slowly around the city as I've just passed my license 👀 My partner has been driving for 10 years so occasionally we would pack our dog family and take it for some trips.

He test drove the car and saw nothing worrying, and checked that all basic fittings are working (based on chatgpt list...), however we have 0 experience with this model (he drove a toyota before).

The contents under the hood also don't look dirty or rusted... but again, we are not sure what too look for! (Attached some photos).

Questions that I have:
1) The dealer offers a 1 year warranty with a company called ""Warranty First"" for £500, but I've checked that they cover only up to £500 per claim? Which sounds weird. To go up to £1000 per claim the warranty cost would go to £690.
2) Is it possible to take this car to a garage before buying it? 
3) What might be some hidden issues that we should expect to see within the first 1-3 years for a car of this making, year and mileage?
4) What are some less obvious things that we should *absolutely* make sure of before buying this car?

Thank you so much in advance for any advice!!!

They either have claim value limits which mean they don't cover bigger repairs where a warranty would be needed in the first place, they have larger excesses which means you still fork out anyway or they have lots of exclusions which mean lots of faults aren't covered. 

As it's only 6 years old, I wouldn't expect much to go wrong. However you could either stick £50 a month into a pot to cover unexpected car costs, or contact a Honda dealer to see if you can buy a manufacturer's extended warranty. Personally I'd just go with the personal pot.

If you want peace of mind run a full HPI check, it's around £20 and will show you the car's full history. Including whether the car has been written off, stolen or reported scrapped. It will also show you if the car has any outstanding finance etc. 

Both the AA and RAC offer services where they will come and inspect a car for you, they usually start at £100 and go up to around £300 or so. I wouldn't say it's necessary, but if you wanted that extra peace of mind it's an available option.

90k miles isn't that high for a modern car, just make sure it has a full service history to show it's been looked after.

Are you financing the car or buying it outright? If you're paying for the car in full, pay £200 or so on a credit card. This will give you consumer protection under section 75 of the consumer credit act, where the credit card company will become jointly liable for the full value of the car should any issues arise and the dealer isn't helpful.

3. At that mileage you might be getting into wear of some components such as wheel bearings, cam belts (not sure if this is a belt engine however), suspension bushings. Basically anything that could be considered ""consumable""
4. You need a good check as to why there is such high mileage. For the type and age of car I would say that 90k is unusually high as they are small city cars driven by older sensible people in the main. However, buy on condition, not milage. 

For that price would it be worth considering something a little older but with a better history and lower miles? Don't get drawn in by the age of the car, newer isn't always better. You also need to factor in what it will be worth when you come to sell it, higher mileage cars like this will always be at the bottom end of the market and will likely loose you more than buying an older but lower mileage example. A good HPI check will give you a fair market value which you should be paying but for me I would look for an older Jazz/Yaris with average or lower mileage."

1oseaak,Secondhand market advice?,"hey pals - I'm just after a bit of advice if anyone has some! I have a 15 year old (2011) 1.25 ford fiesta which I've had for 11 years. we're at 96,500 and she's starting to give me a drop of grief. I don't drive as much as I used to now I mostly work from home, but my office is a 70 mile round trip which I do 5 times a month ish. I had her serviced in October and she was alright, but this week a spring in the gearbox gave out. I fear she's starting to deteriorate where it's going to cause me bother, and I don't fancy breaking down on the A1 in winter. It feels like it's 'time'. 

I LOVE this fiesta though so looking at new cars has been with relunctance, but more..the market is off it's chops?? I bought this fors with 11k miles on the clock for £5,000. I definitely can't find that now! 

Also - it turns out I'm mad fussy about how small compact cars feel now and how small windshields are?? I sat in loads yesterday and at 5'9, a lot of them made me feel like the jolly green giant. I also hate an ugly inside - I want something with a bit of character? i want a digital dash and decent interior and maybe ambient lighting (now I've seen it!). 

My budget is at most £16k but that's really not stretching far so I was just after some advice or ideas tbh. Ideally, I'm after no older than 2022 and no more than 25k on the clock because I want to keep it for another 10-15y. 

I had eyes on a yellow purrrrjot 208 or a mini cooper but hated both when i sat in them. I found the corsa, astra and mokka all too small window/visibility wise, and the same with the kia rio and ceed, and the hyundai i10. 

The ibiza, mazda m2, and MG m3 are on the ""its fine"" list, but i really want to love my next car and i just can't seem to find The One. my.pal had a bigger MG and hated the screen tech so I'm a bit dubious on that one, too.

I took out a renault clio espirit 1.0 but found it just had no oomph, and I also drove a 1.0 life golf and liked the feel but found my fiesta had more oomph behind it so im debating trying the bigger engine (but ££££). looked at a polo but i hate that the passenger windows are split with a column (i am OBSESSED with visibility). I'm  wondering if i should take out an ibizia (aware they're only 1 litre from i can see on autotrader?) and I'm also debating another fiesta but I've heard so many eco boost horror stories that I'm pretty nervous.

Is there any cars ive missed that you think I should consider - or anything? with the deranged market and the total lack of anything mid-range for £8k, i feel i only really want something higher end for the buck but....its a LOT? the market is properly off its chops.

Or I could possibly buy a much cheaper car older used car on finance and then sell it on in a month or so when I'm ready to buy, or possibly use it as a parts trade. (My credit isn't great, but I can get a finance deal- I'd just rather not).

1os8vhr,American looking to import project car to UK,"Hello, I'm on route to moving to the UK and i have a 1996 Acura Integra But i swapped it with a V6 from a 2003 Acura TL so I've gone from a 1.8L to a 3.2L. Here in Florida we don't have Inspections or MOT so what I'm most curious about is what is the likelihood of me actually being able to import and keep the car legal in the UK? I imagine that MOT emissions are tied to the car make/model and not engine displacement so if i swapped a bigger engine in they'll still expect factory emissions. Also the car is 90% ""stock"" otherwise, its not slammed to the ground, it has all safety equipment ect so my only concern really is passing emissions. Any info helps, Thank you.

An Acura tl is a luxury version of the Honda Accord in the UK, so it should meet safety standards although there may be some things that need changing such as headlights, tail lights, and reflectors etc to make it road legal.

When you register the car with the DVLA you will need to declare the engine swap which will set the tax rate that you have to pay. This will also dictate the emissions standard for the MOT, as the MOT uses the emissions limits for your car's tax band. When it comes to absolute limits, the limits for the year of whatever is older between the car and engine are used. So as long as that engine was ever compliant with UK emissions regs then it should pass the MOT once declared with the DVLA if it's healthy and has a catalytic converter fitted.

Your best bet would be to talk to a vehicle importer in the UK as they will know all this stuff in detail and can sort the paperwork out for you, at a cost of course!
