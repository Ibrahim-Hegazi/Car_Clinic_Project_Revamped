Any way to confirm this?  Is it safe to drive while I await a new one?  Can you advise a better source for this as this one seems to not have lasted like I thought. I bought the Dorman 926-959 from Amazon and used the gaskets so perhaps just the gaskets went bad?

1nzyjb1,Oil lamp indicator going crazy,"CONTEXT : 07 dodge caliber 119xxx miles
Rebuilt title, owned since 2019 (bought rebuilt)

About a month ago driving home from work (30 miles 1 way) when I got off the highway and stopped at a red, the oil lamp came on. Once I accelerated it went away and that repeated till I was home.

Didn‚Äôt drive it for about 2-3 weeks while I did all I could think to see what caused this, oil change, checked the oil level before the change (last change was about 1.5k miles ago from when this started happening) and then once I did all that I let the car idle a while, everything was fine. Didn‚Äôt drive it to work but did local driving to test how it was holding up and no issues for about a week. Oil level was staying consistent, the heat level wasn‚Äôt higher than usual, the light didn‚Äôt come back on for about 2 weeks of doing this local driving (about 2-4 days of maybe 5-10 miles of driving every week or so) 

Got in a position where I needed to take it to work as I had no other vehicle, the first day it was fine, no light BUT it did show up on my way home (same situation with red light) and I checked levels they were slightly lower than should of been. I topped it off with some oil and hoped for the best.

Next day I drive it to work and back and on my way back from work I took more locals roads in fear of high speeds via highway being to dangerous to test my luck. Now I‚Äôm stuck with this Spamming of the light.

FURTHER CONTEXT. Car drives, sounds, everything about it is 100% normal nothing is new, cars runs the same, oil temp is not increasing from usual levels, but with it being a CVT I am noticing some fierce moments of the car feeling like it‚Äôs what I can only explain as losing power without the power going off. It‚Äôs jolting at slower speeds as if it‚Äôs slipping gears but is a CVT. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs at it end of life being a nearly 20 yr old dodge with a rebuilt title but just curious if this is simple or expensive to diagnose.

Called a battery booster service, played with the fuse box and checked the fuses to see, all good there according to my insignificant knowledge. 

Guy comes, uses a battery booster pack (like from any CT or other store) and turn the key, light click and a long buzz. 
Nothing for a few minutes, he hooks his Jeep up (pre wired for boosting) and same story.  
Then he adds the battery booster as well and about half a minute wait with both on and she runs!

1nzx02n,Trying to diagnose my A/C system not working,"So my A/C is blowing hot air, and I'm trying to figure out what could be going on before I do any work on it or even seek professional help. First initial thought. It needs refrigerant. Haven't bought the bottle yet, but in the meantime seeing if I can come to any other conclusion just in case. What I noticed when I looked at my car.   
A/C compressor clutch isn't spinning.  
A/C cold/low side is full of pressure that isn't refrigerant, and is just air.  
When the car is on, and I try to relieve the pressure since it's full of air, and not refrigerant now. It lowers a bit, but goes back up.   
Whole system was replaced and cleaned out 2 years ago, because of blockages.   
The Compressor, Condenser, and Expansion valve are 2 years old.  
Only r134a refrigerant, and any oil or pre oil that was already in the parts are the only things in the line.   
  
Any advice on what could be going on? I'm new to fixing my car's A/C and would definitely like to learn.

History: 2 years ago, started having intermittent engine shutdown while in operation. Started once every 2 months, slowly evolved into twice a week. Seemed to happen most frequently when I'd hit a bump or pothole. A couple cranks and it usually started right back up. Sometimes while still in motion.

Trouble shooting: No dash lights. No codes from OBD. C/NS in Park and neutral. Air/spark good. No fuel pressure at rail. No sound from fuel pump when key in on position. Checked fuses, relays, and inertia switch, all good. At the plug to the fuel pump, yellow wire - 8.6v, black/red stripe 3.2v, solid black 0v, red/black stripe 0v.

Pretty common leak. Easy enough to repair if your parking brake works, sometimes it is difficult to unbolt the nut that holds the pinion flange on without that, unless you have a second person that can hit the brakes while you break that nut loose. Working alone, trying to break that nut loose you end up just turning the input to the rear axle on moving the whole vehicle.

Also, when you disconnect your rear driveshaft, keep in mind the vehicle is now free to roll wherever it wants unless you put it in four-wheel-drive First, so block the wheels or figure that out .

1nztki5,Confused about car coolant consumption,"**prefacing this post by admitting I know very little about cars and even less about what happens under the hood of a car so bear with me here**

Year: 2009

Make: Mazda

Model: 2

Engine: 1.3 L

Last Friday I bought this Mazda 2 from a guy who had owned it for several years. The car has been maintained well by its previous owner  (as far as I can tell from the maintenance histoy) and he said he got rid of it as he bought himself a Tesla, but I am noticing something peculiar about the coolant consumption. When I purchased the car, I drove home (took me around 45 minutes / 50 km drive). A couple hours later I checked the fluids and noticed the car was low on coolant, so I picked up 1L of coolant at the local BP and filled it back up to around full again. I took it for a couple of short drives (like 10 minutes), and the coolant would still be full the next day. However, this morning I took it on a somewhat longer drive of around 60km (45 minute journey), and when I checked the coolant before I drove back home (around 9 hours after driving to work), around half of the coolant had dissipated, only being at around the ""low"" mark now. I've read that this could be caused by a blown head gasket, a faulty water pump or a leaky radiator, but the first one seems unlikely since my fuel usage is good, I don't have any strong or weird smells whilst driving and there isn't any smoking coming out of my exhaust. I checked my coolant 1 hour after arriving back home from work, and it was still at around the same level that it was when I left work. I checked it again just now, which was around 4 hours after I arrived back home, and the coolant still seemed to be at the same level (perhaps slightly lower than when I checked it 1 hour afterwards). 

I know this is a mouthful but does anyone know what I could be dealing with? A hose directly under my coolant reservoir seems to be slightly damaged so perhaps it is just that, but it didn't seem to be leaking or wet when I checked it. It has also been hard to check the surface for wet spots because it has been raining all day every dayüòÖ. Does anyone know what I am most likely dealing with?

Wondering if it‚Äôs a wiring issue? Guidance on how to diagnose this? Or should I just change the bulbs and see where that leads me? 
To add, when I first got it I threw a couple engine codes (PO455), and in my history was (CO306) and (CO321). I immediately called my dealer because it also had a couple other issues, such as my automatic windows stopped working and we‚Äôre going really slowly. And my bottom tail light stopped working as well.
Something was also making a creaking noise on my right drivers side (I suspect a suspension issue but all my boots look good, I‚Äôm going to go ahead and just put new shocks/struts in and new ball joints this coming weekend to see how it does). 
Long story short I took it back to the dealer, they said they fixed the Evap leak code but didn‚Äôt hear the creaking noise. Granted  
I didn‚Äôt either because it was raining for a couple days at the time so it did stop the sound until it got dry out again. 
Picked my truck back up, come to find out they most certainly did not fix the evaporator code because my engine light popped up again for the same thing.

1nzrs0m,Jerking while driving,"2006 Chevy Malibu LT, 2.2L 160,100 miles on it.

Apologies if there is any unnecessary info, I'm not sure what all is relevant to this problem so I want to provide everything I can.

Been an issue for a while, thought it may have been bad spark plugs but those have been replaced. 
Usually seems to happen while going 45mph and over for a while, maybe 10 minutes of driving. I noticed it most while using cruise control going 65-70 on the highway. It doesn't feel like a shift, the jerk is much more harsh (it's hurt my neck a couple times, for an example of the harshness) and the RPM jumps up ever so slightly, but it doesn't rev at all. (Slow shifting has been an issue as well, RPM goes up to 5-6k going between 2nd-3rd and 3rd-4th. Not sure if this issue is related). Again, unsure if this is relevant, but the temp goes up while idling (not overheating), and down while driving. (170+ idle, under 150 after driving for 2 minutes, went back up to 172 at a red light).
AC compressor is blown, blower motors don't move, and blend door actuator is likely faulty. 

I do have code P0442, cleared it once and it came back 4 days later. 
I also know there may be some transmission damage from a transmission fluid leak that was caught too late, the car was driven for ~5 months with the leakage.
Fluid lines have been replaced, fixed in Jan. 
I regularly check all fluid levels, and the oil was changed 2 weeks ago.

What could be the cause of this jerking? 


ETA: I got to check more after I got off work, a little more added: OBD reader is saying my spark advantage is fluctuating between -1.5 and 5.0 while idling. MAF is .42lb/min.

Block tests with the color changing fluid typically only work if the leak is larger. 80K miles isn't a high mileage but head gaskets are one of the most common reasons we see coolant levels drop with no apparent reason.

Immediately after the repair, some new noises began to appear. When going over bumps, I would hear a violent clunk. In addition, the noise shown in the video above started happening whenever I turned the steering wheel while stopped or at low speeds.

Next, we replaced the sway bar links and sway bar bracket bushings, since it sounded like the sway bar was moving excessively. That fixed the violent clunking over bumps, but this noise remained. Once the loud sway bar issue was gone, it became clear that this sound wasn‚Äôt limited to being generated by steering input. It too occurred when driving over bumps. I just couldn‚Äôt hear it over the sway bar before. This noise sounds exactly the same whether turning the steering wheel or going over a bump. It‚Äôs the same thing, coming from the same area (driver‚Äôs side). Hitting a bump on either side of the car will generate this noise, though the sound always physically emits from the driver‚Äôs side no matter what. 

It was then suggested that the tie rods or tie rod ends might be worn, so we replaced both. This **significantly** reduced the noise when going over bumps, but it didn‚Äôt eliminate it completely. It also didn‚Äôt affect the volume while turning the steering wheel.

1. Have a large opening in the lens, so called f-number, which lets more light in. The larger the opening the shallower the focus depth is however, so you can't really use a super large opening in stuff like dashcams.

2. Have a long shutter speed, which in videocameras is called a shutter angle. But the longer it is the more motion blur there is which makes it harder to see details, such as licence plate numbers.

3. Have a large ISO number, which refers to the sensitivity of the sensor (or film). This is what the dashcam is most likely relying on. The larger the sensitivity is the more grain and noise there is. Better quality sensors perform better with larger ISO numbers, but you'll only find those in more pro cameras, really.

I start with polishing compound with a pad on a drill. This usually gets at least half the headlight clear. Then I work down starting at 1500 until the ""fog"" is gone. Only in the areas needed. I've never had to go deeper than 800. Work back up to 1500 and then polishing compound. This is the fastest way I have found.

If its known to you that its the original motor and intake, the firing order is stamped on the intake. But thats fooled me many times.

If not, take off your valve covers and rotate it through a full go, keeping track of the valve opening order, that can tell. It was also common to put a cam in them and have it change the firing order. 15426378 or 13726548. So.. if #3 opens after #1, you have the newer style, if its #5, its the old style. New style has better harmonics and less front main wear since there isn't a twinned pair in the front. If you ever buy a cam it will almost always be the newer style. If so, grind off the intake firing order and dremel/stamp on the correct one.

Also.. add a pcv valve. Both sides. It'll leak a fuckton less.

1nzpy7h,Frame damage is way more serious than most people realize,"Seeing a lot of posts here where people are asking if frame damage is a big deal or if they should buy a car that's had frame damage repaired. Thought it might help to explain what this actually means and why it matters.

First thing to understand is that frame damage means the impact was hard enough to bend or deform the structural metal that holds the car's shape. This isn't like a dented door. The whole geometry of the car gets thrown off. Even small frame damage causes major issues because everything on a car is designed to super precise measurements.

Frame damage affects literally everything about how the car functions. Suspension can't work properly. Alignment will be off no matter how many times it gets adjusted. Tires wear unevenly. The car might pull to one side. Doors might not close right. Steering feel might be off. In front end collisions with frame damage, engine and transmission mounts might not line up anymore which causes vibrations.

But the biggest issue is safety. The frame is designed to crumple in specific ways during an accident to protect occupants. If that structure has been damaged and repaired, there's no guarantee it will perform the same way in another crash. Even if it's been straightened back to correct measurements, the metal has been stressed and weakened. It's been bent and then bent back, and metal doesn't love that.

Repairing frame damage is possible and happens all the time. Shops use frame machines that can pull bent metal back into place with laser measuring systems to check against factory specs. If done properly, measurements can be made right again. But here's the thing, even if measurements are perfect, that metal has still been compromised. The structural integrity isn't the same as a car that's never been damaged.

When looking at buying a used car with repaired frame damage, that's a huge risk. There's no way to know how good the repair was without professional inspection. Even if the repair was perfect, the car's value is permanently reduced. Insurance companies factor in previous frame damage and payouts will be lower. Trying to resell a car with frame damage history is difficult because buyers are rightfully wary.

Sometimes frame damage is minor like a slightly bent front rail that got properly straightened. But often sellers say damage is ""minor"" when it really wasn't. The only way to know is getting repair records or paying for independent inspection.

Modern cars have crumple zones, reinforced pillars, and engineering that determines exactly how the structure should behave in a crash. Frame damage throws all that out the window. Airbag sensors might not work the same way. Crumple zones might not crumple correctly. It's impossible to know without crash testing that specific repaired car.

Frame damage is one of those things that sounds fixable and sometimes the car can look and even drive normally, but the underlying compromise is permanent. It's not like cosmetic damage. This is why vehicles with frame damage history are flagged on Carfax and why resale value drops so much.

For anyone considering buying a car with frame damage history, really think hard unless it's significantly cheaper and just going to be a beater. Even then, safety should be considered. There are plenty of used cars without frame damage history. The discount usually isn't worth the risk.

Always get a pre purchase inspection and run a vehicle history report before buying any used car. Frame damage is one of those things that absolutely needs to be known about before money changes hands.",19,1759772706.0,11,autorepair,1759865577,2025-10-06 17:45:06,2025-10-07 19:32:57,"darealmvp1 (Score: 6): Problem lies that sellers aren't required do disclose such damage.

robotNumberOne (Score: 2): I have mixed feelings on this one, because on the one hand I do think that vehicles that have had frame damage do require additional scrutiny and there are a lot of people out there doing sketchy structural repairs. On the other hand there are people out there who think any time structure needs to be repaired it's the end of the world.

If all excessively deformed parts are properly replaced per OE specifications and the frame puller is used as it was intended to correctly align the frame for repair, I would have no concerns with the driveability or safety of a vehicle like that.

Some people seem to think that it's impossible to repair structural damage on a vehicle and still have a vehicle that is as safe as it was when it left the factory, which simply isn't true.

Some other people think if it looks okay and drives okay, it's just as good as it was, which also isn't true.

Structural damage is properly repaired at body shops every day, and shitty repairs are also happening every day."

 First, i take the old pads out and theres no hardware. The little polished pieces of stainless that the pads slide on. Now I go to install new pads and they dont fit...

1nzfsk1,Is it possible for my car (silver) to cause this damage (blue) or are they trying to insurance scam me?,"
They were in front of me at a red light. Our bumpers barely tapped. We pull over and my first instinct is to ask if he‚Äôs okay to be polite, but he immediately points out the damage and starts telling me it‚Äôll cost $2000-$3000 to fix. 

It‚Äôs my first time being in an accident despite driving for over a decade so I‚Äôm frazzled. I want to de-escalate so I say no problem if I‚Äôm at fault then I have no issue paying for it. 

Then I realize my car has not even a scratch on it or any blue paint transfer from his car. The damage is on the side of his bumper even though I was directly behind him and wouldn‚Äôt have clipped him on an angle like that. It also looks like a long scrape not a bump?

I ask if he minds if I take some photos and his entire demeanour suddenly changes. He says ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably nothing, I am very late so I have to go. It‚Äôs probably okay. I will call you tomorrow with the damage details.‚Äù And tries to leave immediately. I insist on taking photos and he keeps repeating he has to go and he‚Äôll tell me the damage tomorrow. 

Now I‚Äôm suspicious so I shine a light on my car and ask him where he thinks the cars connected because there‚Äôs not even a hair of a mark on mine. He doesn‚Äôt answer and just repeats ‚Äúit‚Äôs probably nothing. I‚Äôll let you know tomorrow‚Äù and leaves without taking any photos of anything himself. 

He also took forever to come out of the car when we pulled over so he wasn‚Äôt in a rush to begin with. It was also a Sunday night. I was wearing a baby pink sweatshirt and look very young so perhaps he thinks I‚Äôm naive?

If the level is right where it needs to be, well I'd begin expecting the worst and hoping for the best because that would mean there's likely a crack somewhere in your transmission's valve body.

1nzwfj8,P0107 Likely Causes?,"2013 Toyota Prius, 1.8 L Engine

I am getting a code from my scanner of a p0107 code for MAP Censor Circuit and needing some help on next steps. Google can only get me so far and I‚Äôm hoping some advice may help. 

This is after a head gasket replacement. The engine seems to run fine, but I haven‚Äôt gone for a test drive yet for being nervous about the engine stalling because of poor readings from the map sensor. Below is what I‚Äôve done so far and what I‚Äôve found, I‚Äôd be curious about what your next steps would be after reading the below. 

The connector and wires does not seem to be corroded or broken in any way

I‚Äôve checked the ground wires and they all seem tight (although I‚Äôm reading the ground for the MAP is not connected to the engine and the three ground wires I‚Äôve checked all bolt to to the valve cover and one from the valve cover to the chassis, I haven‚Äôt removed any other wires other than the ones connected to the engine directly) 

I did have to tighten two of the ground wires that go from the harness to the valve cover, that made ignition coil circuit codes go away but not the MAP sensor code. 

I haven‚Äôt tried cleaning the sensor, but I can‚Äôt imagine that would be an issue if it wasn‚Äôt before. 

I haven‚Äôt checked fuses, nor have I checked anything with a multi meter yet.

With a circuit code, is it more likely to be the sensor itself or a fuse? Or somehow a ground wire I didn‚Äôt even touch? Is it possibly a vacuum leak if I damaged a hose while removing them?

All that to be said this MAP sensor was not a code at all before I changed the head gasket, and just came up when I started the car for the first time after the repair along with the ignition coil circuit codes that fixed by tightening ground wires. 

I find it hard to believe something just went bad on the sensor or electronically all of the sudden, but electronics are all still pretty new to me. 

Thanks for any help!

I got an oil change & tire rotation on August 15. They also installed new shocks - one of which was defective - and they heard the rattling, but ‚Äúsince there was no note of a rattle when I brought it in,‚Äù they weren‚Äôt sure if the rattle was from the new shocks or not, so they didn‚Äôt mention it to me. They waited until I drove away, heard it, & immediately came back & had to give them my car for another full day to fix the defective shock. Needless to say, there wasn‚Äôt a rattle noted when it came in because there was no rattle happening. So I was already kind of annoyed with them at this point, but it got fixed, I moved on. 

Fast forward 5 weeks & 1,000 miles, there is a really loud clanking in the front end of my vehicle. I was on the highway when it sounded like I was in an airplane. My car had a recall on the engine a few years ago that affected me & ever since then, I‚Äôm very apprehensive to drive when my car is making any abnormal noise. So I got home & didn‚Äôt drive. My cousin is a mechanic & he came by to check it out. 

Well, the front driver side tire was severely wobbly because the lug nuts weren‚Äôt tightened down. He gets them hand tight for me & the noise is gone. Obviously, they didn‚Äôt tighten the bolts down fully when I had been in for my rotation so I get my car in ASAP, let them know what happened. Blah blah apologetic. I tell them I want them to make sure my car is in alignment & balanced as I just put new tires on in April, so I‚Äôm obviously concerned about uneven tread. 

Car is way out of balance, okay. Car is way out of alignment, figures. The exact wording from the inspection: 
- there is play in the left front lower ball joint very minor pts. 
- There is very slight play in the left front outter tie rod pts. 
- We recommend doing the outter tie rods/lower ball joints in pairs. 

The left front tire is the tire that was not secured. The manager claims that the tie rod isnt their fault. so we can fix it for you, but it‚Äôs not associated with the car being driven while it had a wobbly tire. Mind you, i had probably driven 30 miles total, before finding out the problem was the unsecured tire. Not a ton of miles, but not nothing. Not to mention I was on the highway & my tire could have come off & killed me. 

The guy tells me ‚Äúokay well your car is ready for pickup, we won‚Äôt align it or do any further work on it then if you‚Äôre disputing the source of the problem. The corporate office will be in touch about how to proceed with this since you think this is related to the tire being unsecured. If the tire had completely come off while driving, I would agree with you. But since you‚Äôve never had your car aligned here, I don‚Äôt know how long it‚Äôs been out of alignment.‚Äù 

Point of fact: they most recently checked my alignment in April 2025 when they gave me 4 new tires, with everything coming out ok. Wouldn‚Äôt they have noticed the tie rods being messed up then? So yeah, never been aligned because I hadn‚Äôt needed it. I have the report still. And if the tire had come off you‚Äôd say it was related?! At which point the car would have crashed & I may or may not be around to even care about the wobbly tire. The tire rod would have been the least of my concerns at that point. 

So, since I‚Äôm not a mechanic, and I am a female, I feel like the dude thinks I‚Äôm dumb. But I‚Äôm just trying to understand how this ISNT related as he so claims? If it‚Äôs not related, I really would like to know & I‚Äôll happily eat my words.",1,1759793147.0,7,AskMechanics,1759865577,2025-10-06 23:25:47,2025-10-07 19:32:57,"Jkoochie (Score: 2): Thank you all for your explanation!

DarienKane (Score: 1): The tie rods. ""Tie"" the steer tires together, think of them like an adjustable stick that holds both tires in unison so they always point the same way. The adjustment on them is to keep the tires aligned with each other. Now a wobbling tire can exert force and cause premature wear on the tie rods, but I'd say 30 miles isn't near enough, however 5 months is plenty of time for a part that seems fine (who knows how many miles it has on it) to now need replacing. It might not have been bad before, but a little age and a little extra force could have worn it out. It's hard to say. Maybe get a second opinion. Or just start going to a shop that remembers lugnut day from thier training. Ron White has a pretty good joke ( really happened) about it."

Having bad tread on top of that worries me, as I drive ~3 hrs daily for work about 5 days a month. Would you recommend only replacing the rear two or all four? My front tires are in worse condition due to the control arms. I'm leaning toward just replacing all four. 

EDIT: Thanks everyone for your responses. I'm going to take it to a local shop this week. They also work with used tires, but if I can't get any used, I'll just replace them. I want to save money until I replace the car, but I also want to get home in one piece. You all helped me think about the situation more seriously.

Belt only connected to 2 devices now being alternator and crank pulley. To save time and money i just left the ac compressor in there. Never had any alternator issues before today.

Started the the car, and noticed a small amount of smoke coming from the alternator area. 

I shut off the car, and inspected the belt which was still room temperature. I sprayed a little bit of belt conditioner on the belt and started again, still had a little smoke coming from it but the belt stayed cold.

Upon inspection, I didn't install the belt tight enough. I broke my 10mm socket on the tensioner so im wrenching at it for now and it might take a little while haha. Hopefully i can just undo the lock bolts and have an easier time adding tension and then once it's at proper tension the smoking will stop.",1,1759782745.0,4,AskMechanics,1759865577,2025-10-06 20:32:25,2025-10-07 19:32:57,"Original_Bicycle5696 (Score: 2): Since you did the A/C bypass and re-routed the belt, did you check to make sure the belt is running the same direction?

1nzuc09,Power Steering Nightmare,"Around 6 months ago, I was experiencing a bad leak coming from part of the return line (power steering) in my 02 camry. A shop took care of it, and the noises disappeared and fluid stayed at a constant level for 6 months. I paid $642 at the time (rip). 


Driving home from work the other night, I noticed a loud whining coming from the right hand side of my car. Turns out, almost all of my power steering fluid was gone again and the pump was not having it. I topped it off and bled the system. 

I brought the car back to the same shop that did the power steering job. On my receipt, it just says ""two return line hoses + power steering pressure line assembly"". They currently cannot look at the car for another 10 days. 


In the pictures, you'll notice the frame is pretty wet. The line that is circled in blue I believe is part of the high pressure system or 44410-06080 Toyota part #. The boots on the rack look okay but the body of the rack is pretty wet. 

What's also weird is that the area around the power steering pump appears slick with fluid, but all of the leaking is visibly coming from the right hand side of the car. 


There is a noticeable slow drip coming from the places circled in blue. I fear it may be the steering rack going bye bye since the leaking is on the right only, I'm sure the seal could be going bad where the tie rod goes in. But there is also leaking all over the metallic parts of the high pressure lines.

I have a little booster pack but wasn't able to jump it with that, even after cleaning off the terminals with a stiff brush. I called CAA and it eventually started after they jumped it. I drove for an hour on the highway after that, so the battery should have been fully charged. 

The next day it wouldn't start again so I figured the 3-year old battery was probably due to be replaced. I bought a new one but the car still wouldn't start after installing the new battery, so I had CAA tow it to a nearby garage. They tested the charging system (alternator, starter and battery) and said that my terminals just needed a good cleaning. 

I took the car on a camping trip this past weekend and it started up fine every time, even after sitting for two days. I did notice on the way back that the engine sounded a little louder than usual, and when we stopped for food after an hour of highway driving, it wouldn't crank on the warm start. Tried to boost it with the booster pack, no luck even after leaving it connected for 10 minutes. We also tried tapping the starter while I turned the key, no luck. After around 30 minutes of waiting for CAA, my partner tried one more time and the car started right up. Same thing once we got home and I parked it - the car wouldn't start again warm, but when I tried the next day, it started up fine.

So the battery charges when the car is running if the alternator is working properly. If your alternator is working fine and the battery is still not charging, then that battery is simply cooked and needs to be replaced. 

Have you tried jumping the car and seeing if it starts? If you jump it and it starts, keep it running for 45 mins to an hour in a well ventilated area (preferably outside). If the battery is still dead after that then your alternator is busted and needs to be replaced. If jumping doesn‚Äôt work to get it started, then the battery is probably busted.

1nzntzg,Help with flickering lights,"So backstory:

i bought this audi a5 sportback from a guy who gets his cars shipped in from Denmark
He didnt know much history about it but the makn concern now are these flickering lights

According to him the lights are an intentional modification due to the new wires (i have photos seplarately but i cant upload vid AND pics so yeah) and that i just need to add the old wires back so everything works out fine

So now the different opinions from different people:

1 - the dude himself and one mechanic believes that changing the wires will solve the issue because its an intentional mod
2 - a person at an autoparts store thinks it might be a bad contact or wrong voltage somewhere
3 - two dudes at an autoshop checked the battery and the voltage is correct and they think it might be some kind of circuit block things (idk the name) responsible for the xenon and led parts sepparately 
4 - another option is that the general light control thing was in a flood or something (but only the front headlights flicker)

sidenotes: this car seems to have headlight cleaning spray things but they dont work. Also the lights work normal for like 10 seconds when starting the car (and work fully normal when the engine is off).

nothing unusual pops up on the lil computer they hook up to the car as well

one mechanic suspects its a mod and might be programmable so if all else fails im going to his friend next week to figure this out

He is quoting me around $300 to replace all the spark plugs. he also said my ignition coils have a ""very weak spark"" and is recommending I replace all of those (quoted around $800) total for those.

3 month into ownership the headgasket blown, replace but did not skim the head due to time constraint as well as the car was not overheating. 

2 month later 2nd headgasket blown again, this time I did it proper, send to machine shop for resurfacing, grind the valve and change all the seal. Ive notice while taking the engine apart, the thermostat was missing, my theory is that the engine has overheated in the past?

Example- on door line we had around 8 harnesses (late 90's-early 2000s) depending on what options were on each car. There were some with & without tweeters, some with & without alarms, at the time we had one for manual crank windows, electric mirrors with or without heat. When I delivered parts, there were something like 15-20 engine main harnesses that clip in around the firewall before the engine is installed. 

I doubt that one wire harness is going to fix your problem, I would want to do some intensive research on it first. Also, I may be wrong about the Matrix so do some research before you take my word for it.

Audi S4 / S6 avant - fairly dull but quick and nice interiors. Reliability is good and build quality up there with best in my experience. Non S versions can be reasonably quick with the 2.0tsi and a good amount cheaper.



Jag XF-S - great to drive and looks sleek, but you're playing reliability Russian roulette. If I knew for a fact it would be reliable then this would be my choice.



Skoda Superb - enormous, comfortable, reliable, great build quality and quick versions available, but about as fun to drive as it looks



Merc E class - interiors on the later versions are plush, plenty of quicker versions, comfortable and the diesels have a good reputation for reliability, but big, heavy, and expensive.

shoopaaa (Score: 2): Well, it depends. I personally would recommend you go for something with 3 full sized rear seats. Firstly, when you have car seats in, the middle seat tends to end up be take up partly by them, meaning a person would struggle to be in the middle. Secondly, depending on the seats you have, there likely isn't isofix in the centre.

Cars that have a full-size middle seat tend to be SUVs and MPVs. Think VW Touran, Ford S-Max and any van based MPV or Volvo XC90, Audi Q7 and Peugeot 5008. Think a Tesla Model X has 3 full rear seats as well.

Changing to a more practical family lugger for the main car when they're little is an absolute lifesaver. Yeah, it's not always the most fun thing, but choose carefully, test drive well, and you'll still end up with something you enjoy driving.

1nzvwzj,"First four years of MOT history missing, known plate change - need help","So we are beginners looking at buying a used car, 2013 hybrid Yaris.

This looks mostly very good, one owner, low milage, serviced every 12 months by Toyota even when not driven much, and within budget.

Questions needing help with:
- the first four years of MOT are missing up to October 2017, and when running a HPI check, this seems to track with a plate change in 2016 which the dealer noted. But searching the other plate number returns as invalid on gov.uk and other sites. Any possible explanations or is this suspicious? Would asking the dealer for the VIN number help?
- the windshield has a small chip on the passenger side less than 10mm which I understand isn't an MOT fail, however it's also never appeared as an MOT Advisory in the history either. Is that normal or a potential problem?

Overview - 
A 2004 model will be a ‚Äúblobeye‚Äù , the cars got an ej205 and it‚Äôll be mated to a 5 speed. In standard trim this is quite reliable and fine to work on . 2.5k examples should be avoided . The actual chassis (GDA and GDB) is generally referred to as the ‚Äònew age‚Äô chasssis. The wrxs spanning 2001-2007 are fundamentally the same car with different bumpers 

Servicing- 
The cambelt, water pump etc are all much easier than normal being on the front of the engine, the clutch can be upsetting but only because the gearbox is heavy . Spark plugs aren‚Äôt problematic like people make them out to be and generally just look at things like keeping it well libricated and fluids fresh . The EJ engine CANNOT run on 95 octane fuel, I had to use it once in emergency and it was an unhappy bunny. They can but I‚Äôd highly advised against it, the general design of it makes it way more prone to knock and ping . Being a Subaru it‚Äôs a given the cars had a hard life already. Look for the heat shields and make sure they‚Äôre there. There should be a large one on the exhaust manifold and on the turbo, removal suggests the items have been off. Look for good history and listen for all your usual stuff . Especially listen for a whine in either 2/4 or 1/3 , the 5 speed is fine but mistreated is known to fail. The brakes (282mm setup) are a little bit under specced for serious driving. Thankfully this makes it very obvious if the cars been ragged because the discs will turn a lovely dark blue colour . Make sure all the calipers match. Rear handbrakes can be loose but easy to adjust . Make sure the car isn‚Äôt fitted with a BOV, the Subaru is very sensitive to this and will run horribly rich with one installed. Outside that just make sure to check it over properly and remember 

Common issues (engine) 

Oil burning out the engine bay when hot/stationsry? This WILL be the cam cover seals, the seals (especially the turbo side) shrivel and allow oil to drop straight on the manifold 
Oil burning on startup? Almost certainly  failing turbo, the original td04 has had a hard life and will need replacing . They‚Äôre not known for headgaskets so just ignore that joke entirely 
Mysterious ticking? It‚Äôs seemingly common for people to time the engine a tooth out on either bank, doesn‚Äôt cause any issue really but it does loose you power and cause a weird tick as a teeny bit of air escapes on the compression stroke . 
Oil leaking out the bottom of the cambelt covers? The camshaft seals do fail eventually and they are a pain . All the seals are an easy job . A weekends worth of servicing will make one reliable and everything‚Äôs genuinely easier than it‚Äôs made out to be 

All your suspension stuff is very obvious, they‚Äôll need bushings by now but it‚Äôs all very easy to do , make sure you take note of where the front camber bolts where lined up to. 

ROT, oh the joys 
Newage especially suffers from rear turret rot, this is by far the most condemning and most severe area for rust. Reach way up into the top of the rear turrets where they bolt to the car, rotate your hands inwards towards your face and squeeze. If it‚Äôs anything other than perfectly firm? Run. There‚Äôs videos and photos of this online . CHECK FOR IT. It‚Äôs a rear quater off job to fix it and it‚Äôs multi thousands to have sorted. Sills go under the skirts and generally the rear end scabs up. On the front of the car the subframe rusts as well as the radiator support but nothing to horrible 

Outside that just check for a good service history and any concerns please ask . They‚Äôre really good cars but it‚Äôs a very good case of ‚Äúit‚Äôll cost the same but would you rather buy a nice one and spend nothing or a rotter and it break the bank‚Äù type car . Avoid anything that‚Äôs been splattered with tat and there are PLENTY. I‚Äôd go as far as looking for bog standard ones to be honest. As silly as it sounds the blue ones are almost always the worst condition. Something about the colour attracts ‚Äúthat type of owner‚Äù"

The correct answer is to take it to a specialist and have it fixed properly and then keep or sell it - but a lot of garages won't touch those engines so you'll need to look around/get recommendations - don't choose the cheapest either.

I'm guessing the original problem was DPF cracking (or at least they assumed that) - it was a problem on the earliest Ingeniums so that makes sense but...

Your later issues are more likely caused by something else setting codes which prevents DPF regeneration which means your DPF will fill/require cleaning and you'll get the ""countdown"" after which it won't even start - what sort of mileage has this done?

Everytime I turn the wheel slightly stationary or driving, the car makes a loud creaking/grinding noise in the right (drivers) side of the car, between the wheel and that side of the engine, also when gears are changed that same noise occurs but no transmission issue 

Also when driving the wheel and car simultaneously turn quite a bit to the left, no idea if this is a related issue or not, but you can‚Äôt let go of the wheel otherwise 3 seconds later you‚Äôll nearly be 90 degrees to the left, it‚Äôs had an alignment done so that‚Äôs not the issue

The gear change issue might be just due to weight transfer causing the noise. The ends of the front spring/springs might be moving against the top mount/and or base of the strut. There's likely a bearing at the top mount which is the cause.

You'd need to confirm this is the issue though by feeling the spring for noise/roughnes while the steering is being turned.

It's possible there are multiple worn parts that are contributing to the issue too, but i'd start with top mount bearings/top mounts.

1nzq4wi,Looking for recommendations for first car (¬£1k-¬£1.5k),"I apologise, I know this is probably the most common question on this subreddit, but I've just passed my practical test (manual) and am looking to get my first car. I know absolutely \*nothing\* about cars and don't even know where to start looking, so any suggestions or advice would be welcome (but seriously, explain it like I'm 5).

My ideal budget is ¬£1000-¬£1200 but I'm willing to stretch to ¬£1500 if needs be. Obviously I'm going to be buying used, and I couldn't give less of a shit what it looks like - I'm just hoping to balance the fact that I have very little budget, with wanting to get a car that might actually last me a few years.

So, with a mind that getting something that fits all my criteria and fits within my budget is highly unlikely, here's is list of features I'm looking for that's in a roughly descending order of importance:

* Small (will mostly be driving in urban areas and parking near me is a nightmare. Most journeys will be just me but I do want to be able to take housemates and friends shopping, away for the day, etc. so not after something like a smart car)
* Repairable (ie. make and model that are common enough that it's easy to get parts for and easy to do necessary upkeep, service, repair work etc)
* Fuel efficient (to keep costs down. i also don't love how bad cars are for the environment so ideally I'm not after a make or model that is notorious for its emissions)
* Low insurance cost
* Safe (again I understand this might be a difficult one to balance as larger cars are generally safer for drivers, and car safety generally improves as years go on, but I guess I'm wanting to avoid any makes or models that are notoriously unsafe)
* Has cruise control and other more basic driver assist features
* 5 door if possible, but this is literally last on my list

Obviously once I've got some ideas of makes and models to go away and research with, I know that how much mileage individual cars have and their general condition will massively impact the price and whether it's worth buying them or not. Once I've got some ideas and found some cars on sale locally I'm going to take a friend/family member with me who knows a lot more about cars than I do so I can feel confident in my choice, but I'd massively appreciate any starters!

EDIT: I'd also appreciate any advice for new drivers about owning a first car if anyone has anything to offer (things like whether it's worth getting a dashcam, what kind of stuff to always keep in the car for emergencies and convenience etc.)",1,1759773117.0,3,CartalkUK,1759865577,2025-10-06 17:51:57,2025-10-07 19:32:57,"qwerty_tom (Score: 2): Honda Jazz, Toyota Yaris, Suzuki Swift, Toyota Aygo, Citroen C1, Peugeot 107, Kia Picanto,  Skoda Fabia, VW Polo.

Not that it matters too much, because it won‚Äôt go to the new owner. 

If he wants to test drive it, he needs to confirm he has sufficient insurance to drive THAT vehicle. Third party insurance is ok, but if he smashes it, you will lose your money. 

It‚Äôs an offence to drive without tax, and that will come back to you as the registered keeper. You may or may not be able to pass any fixed penalty back on to him if you have details etc. But I suspect you either have tax until the end of the month.

If he is happy, and wants to pay you. Check any cash thoroughly. Or check your own banking app for confirmation that money has been received. Don‚Äôt trust the app that he shows to say he has made the payment. Don‚Äôt hand over the keys until your banking app shows the money. 

Give him the green slip, not the whole V5. They should still be connected the moment. Do the transfer of registered keeper online on the DVLA website.

1nze3na,Toyota or Approved Dealership refusing to warranty repair leaking water pump. Am I being in the process of getting scammed??,"Need help urgently to see if I'm getting fobbed off by an approved Toyota dealership. 

I've just gone in to fix a front sensor going haywire after driving during a downpour. Asked them to checkout a noise while it was in. Have had my car serviced from this exact branch back in May thus activating the 10 year warranty for another year.

Short Version:

1. Car in Wednesday for front sensor repair, asked them to checkout noise during (noise was present at service earlier too)
2. Same day call back. Say water pump bearings are failing, wanted money for replacement - didn't check if it had a warranty - noticed a change in tune when I said they are the ones who gave me this warranty after the service
3. Friday 3pm - told to pick up car at 5pm.
4. Friday 4pm - told is covered under warranty (fucking duh!?) as it is leaking. But that they can't fix it now because it would take too long! 3 days ffs. But now suddenly they are sure the noise is that pump.
5. Monday - the pump is not covered under warranty anymore. Apparently Toyota do not cover pumps making ""noise"". And as it is only seeping and not a big leak it will not be covered? Because it hasn't failed yet - but the garage are telling me it will fail.

BUT if I drive off with the car as is and it fails this garage will not then cover the engine!

Apparently a 2018 Yaris with less than 45k miles on it after being serviced the water pump is a wear item? Sounds like bullshit, the entire engine is a fucking wear item and I'm guessing the water pump should be pretty crucial here too.

I will add a comment with a lot more detail but does anyone with more knowledge of the Toyota warranty know what I should here?

*incase it helps - the noise itself is a mid bass thump at a low frequency. i.e. dug dug dug. It happens at a higher frequency - the time between dug dug not the sound itself - when the engine is revved matching the rev.

I‚Äôve got a Megane mk3, ‚Äò15 dCi. I bought it about two years ago and then a couple of months later one of the dipped bulbs(it had halogens fitted) burned out. I replaced both bulbs with new halogens, the best I could buy, and after 2-3 months one of them died.
I then fitted LED bulbs on both, and one of them burned out after 7-8 months. I replaced it, but soon after that the other one gave up as well.

Granted, I work nights so I always drive with lights on, but its not far so it adds up to ~40-50 hours/month. Even a crap LED should last much longer than 8 months.

Mine have large heat sinks and a fan.¬†


Personally I wouldn't worry if you have two failures in a few months. If there's a more regular pattern, or consistency, maybe. But don't think you have enough data to point to a problem.


PS you really shouldn't put LEDs in place of main beam incandescent bulbs as the beam pattern will likely blind other drivers. I only have them on high beams where its not so much of a problem because I obviously turn them off when cars are in front.
