1mnte2l,Auto service nightmare,Took my wife’s car to a local small shop for front wheel bearing replacement (2013 Honda civic) and that was Friday and was told it would be ready to pick up Monday. No word from them until 3:30 pm Monday that the new bearing exploded when trying to put it in and sparks were flying. I spent 5 years as a mechanic in the Marines so I’m not that stupid and know for a fact that’s not what happens when you do proper bearing replacement. They told my wife all this btw. Then begin to say we need to order an entire assembly to replace it. My guess is the bearing never exploded and they can’t get the race out of the housing or off the spindle shaft so they are trying to con us into buying an entire assembly. If that was the case I could’ve done it myself. Only reason I had them do it was because I only wanted the bearings done and I don’t have the tools to grind the race out if it or a press to press in the new ones. They said they will send pictures tomorrow. They also said I need to pay for the new bearings. They apparently destroyed. What do I do? I’d like to have it brought to a different shop but idk how now that they have the front end in shambles. Any advice?,2,1754956569.0,2,MechanicAdvice,1755027263,2025-08-11 23:56:09,2025-08-12 19:34:23,"curtludwig (Score: 2): I don't see how you have to pay for their failed effort. Either the bearing was defective in which case the vendor warranties it or they did a poor install in which case they eat that cost.

If I had to guess I'd best they didn't get the bearing straight when they started it and blew it up trying to force it in at an angle. I'd go there and see what they say in person. Often people that will give you some story over the phone won't have the balls to try it in person.

Examine the belt for wear, cracks, or fraying, and check pulley alignment. Spray water on the ribbed side of the belt while the engine is running. If the noise disappears, it's likely a belt issue. If it gets louder, it might be a tensioner problem. If the noise doesn't change, it could be a pulley issue. 
If you remove the belt, spin each pulley by hand and listen for noise or feel for roughness. Replace pulleys with damaged bearings. And ensure the tensioner is functioning correctly and providing adequate tension. If not then replace.

1mnro7u,Need help with some muffler/exhaust questions!,"I have an '01 Honda Accord V6, my exhaust finally rusted out and I'm trying to figure out what my options are. Everything past the straight pipe had too much deterioration to keep. Thanks in advance for any help!

1) Can I just take off the mufflers/connecting pipe and leave this as is? I'm aware I need to be wary of fumes coming through the floor, and that it's technically not legal, but are there any other concerns?

2) If/when I replace the exhaust and mufflers, would it be as simple as buying a connecting pipe and mufflers and clamping to the existing exhaust? I'd like to fix it myself if I'm capable.

3) This might be a dumb one, but does my car *need* 2 mufflers or are there replacement options that would only require 1 with another straight pipe?

2) Yes, ish. You’ll surely need to cut off some portion of the old and/the new and make the two sides meet. Ideally there is a flanged joint where you can separate the rusted section from the surviving section - that would make easier. 
3) I’m guessing that you have one pipe with two devices you have identified as mufflers. One is a muffler and the other is a resonator. Leaving one off will work but you’ll need to bridge the gap. There are plenty of aftermarket exhaust offerings as alternatives to OEM. Google Shopping is your friend. As a sanity check, take it to a muffler shop for a quote - they may point out things you haven’t considered and the cost might be acceptable."

Look for mom and pop shops to get decent prices on install, order the tires to your house. Skip the middleman bullshit at the corpo stores.

Control arm depending on which one and the rust levels it could be a 5 minute job or could be an hour or two.

If I go to take a turn the wheel will hiss, then when I get on my brakes the hissing pauses but wheel goes stiff. Both brake fluid and power steering fluid are within range and not low. I asked some friends and as a quick suggestion they said to check belt (worn but not awful), or that it could be master cylinder especially since brakes are acting up so soon.

I’m not a huge car guy, I do a lot of YouTube and Google searching for issues haha. If anyone might know some solutions or areas of concern to check that would be awesome. If it turns out to be an advanced fix I can take it to a shop if needed.

If you have adequate fluid in both the PS system and brake system, you might consider flushing and bleeding both and replacing with new fluid to start with. DOT 3 or 4 and Dex/Merc is fine. Steering gearboxes don't last forever. I just put on #3 in 11 years.

1mnn8md,Found plastic wrapper under leather trim between backseat and right rear pillar of 2-year-old Volvo V60 - normal or concerning?,"Just discovered a plastic wrapper tucked between the backseat and rear right pillar of my 2023 Volvo V60 (29k km, bought used as a certified Volvo Selekt car) that I got last week. Found it when folding down the rear seats to expand trunk space.

The car is supposedly solid mechanically and passed a third party inspection, but I’m dealing with some cosmetic damage issues (etching on the roof) that the dealer tried to hide from both me and the inspector (a whole other story) by keeping the car dusty until delivery.

The car was also stopped for a very long period of time (6 months, it only drove 50km during that period) that the dealer has stated as being related to admin issues in bringing the car from Volvo Finance (it was originally a lease) to the Volvo Dealer through the certification process.

Now I’m wondering if this wrapper indicates leftover factory protective packaging missed during pre delivery inspection back in 2023 or evidence of interior work / repairs.

I’m also extremely hesitant with this dealer after the roof etching bullshit and the fact the car was certified with that type of structural damage.

Is finding factory plastic wrapping in hidden areas like this normal for a 2-year-old car, or should I be concerned about concealed damage?

Any Volvo techs or experienced owners who can weigh in? Thanks!

I’m starting to wonder if I need to talk to a lawyer…

P.S. - the plastic wrap is extremely visible because I pulled it. Initially it was just a tiny sliver. At first I thought that some plastic wrapper had been “swollen” by the trim when I was lowering the seat while I was storing some boxes but I don’t think I had nothing like that in the trunk: and it’s super jammed into the trim.

I recently had my vehicle at a Subaru dealership for warranty work to replace a head unit that had delaminated and for replacement of the Data Control Module that was found to be draining the battery since the shutdown of the 3G cellular network.  

The car was in their shop for 2 weeks while waiting on parts.  After I picked the car up I made it about 100 yards from the lot when the engine stuttered and stumbled, the check engine light came on, and all of the safety systems disable (Eyesight, RAB, Cross Traffic, etc).  I immediately went back to the service department and the service writer used a handheld scanner and  couldn’t find any codes in the history - the warning lights weren’t on when restarting the car.  We both dismissed it as the computer relearning conditions as the battery had been disconnected for several days.  

7 days later all of the warning lights and check engine light came on again.  I was near an O’Reilly’s so I stopped in to have the codes checked and they found P014A in the history.  I made an appointment with the dealership for the following Friday.   The warning lights weren’t on for the next several days but came on again on Wednesday before my appointment.   Every time I drove the car that day the check engine and safety system disabled lights were on, maybe 3-4 drive cycles.   The lights didn’t come on the next day or when I took the car back to the dealer.  

The dealer was able to see the P014A codes in history, checked the O2 sensors and found them to be working properly.   They found no issues and chalked it up to them not properly ‘initializing the car after removing the battery’.  I asked how much time was needed because I had driven the car for 20-30 drive cycles and around 350 miles in total and the service writer said that it was ‘a fuel pressure issue because they didn’t initialize the car properly’.  I can understand that for the engine hesitation and stumble when first leaving the dealership, but not for the check engine lights to come on two more times, a week and a 1.5 weeks later.

1mnm278,Car engine temperature issues. Is my thermostat bad?,"Reposting with car information. 2009 Pontiac Vibe 1.8L

My car for the last month or so has had issues with the engine temperature spiking. I took it to a mechanic and he said the radiator was cracked and replaced it. Everything seemed ok at first but after a few days the temperature would still spike up to the top of the gauge during a long drive. This time I replaced the thermostat myself, and everything seemed ok. When I was bleeding the system the temperature did not move beyond where it typically sits and for the next couple of weeks things looked ok. But the other day after driving around for almost 2 hours in 100+ degree weather I started seeing the temperature gauge start to fluctuate up and down from its typical spot. Nothing near as bad as before and it would quickly cool back down but I took it back to the mechanic just to double check anything. After verifying the radiator fan worked, he suggested the thermostat was bad because the upper and lower hoses were not at the same temps, one being much hotter than the other.

The thermostat was whatever my local Napa had in stock that fit my car. I know it's not original part quality good, but I'm skeptical a 2 week old thermostat would go out that quickly. Any other things it can be? I don't mind taking back the part and getting another thermostat but I wanted to check if there might be anything else to try. Also, again, the temperature doesn't seem to be going dangerously high (just one tick up on the temp gauge higher than normal) but given the work that's been done on it I've been very paranoid about atypical behavior

If the misfire does not move with the coil then it is not the coil and it is probably the spark plug.  Again just buy one plug and replace that spark plug unless the plugs have not been changed in 50K miles.  In that case just replace them all to rule them out.

1mnlcev,Update on what fell off my car,"Since the last thread sparked way more discussion and conflicting opinions than I had imagined, here is the answer after getting my car to the shop: **it was from the inner part of the left front rotor.** He took it for a test drive to identify the loud noise when it is idling and identified those as coming from the AC compressor switching on and off, not from the brakes. Also he could stop with the breaks. I cannot stress this enough: I had the rear brakes replaced in June and they NEVER mentioned anything about the front breaks. My breaks have never had any issues with noise or feeling off at all. Here is a video the guy sent me (no noise).

For my last post, I seemingly made the mistake of not including enough clarifying details or pictures in the post and only found out after the fact when I couldn't edit the post. Although I included more info in subsequent comments, many people did not read these and I received a whole lot of insults from people missing the full context. So here is the full context:

**1.** My car never made noises or felt weird or weak when using the brakes ever. The ""loudness"" i mentioned only occured at rest when idling or when accelerating and only occasionally for like 3 seconds or so before stopping. The breaks were always and always have been silent. Evidently, the noise was from the AC compressor and not the breaks.

**2.** My car (Nissan Rogue 2011) was last fully serviced in March 2024, it had 80,000 miles on it. I got the oil changed November 2024 and got the parking break, rear rotors, and one of the rear brake pads replaced in June 2025. I tried getting my car serviced in June as well but since March 2024, I had only put on 4,000 or so miles on the car and so they told me it wasn't due for service yet. I brought up the noise it made when idling and they told me ""old cars are just loud sometimes."" I shrugged and figured I would get a full service done in a few more months. At no point during any of these service visits did anyone mention the front breaks. Mechanics have driven my car before to move it between parking lots and they never mentioned the brakes feeling or sounding off. 

**3.** The car has been driven in Minnesota for over a decade and for around 1.5 years in upstate New York. It was a family car that used to belong to my brothers and that I got full possession of 2 years ago, although I don't own the title. I get the undercarriage washed at least once a month (although again I really havent driven that much since Ive been a college student who walks to campus). I have not been responsible for taking it in to get serviced since, again, it has been under my family's possession. 

Moral of the story: leave as little room for ambiguity or misinterpretation as humanly possible in your posts the first time around lol.

Considering that the previous repair folks knew that the back rotors were gunked up enough to be replaced when I got the parking break fixed, I am shocked that they never mentioned anything about the front brakes. Man, with the bad experiences I've seemingly had so far with car service shops, I feel a little lost as to how to actually know if my car will be taken care of.

Well this has been a very interesting few days! Thank you so much to all of those who chose not to be rude and instead offered good faith thoughts and advice to me (or who were funny and lighthearted, it made me feel better haha).

When you wash the undercarriage in the winter months, try using a product called Salt Cutter. It will help neutralize the salt and prevent some of the corrosion you are clearly experiencing. Though it won’t help brake rotors, you should also consider using an undercoating like PFC or Fluid Film, that would help out a lot.

1mnmq3e,"Valvoline “Checked Coolant OK,” Radiator Failed 3 Days Later – Claim Denied & They Blocked My Email","Looking for advice and to warn others.

On **July 22, 2025**, I took my car to **Valvoline** for routine service. My service invoice clearly says:

>

**Three days later** (\~120 miles driven), my radiator failed catastrophically. Repair cost at Pep Boys: **$1,351.59**.

I filed a claim with Valvoline, but they denied it, saying:

* The radiator “wasn’t touched” (contradicts the invoice).
* The leak was on the “right side,” so it couldn’t be related — ignoring that radiators are single integrated systems.

I submitted a rebuttal through the **Better Business Bureau**, pointing out:

* You can’t mark “Coolant checked OK” without interacting with the system.
* Damage or oversight during inspection could easily cause a short-term failure.

Instead of addressing this, Valvoline **blocked my email address** — I can no longer communicate with them directly.

I have:

* Service invoice showing “Coolant checked OK”
* Repair invoice from Pep Boys with cost & diagnosis
* Full timeline and photos

**Questions:**

1. Mechanically — how plausible is it that a radiator can fail this quickly after being “checked OK” without mishandling or missed damage?
2. Legal/consumer — has anyone had success getting companies to pay out in similar situations through BBB, state AG, or social media pressure?

Maybe a year ago I noticed a hissing sound coming from my AC system occasionally. Recently while driving the hissing got really loud then stopped and I noticed my AC no longer blew cold at all.

I called around to a few local shops and the only one that was responsive wanted about $3K to replace the whole system. I went with them because it sounded like they could start right away and I wanted my car back as soon as possible.

3 weeks later now and they just called me and left a message telling me to come get my car they couldn't fix it (no charge). The voicemail mentioned an evaporator core?

It had a failed compressor with metal throughout the system which we suspected from the beginning.

Pushing metal through a system is a worst case scenario. Without special flushing kits and procedures it's a crapshoot to get all the metal out. It's contaminated. Aftermarket parts is just as much as a crapshoot too. 


I would take their offer to pick up the car and find another shop that's willing to get involved. $3000 seems pretty reasonable but an evaporator core will blow that price out of the water. 


If your going to push through definitely go for a OE evaporator because of all the work it takes. I've played the aftermarket game and had to eat a couple warranty jobs. No more.

1mngafb,Appreciate any advice on an AC's low-side service port Schrader valve that's stuck open!,"My car’s A/C was slow to cool. Somewhat warm at first, then cold when on high/recycle or speed above 60 mph. A mechanic friend suggested checking the R134a levels. Manifold gauges showed the low side pegged and almost back to 0, and the high side at 380 psi, So clearly it'll be a trip to the shop.  
  
After shutting the engine down, I removed the high side without issue, but the low-side service port Schrader valve is now stuck open and releases refrigerant when the manifold gauge coupler is removed. (thankfully I wore gloves!). I immediately re-capped it with the manifold coupler, tried re-tightening & re-loosening the coupler a few times hoping to reset it, and also tapping on the side of the valve with a screwdriver hoping to maybe knock it back to closed. No dice, it's still stuck open. Obviously, I now need to REALLY get it to a shop to have them handle it.  
  
So professional advice is now GREATLY appreciated....  
Can I drive it with that coupler still on the low side and with the AC shut off? Should I  pull the A/C fuse to make sure the system doesn't run at all and do further damage?

I looked at the live data and the short-term fuel trim was sitting around +20 percent. The upstream O2 sensor voltage also wasn’t switching much, which pointed to either a vacuum leak or some kind of fuel issue.

We popped the hood and found a loose hose near the intake. After tightening it, the idle smoothed out and the stalling stopped. I still told him it’d be a good idea to stop by a mechanic for a proper check just to be safe, but for now the car seems to be running fine.

1mn26nr,"Please help car people, so stressed","Hi car people, I really need some help on this one.

About to make a cross country (15ish hour) move in my 2014 Ford Fusion Hybrid this weekend to start a new job on Monday (really gave myself a lot of leeway on this one).

Tonight, I randomly started hearing what sounded like a medium sized bug trying to fly through my air vents for a couple seconds, only to have a “Overheating coolant” error and check engine light suddenly pop up about a minute later. I pulled over as soon as I could to a gas station about a mile later, and noticed my coolant was empty. I went ahead and filled it up, then noticing a rather fast leak that drained the reservoir in about a minute. From what I could tell, it looked like the leak originated somewhere near the top of the coolant line since it was dry up until some point just on the upper half of the line.

Although concerned, I was only about 10 minutes away from home and for other reasons really did not have enough patience to call a tow or anything crazy, so I teetered it home half-believing and half-hoping it was just a coolant leak. The check engine light stayed on the whole way there.

When I arrived, I did another inspection to see if anything else was up. Turns out I got some nice brown liquid leaking all over the place coming from the center of the engine compartment somewhere, and faint smoke coming from somewhere as well. An oil and coolant leak is super not good from what I understand.

Due to the noise I heard before all the issues, I’m super worried that I had some major error that just destroyed everything in there, I’m not nearly knowledgeable enough to know how/what though. I’m hoping you car people might have a better idea what’s going on.

Should I even hobble it the 7 minutes to the nearest workshop tomorrow morning, or should I call a tow truck? I don’t want to damage it any more than I maybe already have. I was already stressing hard, but this happening now of all times is putting me over the edge, I have no idea how/if I’ll be able to do this move now. Please let me know anything y’all have got or what I should do going forwards, I really need the help.

I need the sleep for now, but will check in the morning, thanks in advance.

1mnt7aw,Are these rotors and caliper shot? (2014 Fiat 500c GQ),"(Picture shows the inside of the rotor on the left and the outside on the right.  Both front brakes have this issue.)

Question #1: Am I right to assume these calipers and rotors are shot?

I recently bought a 2014 Fiat 500c GQ because it only had 37K on it and it's a fun car.  The one issue I noticed on the test drive was the brakes. The pedal pulses as the brakes are applied. It still stops fine. I figured I could pull the rotors off and have them resurfaced if I wanted to. I was in the process of removing the front left rotor today and I saw that the inside disk surface was rusty and a bit rough. The outside looks shiny and normal.  (As noted in the photo)  So, it looks like one of the caliper cylinders is stuck (Or is this one cylinder and things aren't floating properly?) and I assume it damaged the rotor as well.  With only 37K on a 12 year old car I'm guessing that it wasn't driven for months at a time and things might have frozen up.

Question #2: Can I put standard Fiat 500 ""Pop"" brakes on my Fiat 500c GQ?

The Fiat 500c GQ version supposedly has Abarth ""racing"" brakes. That's nice, but it's not important to me. 99.99 percent of the time this car will be driven like an ordinary car, mostly by my mild mannered wife. The Abarth/GQ brake calipers cost hundreds more than standard. So, if I'm going to just replace the calipers and rotors/pads, can I just go with the cheapo Pop version on Amazon?  The two 19mm caliper bolts are 4"" apart and the four 17mm lug nuts are 3.75"" apart. Do Pop and GQ/Abarth match up in those patterns? I don't want to drop another $1000 into this for a job that I could do for $250.

I have a 2022 Lexus NX Base (still under warranty) with a noticeable vibration between \~15–22 mph **only under acceleration**. It’s most pronounced at certain RPMs and seems to come from the front of the car. Once I pass that speed/RPM range, it smooths out completely.

Here’s what’s been done so far:

* Dealer visit #1: Told tires were worn → replaced with new tires at Costco.
* Dealer visit #2: Told it could be Balancing issue with tires → did road force balance.
* Dealer visit #3: Scheduled end of the week.

When I coast through that speed range, it’s smooth — vibration only happens when applying throttle.

Apparently it’s a GM cold air intake (the intake itself says K&N so idk, also we just got this Tahoe 3 months ago). I took it to Oreillys so i could see what the code was and it was for a map sensor. I bought the sensor, but the check engine light went away on the way home. I still replaced the sensor but it almost sounded as if it was bringing in way more air and the weird acceleration problems were still there. I changed the map sensor back to the old one and decided I’ll keep an eye on how it’s driving. It drove fine the next few weeks, the jumpy acceleration was hardly there. Well today, after a 4 hour roadtrip, the jumpy acceleration came back and the dash was telling me to service the air system.

So, the A/C will work if it is below 80F outside. It works most of the time if I am on the interstate going over 70MPH. Now here’s the kicker, sometimes I will leave work (sitting in traffic) and the A/C works great. Most of the time if it works I will turn the fan speed to the max and no issues. But if I turn that fan down at all, it A/C immediately stops working and you can start to feel hot humid air. Other days I will leave and I just don’t get any cool air until I get on the interstate.

The compressor kicks on every single time I hit the A/C button. My electric fan for the motor is working just fine. I don’t hear any hissing or gurgling sounds. Finally, the refrigerant pressure on the low side is correct so I’m not low on Freon.

How did you check the refrigerant level? Do you have an OEM reference graph for low side pressures at idle and you're using that to measure? How does the high and low side look while the A/C is on max? The liquid and discharge lines should be hot and cold respectively and have a notable (probably 100F +) difference in temperature between them. 

  
The issue is that to most of these questions there's multiple things that could be the cause of the symptom. Your A/C is turning on, so it's getting the correct signal and has at least enough Refrigerant left in there for the sensor to give the compressor the go to turn on. But outside of that it's impossible to diagnose online, mainly because there's not enough information. 

Take it to a shop and have them look at it. They can evacuate and recharge the system, ensure that there is the proper amount of refrigerant, and then further look for the problem. Either way, if you can't evacuate and recharge the system by yourself, this problem is NOT GETTING FIXED without going to mechanic to have that done in the first place.

1mn3qv3,How do I convince some stranger to sell me their Thunderbird that hasn't moved in 8+ years?,"# I (17 yo) have had my eyes on this vintage Thunderbird since I was in 3rd grade.

Ever since me and my family had moved to where we are currently living, there has always been this property that we have driven past that has this yellow Thunderbird just sitting outside all day and night. And for 8+ years it has not moved a muscle. Me and my dad have always talked about this car and anyone who has gotten to talk to me about cars knows about this specific Thunderbird and my interest in it.

A few months ago, I had gotten this gut feeling that I needed to go and talk to the owner about this car, a feeling that has just been lingering with me and has not shaken since. This last weekend I finally convinced my dad to go and drive to the property with me to go and talk to this guy about the car. We had pulled up and realized that who we *thought* had owned the car was really the neighbor, who I ended up having to leave my information with.

I have a singular picture of this car and it was one that I snagged quickly. Getting as close as I could to the vehicle, I was finally able to identify that it is, in fact, a 1962 Thunderbird, based on the sideview mirror shape and the style of the trunk and break lights.

**LONG STORY SHORT**: I need this car. The owner has not reached out to me at all, but I plan on making a second trip when I get the chance again. ( I was just there like 2 days ago and don't know if the neighbor even gave my info to him.) I have not met this person, and I have no idea what he is like. When my father and I walked around the property we saw that he had a bunch of other project cars that were just as old and not taken care of as the Thunderbird (This thing is boarder line a rust bucket and sits under a tree with weeds growing around it. It's a miracle mother nature has not totally taken over this car.)

This is literally my dream car and however long it takes to restore, rebuild, replace parts, I do not care. I am about to pick up a second job to start saving up to buy it off of him (hopefully! That is the dream.).

**WHAT I AM ASKING**: What is the best approach I can make to this guy as to not totally turn him away from my offer?

From what I picked up he is definitely into restoring older cars and has a bunch of other projects already. But the Thunderbird has not moved a single inch in the last 8 years I have lived here and i basically drive by it almost every day.

I don't know his age, how he is as a person, anything. He is a complete mystery as of right now. I haven't a clue if anyone else has ever made him an offer on this car, but its in such a condition I'm not sure anyone but me would.

My best guess as to the story behind him owning it is that he either inherited it from a family member, or it is just a project he bought off of someone and just hasn't gotten around to fixing it yet. or he is just using its parts? I'm completely speculating here.

Has anyone ever done something similar when looking at an unused vintage car? Any advice or words of wisdom? Anything is appreciated!

1mnt2td,Warranty explanation on Hyundai Sonata 2019,"I’ve had this car since 2020 and I’ve been having problems with the engine after the first year of owning it. The last straw for me after taking it to the dealership many times for expensive repairs I cannot afford was when my engine began rumbling like crazy. Not new for me because the last time it happened it was a spark plug problem. It ran just fine for a couple of months until recently the rumbling happened again. Took it to a mechanic and changed out the spark plugs again until they ran it and it was still rumbling and said it was my second cylinder misfire and after checking inside they find my piston is damaged with little to no pressure in the 2nd cylinder; something like that, I don’t know much about cars but ultimately they said I need a new engine to fix it which is also not new to me. so off to the dealership I go to get it checked out and hoping to God it may be under the 10 year 100,000 mile warranty. (My car is just at about 97,000) after the multi-point inspection they call me back saying it is a 2nd cylinder misfire and they would just repair the cylinder ITSELF which would run me about $7k which I obviously do not have. They would also take the engine to get it inspected to make sure the other cylinders are fine but not repair the whole engine on its own. The reasons I’m in this subreddit is for 1. To find out more Information about wtf is actually wrong with my car. I know it’s a cylinder misfire but am I being screwed just cause they only want to repair the cylinder. And 2. I just wanna vent about the stressful situation that is the damages to my car that I cannot fix financially. The most stressful thing about this is wanting to know if my car could be under warranty to get a replacement engine and they just tell me the repairs is all they can do and refuse to tell me what damages the engine must have for it to be covered under warranty.

1mnszrh,Someone please help before I smash this car into a tree.,"I'm at my wits end with this 2003 SVT Focus. 

As you can see/hear in the video it's sputtering on acceleration and barely even wants to get to 5k rpm... My foot was to the floor. No CEL even after multiple drives. 

I've had the car for a couple months, fixed a lot of stuff and had it running great. 

Long story short: the other night I went for gas, filled it up with 93 octane as usual and then went for a cruise. I had yet to really test this thing out since I was constantly working on it. So I tried to do a quick little burnout. 

Came to a stop, put it in first, clutch in, revved it up to ~6k and dumped the clutch. The tires spun for about a second and then I lost all power and heard a pretty alarming clunk from the rear. 

I drove home and everything felt normal, however I did notice the idle wasn't as smooth as it was but nothing too alarming. 

Next day I go to drive.. runs like trash. Barely idles and tries to die/stumbles on acceleration. Did some troubleshooting and gave up.. I let the car sit for a week.

A week later I come out, started it and it ran smooth as butter???? Drove it around the block a few times, not a sputter, no hesitation, the vvt/IMRC was working at 4500rpm as expected and all was good.

Took my other car to work, came home after and decided to take a cruise in the Focus.. magically it's running like trash again?? 

Spent 8 hours with it today troubleshooting to no avail. 

Although I did discover something weird.. I disconnected the inertia switch to shut off the fuel pump and relieve the pressure in the fuel line so I can change the filter but after cutting the fuel pump the car was able to idle (and even drive back and forth in the driveway) for a good couple of minutes before finally dying.?? Excess fuel pressure??? And even when I pulled the filter after that it still had a ton of pressure in the line that sprayed all over. 

Things I've tried already:
-Replaced fuel filter
-reset ECU. 
- B12 fuel treatment
-temp bypassed inertia switch
-smoke test for vacuum leak
-cleaned maf
-observed live data to check O2, TPS and engine load (engine load is a little high at idle & timing advance changes frequently)
-temp bypassed evap/purge system
-checked all plugs/gap and checked wires
-inspected ignition coil (prev owner claims it's only 8 months old)
-sprayed brake clean all over to check vacuum (even though smoke test showed no smoke, just wanted to double check) 
-inspected vvt solinoid
-inspected wiring harness as much as possible
-inspected underneath to figure out what the clunk noise was, but found nothing.. I'm chocking it up to the suspension suddenly dropping from the loss of power because the springs are shot. 

I'm going to throw a fuel pump at it sometime this week when I calm down and get some energy back. Honestly if that doesn't fix it I'm ready to cut my losses and pull anything of value off and scrap the car. I've spent more time under it than I have in it.

My car got stuck in 4Lo the other day. The mechanics have tried everything, but it won't switch back to 4Hi (Its a model that only has 4Hi/4Lo options - no 2Hi). They recommended next step is taking transfer case apart or replacing it (approx 11hr job) and they aren't even sure the parts are available for such an old vehicle. Estimate is $3270 USD ($4500 CAD). 

Not sure if I just get rid of the car or bite the bullet and keep driving my car into the ground? I live in a small town, so it's tough to sell my car for parts as there aren't many buyers.

They are a stout vehicle. Someone will buy it, whole or for parts, and use it for off-roading or whatever.  If you listed it for sale as ""runs, drives, has some rust, but stuck in 4 Low"", some back yard mechanic will buy it from you.

A junk yard transfercase isn't that expensive.  I used to swap them in other vehicles pretty quickly, but never did one on a Toyota 4Runner

4Runner labor estimates are as high as 12 hours, but that is dependent on removing the transmission, which a backyard shop or small independent shop probably wouldn't bother doing. You can get around them enough to undo the transfercase without taking out the transmission with it.

What might be happening is that your TXV (thermal transfer valve) is stuck or not operating properly so it opens up once letting the pressure into the evaporator core but not closing. The valve is temperature controlled mechanically kind of like a thermal coil valve. 

Anyways, I would stop using it and either take it to a professional or get educated on how to service your AC system. If sealant or leak finder was ever used, it can gum up over time. You probably should take the system apart and inspect each unit minus the evaporator core although you can still flush the core out.

Nissan 100NX GA16DE manual B13 (NX1600 for USA).
257k km  (~160k miles)

I need some advice here:

 The cv joint was replaced because it sounded worse than my knees when i stand up, the sound disappeared for a while but in the following weeks it came back, and it got worse and worse (even when stopping or accelerating in a straight line). It's got like 400km since the repair.

 The suspension components SHOULD to be alright as they were also replaced (control arm, ball joint, tie rods and swaybar connecting rods are new).

First, it was the usual clonk clonk clonk of a bad CV joint, after the replacement, it was more like a creaking, like an old wooden ship.


Today, after driving to work, i put reverse to park and, when lifting the clutch, the car didnt move but i could hear the axle banging around. After it happened and the shaft disengaged from the CV joint, the creaking still happens.

What do you think could have happened?
One of my friends (transmission mechanic) blamed the splines on the shaft (which is the factory one): he says that i could be worn out and the clip could not handle it anymore. But if the noise keeps ocurring there must be something else happening.

So yeah, i got no idea of why this happened, could it be the wheel bearing? Maybe i over steered?

I'm just guessing now. I put the car to repair in another workshop but they mostly work in European cars and really dont have experience with Nissan, like most mechanics around here, if its not Audi, BMW or VW they got got 0 experience) so i want to get a little bit more feedback.

1mndn0s,False Overheat warning?  Garage decided to add K-seal...  Citroen C3 ii 1.4vti - Did they really need to add it?,"Citroen c3 1.4VTI 95hp - 100k miles.

I had an ""engine temperature high"" warning after a short drive.  I stopped driving immediately.  I checked the coolant level which was normal.  I waited 30 minutes and completed my journey (400 yards, thankfully).

I started the engine the following morning.  The engine overheat warning came on straight away.

Note: the dashboard does not have a thermometer.  It has an LED which shows BLUE when cold, and then goes out when normal.  It shows RED when over temperature.  It was showing RED immediately.

There was no Engine Management Light lit.  I noticed the blue LED was not coming on even though the engine was definitely cold.  It normally remained illuminated for at least 3 miles.  (since repair it goes out after less than a mile).

Oil was normal (no milkshake).  Coolant levels normal. No bubbling coolant reservoir.  No white smoke or other smoke.

I suspected a faulty sensor as the warning occured immediately after starting.  Or, on 2 occasions did not come on for a few minutes (I turned it off as soon as it came on).  I booked it into the local garage - 3 miles away.

They agreed it could be a faulty temp sensor/thermostat.   The thermostat housing included the temp sensor so they replaced it.....   

but then.  They said they suspected it could be the early stages of a head gasket failure so they added 1 bottle of K-seal (coolant system sealant) to the coolant without telling me.  Anyway, this was nearly a year ago and it's been running fine since then.  They warned me that if it is a head-gasket problem, and the K-seal works, it could be good for a while.  He said he had another client where it's still holding after 2 years.

My concern is that the car had no other symptoms of a head-gasket failure that I could see.  They did not say if they confirmed it by checking for exhaust gas in the coolant etc.  The coolant needs flushing now as there's a lot of residue of the k-seal around the reservoir.  Did they really need to add the k-seal? 

Currently the cooling system is working normally.  Temperatures not exceeding 100°C and heater is working very well.

The liquid is clear, does not have a smell, and has a viscosity higher than water but less than oil. 

What I have checked on the car so far: 

Coolant reservoir was low - Filled with water to test and left overnight: Nothing under the car, reservoir was at the same level. Started and ran at temperature for several minutes: Nothing under the car, no evidence of puddling anywhere in the engine bay, but reservoir level dropped.

Brake fluid reservoir full. 

Oil level has not changed (the car does leak oil, but this is definitely not oil).

Car starts and runs normally; no smoke, smells, or odd noises. I haven't driven it on the road yet but I went back and forth in my driveway (mostly to test the brakes) and didn't notice anything different.

The battery is less than 2 weeks old and the voltage gauge reads normally. The positive battery terminal is, admittedly, pretty corroded.

I'm guessing it's the starter relay based on old forum posts but am not confident.

Any ideas of what this could be and how to test for it before buying the parts?

TIA for any ideas, I'm stumped!

1mn4rsc,Is it okay that I replaced with non-OEM brand for my spark plugs?,"Title.

I have a Lexus NX200T 2017, around 60K miles. Previous owner did not replace spark plugs at 40k so Im just replacing it now (got the car recently).

For some reason, all Google search shows that Lexus/toyota uses Denso for OEM parts (**I don't know why! I did a search again and everyone says Denso!!**). So I bought these ""[Denso 5345 IKH22 Iridium Power Spark Plug""](https://www.densoproducts.com/denso-5345-ikh22-iridium-power-spark-plug), they are compatible as I checked it on Rock Auto as well as AutoZone/O'Reilly websites.

**But upon replacing them, I pulled out the old plugs and saw that its actually an NGK plug. I was surprised so I checked owners manual and what the heck it indeed states it should use ""**[NGK DILFR7K9G""](https://www.ngk.com/ngk-91961-dilfr7k9g-laser-iridium-spark-plug)**.**

I already replaced the spark plugs with the Denso ones I listed though... Is this bad? I don't know what I should do here. Should I buy NGK spark plugs and replace them again?

I think [Denso 5345 IKH22](https://www.densoproducts.com/denso-5345-ikh22-iridium-power-spark-plug) I bought has  
\- 0.032'' (0.08mm) gap

\- center electrode (6mm)

\- Nickel for ground electrode

whereas [NGK](https://www.ngk.com/ngk-91961-dilfr7k9g-laser-iridium-spark-plug) has

\- 0.036'' (0.09mm) gap

\- Platinum for ground electrode

1mn2nss,Timing chain issue right after repairs?,"Looking for opinions as this has transpired and doesn’t seem right to me.

I just got my 2017 Audi S5 with 170,000km serviced and repaired. I had the PCV valve replaced (had a small leak), DCT service, coolant bleed and my supercharger flaps were stuck open. Paid $3k for everything.

Got the car back and after the 3rd day a rattle started coming from my engine. I took the car back to the mechanic to check it and they said it was the timing chain, could do nothing about it and I can drive the car for another 30,000km before it had to be replaced. It is common for the age of the car I get that but I don’t trust that they thoroughly had checked the car over and gave that reason to deflect from potentially installing something incorrect, component coming loose or just screwing something up in general.

6 days later the noise is louder and worse. I can hear it more on acceleration (I haven’t been driving it that much as I have a beater for work and my gf’s car we drive). This noise was never there before the repairs. The noise is constant even when the engine is warm. I’ve never had low oil pressure and have always topped up as needed.

1mmyh6q,Engine heath based on diagnostic test.,"2010 Subaru legacy Gt with 200k miles. 

I’m trying to determine the health of this motor. No issues with daily driving and no codes. The only intermittent event I notice is that the radiator system seems to reject coolant back into the reservoir. It’ll push so much out that the top hose/ top bar of the radiator is partially empty when cold. Even after burping the system and filling right up to the neck. 

It’s not burning coolant, it’s displacing it. It held pressure fine, so I thought it could be early signs of a bad gasket. However it passed a hydrocarbon test (fluid remained blue). I’m even thinking a tiny pinhole leak might be occurring when the motor is hot. Operating temps are within limits as well. 

I used a borescope to peek inside the engine and don’t see any tail signs other than what I think is ring wash? It looks uniform on each cylinder so I assume that’s just wear. I’ve also done a compression test and they were all within 5 psi from each other.

Am I missing anything obvious?

1mns219,Just Park - how the hell do you know how long you've been there if they don't count?,"I parked at Woolley Services last week for *about* 2 hours and left since I'd seen a maximum of 2 hours free, just to check if I'd gone over or not managed to snap a photo of their bizarrely tiny and hard to read sign before leaving and then later I put my reg in to see if I owed them anything.

All it did was ask me the time I arrived and left.

How the fuck would I know that? That's not how anybody parks. I don't pay to park between 14:32 and 16:38 anywhere else, I either buy a fixed ticket or pay at the gate or the machine before leaving so the barrier comes up.

So I have no clue if I'm about to get a fine since it wasn't made clear that I was supposed to be counting from the actual time how long I'd been there! They obviously must have enforcement cameras so why would they withhold that info? 

Seems pretty bullshit that I might get a PCN for going like 15 minutes over (I have no clue) when they didn't even tell me I was supposed to be the one counting... if they have automated enforcement then why aren't they using the same system to tell me how much I owe them? Feels like it is set up to trick you into accidentally owing them £100 for staying 4 minutes too long. 

Do you think there's any grounds to appeal any PCN that comes my way on the grounds of it wasn't made clear how I'm supposed to write down my exact arrival time manually and that they won't tell me even though they are monitoring me for overstay? That just seems like bollocks to me.

Edit: and the thing is, I was okay with paying if I made the mistake of going over. But since they want my exact times, I couldn't pay since I didn't know when! If it had been length based I'd have just paid for 2 hours 30 to be safe... I thought the app would either know exactly when I arrived and left, or would be just paying per hour or something. But no.

**Edit 2: can I just make clear that Just Park is an app based system with ANPR enforcement that at no point makes it obvious that it isn't going to automatically calculate your parking fee even though every other parking system I've come across does, plus they have the ANPR cameras right there in order to do it!

JustPark don’t own the car parks, the ANPR cameras, or deal with the enforcement. It’ll be a company like parking eye who own the cameras or another company like that. This is who you would receive the PCN from. 

JustPark etc are simply a payment provider. They send the data of who has paid for parking over to the enforcement company via a system link, if someone has stayed over two hours the enforecement company check the data and if it matches to a valid booking there’s no issue. JustPark take a fee for providing the service. This is how they make money from it. So say you pay £5 they’ll take £0.50p for processing the booking and then the owner of the car parks gets £4.50 (made up figures, every contract is different). 

So really, your beef is with the people who own the carpark and/or the enforcement company. They wanted to offer app based parking on a shoe string budget, because it costs them nothing. There is much more comprehensive parking solutions like the ones you’ve mentioned (direct links to the ANPR cameras etc) but they’re more expensive to provide and therefore eat into their profits. 

I get that it’s proper annoying though but just thought some context about why they often don’t know the time you arrive / leave would be useful. 

Basically unless it explicitly states “pay on exit” it’s safe to assume they expect you to use the app like a digital coin machine and pay on arrival. Even then I’d still note the time you arrived as the tech is often glitchy af."

Much of the dogma around roadcraft does feel very dated. However it does mostly have a point, it's just not a point that has much value at normal road speeds or in an average car. It's designed to get literally anyone to a safe standard of driving in literally any vehicle, including non synchromeshed lorries and four litre jag mkII's without power steering. 

That said, not overlapping brakes and gears does have value when you're pressing on on the road (you're much less likely to destabilize the car with a mis timed shift) and push pull steering done accurately and smoothly has it's place. The fundamentals of the system of car control is valuable, in breaking everything down into phases so that you're only doing one thing at a time. 

Primarily the most useful bits are observation, reading the road, anticipation and planning. Driving with your eyes open and brain engaged really. 

If you're not getting on with it you need a different observer. I'm sure there are enthusiasts with a sense of humor who can make it a worthwhile experience. Alternatively, join the police, wait 3-5 years and get on an advanced/pursuit course. It's a absolute hoot.

I can relate to you saying you feel less confident. I went into my driving course thinking I was an ok driver, but they do absolutely deconstruct your driving and build you back up from first principles.

It’s best to buy a car with full or almost full service history (ask the seller on the phone if it has full service history and if not then ask the years it has missed a service during the cars life span), deep inspect the car (look at a YouTube video for what to check), research the car on google for reliability, check the features (does it have AC, CarPlay, Bluetooth), check the insurance class and run an insurance quote (use a new browser with a vpn and fake details on comparison websites) and test drive the car to see if you like it and if it feels solid. 

Every used car is a gamble but Japanese (Toyota and Honda) are absolute beasts for reliability which is why Taxi drivers tend to have them, even though I don’t really like their designs imo. Insurance can be expensive (check the ‘running costs’ section when viewing a car on auto trader) on these cars as they tend to be used by Taxi drivers. 

South Korean (Hyundai & Kia) are decent alternatives with decent reliability. Insurance is usually cheap on these cars. 

Ford and Vauxhall have the best used price but that’s because they have a bad reputation for reliability, but it’s best to research the car you want and 100% get full service history. Insurance is likely high unless you find a specific model that doesn’t have much crashes. 

From my experience, French cars like Peugeot have really good tech but they’re unreliable in my family experience. Insurance is usually cheap on these cars. I would avoid them, despite how pretty the 5008 is. 

Volkswagen and SEAT are decent cars with okay reliability but can be overpriced. They can have timing belts (check on google) which need to be replaced every 5 years and tend to have shitty water pumps. I think they’re pretty cars but their repair costs are apparently high. They also have high insurance class as boy racers love these brands.

1mnos8q,Should I sell my car for an e30,"Hey guys, first post here.

I currently drive a 2017 Alfa Romeo Giulia 2.0. Lately, I’ve been falling out of love with it one because of various electrical gremlins that have left me stranded a few times leaving me with little trust, but also because it’s just too fast to really enjoy without either breaking the speed limit or driving in a way I’m not comfortable with. Since getting a 125cc bike, I’ve realised I enjoy pushing slower cars to their limits more than holding back in something quick.

Which has me thinking about a BMW E30 325i.

A friend at work owns two that she daily’s and knows them inside-out, and I’ve driven her 318 before and fell in love with it. The E30 wouldn’t be my daily (I’ve got the bike for that and I don’t do a lot of driving anyway), but I know they’re getting old now and I’d probably be taking on a project no matter how well maintained the car previously was or will be.

Truth is, I’m already emotionally sold on the idea of owning one I might just need a wake-up call before I do something stupid after already finding a very good well looked after example near me 

Would going for an E30 be a reasonable decision for a fun, occasional car, or am I setting myself up for a lot of hassle compared to just keeping the Giulia?

1mnooum,Non stop-start battery in stop-start car - issues?,"I've recently discovered that my shitbox which is meant to have a special start-stop battery, actually has a regular 12v. I didn't even realise it was meant to be start-stop when I bought it as there aren't any buttons for it or branding to suggest it should be and I don't do much driving where it would ever kick in anyway.  
It doesn't seem to have any issue using lights, radio, etc. Is this likely to cause an issue?

But there's a couple of other random problems, and I'm wondering if they could be related or I'm barking up the wrong tree completely.  
The ""ipod"" usb socket in the glove box recognises my iphone, but charges it quite slow. If I unplug my phone and plug in a cheap bluetooth adapter, it comes on, but the light flashes instead of being steady and doesn't seem to work. I've tested the adapter on a usb plug at home and it works fine, so I don't know if it's getting enough power. Then again, the car is so old, it's labelled 'ipod' so maybe it was never meant to have enough power to charge anything, like how some sockets don't accept ext hard drives, etc?  
I thought I'd get around this using a cigarette lighter->usb adapter, but the cigarette lighter doesn't seem to work at all. I've found and checked the fuse and that seems fine.

Also, the air con works fine, but only the fans from the centre to the left. The right hand side vents (both, either side of the steering wheel) don't blow at all, hot or cold. The manual seems to suggest these are all off the same fuse, so I can't work out how half can work and half don't?

Hi all,
Sorry if this is a silly question but lots of conflicting information about. 

I have just driven down to Cornwall for a holiday, on the way down i noticed a crack in the windscreen. It's covered on my insurance and I have booked in with autoglass. However, they have said due to sensors they need to order the parts which may take a week.

After we noticed the crack i pulled over and could see what looks to be a small chip from a stone maybe and the crack spreads around 5 inches below. While we carried on the crack has spread another 5-10mm.

I will need to travel a bit over 200 miles to get home so am worried it will continue to spread and could be dangerous. 

It's on the passenger side so not in my line of sight.

So my question is, am I safe to drive it the 200 odd miles home (and whatever extra to get it to autoglass)?

Is there anything I could do now to strengthen the crack so last the trip? It's around 5-6 inches in length. While very close to the edge its hard to tell if it goes to the very edge due to it being black underneath. 

I am able to feel the crack with my fingernail on the outside but nothing from inside the car.

Your insurer work for you and as a business want you to renew next year when your policy is up. So they will make sure as much as they can anyway. That the repairs are top notch OEM parts. The courtesy car is a match to you own vehicle and as its not your fault admiral will be paying anyway. "
1mndsoj,Long term diesel market value,"Random question, I’m contemplating buying a “performance” diesel car (435d) before I’m too old and ICE cars are a thing of the past. I’ve a budget of around £20k. One thing at the back of my mind is that the general public seem to be on a witch hunt and hate diesels.  Most manufacturers have dropped diesels from their ranges including BMW (except suvs) and more and more cities are making emissions stricter. 

In 5 years time or so, do you think diesels will be priced off or barred from the road, and parts will become scarcer and more expensive. Leading to a car that is worth around £20k now to becoming worthless?

1mndlgu,S63B44T2 Oil Usage,"To all the owners of S63B44T2 in their M5/M6/X5M/X6M, what's your oil consumption like? For background:

Bought a second hand F85 X5M in April, service history was perfect and the car was well looked after going off the paperwork and service history. The car was on roughly 40,000 miles at purchase and I've done roughly 3000ish miles with 2 1L Top ups in that time.

The first one was around 1,800 miles.  
The second one was around 1,200 miles.

The car had a major service prior to me purchasing. With the first oil top up, I didn't think, much of it as I've had the warning come up before on my F80 M3 after an oil change, however when the second one came up, it brought up a little concern.

I've read on Bimmerpost and a few other places, that naturally the S63 drinks some oil, but is this normal? Reading online it seems to be within threshold of what BMW say is acceptable, I've also spoken to the dealer I bought the car from who's also said in his experience 1L/1,000 miles is expected/acceptable but obviously taking that with a pinch of salt.  
Are there areas to look out for with leaks? I've read PCV/Valve Covers/Valve Stem Seals and worst case scenario, Piston Rings?

Absolutely no smoke at all coming out of the exhaust, tried on both a warm engine and slightly warm engine (don't shoot me for revving an engine not fully warmed up).

The car is my girlfriends daily driver, rarely pushed hard, I've probably pushed it once or twice as when I drive it I have my son with me, so I don't push it. No smoke at all, no burning smell and no obvious leaks that I can see, granted I haven't got it up on a ramp and removed undertrays yet. 

UK based, so legally I can raise an issue within 6 months of purchase and could get a refund in full/repair/replacement, the dealer does have the opportunity to repair. I love the car, so ideally want to avoid giving it back.

Thanks for any help!",2,1754920407.0,8,CartalkUK,1755027263,2025-08-11 13:53:27,2025-08-12 19:34:23,"Matt_Moto_93 (Score: 2): How much oil are you topping up? I assume it's a litre each time? (I'm not familier with BMW's, but I know that for most vehicles, low oil on  a traditional dipstick requires a litre to bring it back to the ""full"" mark, and I think this is the same with the BMW electronic system)

Many manufactueres sort of generally state that up to a litre per 1000 miles is ""acceptable"" oil consumption. You're nearing that (if what I read is right and you topped up after 1,200 miles from the previous top-up?), so if I were you I'd have it investigated. It could well be the PCV valve (not uncommon) but there could be other things. If it was leaking that much oil you'd notice it, even with all the covers underneath. Worth having a check though. You might have a few sperate isues all causing oil loss.

The other possibility is use by the turbo - but it'd be noticable (and also unfortunate at this age and mileage!). In any case, have it diagnosed.

Could also be a faulty unit giving incorrect measurments!

Repairs to structural components must be properly carried out and appear to be as strong as the original structure. This requires the use of suitable materials and any plating or welding extends to a sound part of a load-bearing member.

You can only pass spot welded repairs if the original panel was spot welded and the original panel or section has been removed. Stitch or plug welding can be used instead of spot welding.

In all other circumstances, patch repairs must be continuously seam welded.

Some vehicle manufacturers have recommended repair methods that use MIG brazing, a combination of adhesive bonding and riveting, or amalgamations of these with other joining methods. Such repairs are therefore acceptable unless they are clearly inadequate.

1mn9oom,Help on choosing a new Car!!!!!!?,"For Preface:
I have owned a Nissan Qashqai+2 for the last 11 years and this new car will be my first time owning an automatic.

Hi everyone, first post here, so go easy on me!

I’m 57 and after two decades of being a sensible and practical parent (driving MPVs/Basic 7 seaters for the kids), all four of mine have now grown and have their own vehicles. I’ve always made sensible and economical car choices due to my large family, but now I’d like something a bit more luxurious.

Here’s what I’m after:

1. Good on fuel (40+mpg). Preferably diesel as I do regular long-distance drives, however I could get swayed into a hybrid (either PHEV or Mild)

2. Spacious and roomy enough for 5 full-sized adults (6'0ft+)

3. Reasonable maintenance costs

4. Ideally an SUV but unfortunately not an estate car :((( (my elderly parents struggle with the lower seating position of estates)

5. A Big practical boot ( I regularly transport heavy and large items between houses)

6. Easy access physical controls for infotainment and climate control. I currently do not mind touchscreens at the moment however I do have a tremor in my hand which is currently suppressed however it may return as I get older so physical buttons is a plus.

7. Something that will last, given that it will be well serviced and maintained by me.

Budget: £20–25k

So far I’m a bit overwhelmed with the options and the market, as the last time I bought a car was 11+ years ago, so I’d love any thoughts or recommendations and advice. What would you get if you were in my shoes?

Currently driving a 2018 1.0L Astra (manual) and looking to go automatic. I now work in the city and my manual has become a real drag. I think my Astra is worth around £6-8k, and I currently own it outright.

I'm looking to get something that I'll enjoy being in when in bumper to bumper traffic. I've got heated seats and apple car play at the moment, and want to at least keep those as features in a new car.

My questions are, should I consider leasing if I'm considering PCP? How do I know if PCP is right for me? I own my astra, so can sell it and use the money as a deposit. However, if I do that, when my PCP ends will I be stuck needing to produce another big deposit, only this time with no car to sell?

The upside is that you get a brand new car every couple of years with everything covered under warranty.

The Kia Sportage is a solid car, but it’s big. If you don’t genuinely need the space, it is overkill and not the best choice when it comes to squeezing into tight city spots.

For mostly town driving, go hybrid mate. You’ll glide around silently on electric in the city, with the battery recharging at speed and no plugging in required.

In terms of PCP, you won't own the car at the end and therefore won't have a deposit for your next car. When the term ends you'll need to either pay off the remainder of the finance agreement (balloon payment) at which point you'll own it. Refinance it on an HP agreement or something sort of loan, at the end of which you'll likely own it. Or, you can give it back, but then you have no car and no budget for one either.

Seat Leon - seems solid all round, and you get VW quality without the badge premium.

Colour-wise if you want something exciting you can get bright red or blue ones (guess that’ll depend on the football team you support - the missus is a Pompey fan so was strongly against a red one!)

Chassis rot sounds BAD. Are you going to weld it? It may not have long before it is terminal.

1mn5b89,Car insurance uninsured driver promise,"My car insurance is due for renewal next month and I have obtained quotes. Tesco Bank has come out as the cheapest non-black box policy. They have three different levels of cover and I am trying to decide between the two cheapest. 

The main differences are that the cheaper product excludes windscreen cover and the 'uninsured driver promise'. I'm ok with the windscreen as it's a known cost and I know I can afford it in the unlikely event that my windscreen needs to be repaired / replaced, but I am a little uneasy about not being covered if I am hit by an uninsured driver. The cost difference between the two products is substantial - over 20%.

I know there is a level of cover from the MIB for claims against uninsured drivers - does anyone know how this compares to having the cover on my own policy? Would I get a similar payout in the event if an accident?",2,1754892605.0,13,CartalkUK,1755027263,2025-08-11 06:10:05,2025-08-12 19:34:23,"blahblahscience1 (Score: 8): How much do you think a windscreen replacement would be for your car?

Many countries have a mandatory eye test to get your drivers license, and you then have to get your eyes tested on every renewal. Which is no bad thing

Compared to the UK where you get asked once at your test “can you read that number plate”

My grandad had three strokes, amazingly survived and is relatively ok but is still allowed to drive. He can't go three hours without a nap because he starts falling over, but can get behind the wheel and jump on the M1. I've seen him pull off my drive and it's fucking dangerous. 

He's way too stubborn to listen to any of the family, and honestly isn't there 100% cognitively anymore to understand for himself that he's a danger. 

His eyesight is perfect."

thescx (Score: 1): What gen Touareg are you looking at?

I’ve a first gen V6 petrol that gives me around 8-10mpg but on a good day with 40/50mph days, i’ll get 15-19mpg. 

I think the second gen was similar but the third gen had some improvement. 

Drive wise it’s amazing. Handles well and with the acoustic package, it’s very calm and quiet inside the car. 

Getting parts can be a bitch depending on which generation you go for and not on the cheap side, even with used parts. 

Overall, a great car. 

BTW, if you get the first gen with a digital amp, you can forget about upgrading the radio as the digital amp doesn’t play well with afternarket head units. Some have tried and I read one guy went to lengths of splicing wires and what not to get his 11 speakers to work with a headunit but sounds like too much hassle. Though you can get a bluetooth add on which gives a connection for calls and music through the speakers."

No it'll fail after X miles. You'll probably start getting a 'clonking' sound as it moves and dries out. 

However they are really easy to do yourself if you've got the time and effort. If so I'd do it as soon as possible as the more rust the harder it is to get off.  They'll cost about £15-20.

You jack the car up, wheel off. Pop a bit that fits into the centre of the ball joint, for me it is an allen key, but some can be torx. And find a socket / spanner / ring spanner to turn the rest of the of the nut. Repeat for top and bottom. Same to put the new ones on.

You might need to jack the control arm to lessen the pressure in my experience to get it to fall out.
