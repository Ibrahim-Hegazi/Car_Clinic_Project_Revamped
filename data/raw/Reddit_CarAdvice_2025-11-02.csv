1om2w5k,Looking to Extend Life of Engine for Winter: P0024 Code,"Hello,

I drive a Subaru. Over 10 years old. Took it in because it was throwing a P0024 code for camshaft position timing. The shop said fixing it would be more than it’s worth, and that it might have 6 mo. to a year left. 

I’m hoping to extend the life of the vehicle, at least through winter (-30). Would an engine flush or solenoid replacement help in this case? Any other ideas? 

It seems to start and run a bit rougher in the cold. The real concern is that it sometimes doesn’t accelerate quickly or well. That is hard to predict as well. I can see that being dangerous when entering traffic at high speeds. I commute to work on the highway.

Winter is around the corner. Normally, I would bite the bullet, but It isn’t a great time to buy a vehicle, and I’m going through a divorce. Any advice would be appreciated.

Replace or clean the AVCS solenoid on that bank

Check/clean the tiny banjo bolt filter if your engine has one

Consider a gentle flush before the oil change (Liqui-Moly/Seafoam)

Use a block heater + warm up in winter

These engines act exactly like you described when the AVCS is sticking. Doing this can easily buy time, sometimes a long time. If it starts knocking or losing power constantly, then reassess, but right now it's worth trying maintenance first."

I'm not sure if a knock sensor code indicates premature detonation or that the knock sensor has failed.

Engines are designed not to knock but these days, in order to get the most out of the fuel, they advance the timing as much as possible, short of triggering the knock sensor.  So if it has failed, there may be unknown consequences; either letting the engine knock (which will cause excess wear) or backing off the timing too much (which will decrease power and maybe increase fuel consumption).

None of these will cause instant catastrophic failure but it is probably worth finding out which it is."

1om1x6o,Help please,"So to start off this is a 2014 Hyundai Elantra limited. 
After parking it after running to the store car wouldn’t start the next morning. Would just try to crank and crank and crank
Changed spark plugs installed a new battery and the car still wouldn’t start.
So today I got  in the car and tried to start it, it would crank and crank and I felt like it wasn’t getting gas so I pumped the gas petal as it was cranking and got it to start but it sounded rough and instantly bogged out.
Made me suspect a fuel delivery issue, so I popped the fuel pump fuse out and tried starting the car to remove and gas in the line, then I popped the fuel line off the fuel valve? And tried cranking the car over to see if the fuel pump was working, and it was! Purged the line for a few seconds and reconnected and tried starting the car again because after I pulled the fuse and drained the gas by trying to crank the car it actually started and stalled due to no fuel pump fuse in the car to turn the fuel pump on. 
Now that I got everything back together the car starts and runs pretty good, you can slightly here the the idle go up and down when it’s sitting but it’s throwing codes that I took pictures of.
I want to be optimistic and still hope the o2 sensor is the issue, but for the car not to start prior to these codes make me think the injectors are an issue.

1om1sp6,Rear brake problem,"I have a 2005 Ford Explorer sport trac. I replaced the rear brake pads and saw that the pads on the driver side were completely gone, and the passenger side were only half gone. I replaced the pads anyways not thinking there was a problem. That was about two weeks ago. And now the pads on the driver side rear are once again, half gone and the wheels heat up really bad almost as if the brakes stay engaged while I’m driving. At first, I thought it was the caliper so I replaced the caliper and the brake hose on the driver rear, which was having the problem. That didn’t fix it though. So I thought maybe the caliper on the passenger side was stuck and it was causing the driver side to over work. So I replaced the caliper on the passenger side, but that didn’t work and there’s also a constant drag. It only seems to happen when the brakes get hot. When everything is cold and I start out it seems to work OK but then as I drive it more the drag starts.

 if you loosen the bleeder screw.. for a moment.. does the left rear  release..  indicating something is preventing the release of brake fluid pressure to the right rear..  

 text of operation

 
 Principles of Operation
	The ABS operates as follows:
  When the brakes are applied, brake fluid is forced from the master cylinder outlet ports to the HCU inlet ports. This pressure is transmitted through three normally open solenoid valves and three normally closed valves (2 valves per circuit, 1 normally open and 1 normally closed) and then through the outlet ports of the HCU to each wheel.
	
 If the ABS module senses a wheel(s) is decelerating at a rate greater than the vehicle, based on wheel speed sensor data, it closes the normally open solenoid valve for the circuit(s). This prevents any additional fluid from entering that circuit(s).

 The ABS module then looks at the wheel speed sensor data again from the affected wheel(s).

 If that wheel(s) is still decelerating at a greater rate than the entire vehicle, the normally closed solenoid valve is then opened to relieve pressure in the affected circuit(s).

 Once the affected wheel(s) returns to the corrected speed, the ABS module returns the valves to their normal operating conditions, allowing fluid to once again flow through the affected circuit(s).

 The ABS module monitors the electromechanical components of the system.

 A malfunction in the ABS will cause the ABS module to shut off or inhibit the system. However, normal power assisted braking remains.

 Malfunctions are indicated by a yellow ABS warning indicator in the instrument cluster.

 The ABS is self-monitoring. When the ignition switch is turned to the RUN position, the ABS module will carry out a preliminary self-check on the anti-lock electrical system indicated by a three-second illumination of the yellow ABS warning indicator in the instrument cluster.

 During vehicle operation, including normal and anti-lock braking, the ABS module monitors all electrical anti-lock functions and some hydraulic operations.

 Each time the vehicle is driven to approximately 32 km/h (20 mph), the ABS module turns on the pump motor for approximately one half second. At this time, a mechanical noise may be heard. This is a normal function of the self-check by the ABS module.

 Pedal pulsation coupled with noise while braking on loose gravel, bumps, wet or snowy roads is normal and indicates correct functioning of the vehicles ABS system.

#now that you are totally confused..  the Normally open solenoid is the Isolation solenoid.. it blocks flow in both directions when the abs system tells it to close because that wheel is locking up when braking.. the normally closed solenoid opens and the fluid is dumped into an accumulator bore with a piston and spring.. allowing the system to isolate and then start releasing brake pressure to get that wheel to start spinning again.. 

 you sound like the isolation valve is stuck closed or is being commanded closed.

 you should get a scan tool that reads B0000 codes C0000 codes and U0000 codes also..

 get a friend with the keys in your pocket and the engine off.. hold their foot to the floor that holds the throttle open while you clean around the outside of where the throttle blade closes.. the outside and front and back of the throttle blade also.. the carbon build up causes issues that reduce the amount of expected air flow around the throttle blade forcing the computer to try to open the idle air control valve farther than normal.. 

 vacuum leaks.. get in.. get the engine running . step on the brake pedal. use 70 to 100 pounds of pressure.. turn off the engine as you start counting..  how many seconds before you can feel the vacuum assist go away and the pedal start pushing upwards..  you could have a major vacuum leak caused by a failing power brake booster..

  if you have that problem..  you can with extreme care.. remove the valve core.. catching the gasoline with several shop towels. screwing on the adapter and the gauge hose. then testing the fuel pressure.. this time you can release the pressure by pushing the button.. do not lose the valve core.. 

i have worked on these for decades.. 
 
 the surging can be from incorrect base idle setting causing the throttle position sensor to send too much voltage to the computer..

I’m replacing the timing chain tensioner on my 2012 Honda CR-V (2.4L i-VTEC K24 engine), but the old one is stuck and won’t come out.

I’ve already removed the timing chain cover and both mounting bolts for the tensioner. The body of the tensioner is loose, but it’s stuck on the right side (toward the engine block).

There’s not much visual access, and I can’t really see or reach behind it well. I’ve tried rotating the crank slightly clockwise to relieve chain tension and spraying penetrating oil around the edges, but it’s still holding tight on that inner side.

So it seems like the fuel pump takes a few seconds to build up pressure maybe?   Or maybe it's a fuel filter thing that results in the same behavior?

1olsj04,330i Misfiring - Difficult to pinpoint cause,"Hi all,

Recently, my **2008 BMW 330i E92 (N53 engine)** has started misfiring. The misfire started under the following conditions: Spirited driving on some clear roads, the misfire started suddenly with no apparent prior problems leading up to it.

  
The misfire originally showed that it is only occurring in cylinder #2. After taking the engine apart, checking everything and cleaning everything, I am confident that the injector, coils and spark plugs are working properly. All injectors were replaced last year, as well as the coils and plugs this year.

  
After a load test, the car then gave me a misfire in Cylinder #1, #2 and #3. I believe that the specific Cylinder #2 misfire is a false-positive and the issue is not with the cylinders themselves. We have looked at DISA valves, intake manifold, under the rocker cover - essentially almost everything in the engine other than the camshaft and conrods. We have also checked the pressure inside cylinders, all cylinders are reading healthy at \~13.5 BAR (\~200psi).

  
I then tested the MAF - I ran the engine with the MAF plugged in and the rough idling and misfires started around a minute into the test.

  
I turned the car off, unplugged the MAF, cleared codes and started her up again. This time, the idle was a little smoother and there was not much RPM deviation other than what you would expect from an unplugged MAF.

  
We did a smoke test in-case we have a vacuum leak, but the test did not indicate any vacuum leaks.

  
Is the most likely issue the MAF? I ordered a new sensor that will be coming in the following week, however, I would still like to test what other possible issues it could be before the new MAF comes.

I have also looked at the fuel trims, the air/fuel mixture reads around -3% - -7% in bank 1 and between 15% - 20% in bank 2.

  
I also receive an OL-FAULT when driving with the MAF plugged in. I receive CL and OL-DRIVE with the MAF unplugged.

For context, my wipers kept blowing a fuse around 6 months ago. It was diagnosed as a faulty motor, and as I was quoted £900, I bought it myself and installed it. Until now, the fix worked great.

A week ago, the fuse blew again, so I replaced it and it continued working until a few days ago. It now blows around 10 seconds after putting a new one in.

I opened it up to have a look at the linkage, which seems to move fine when disconnected. As does the motor. I reconnected the linkage without the wipers and that also moves fine for an extended period of time.

I washed the screen with some white vinegar and warm water and gave the wipers a little clean. Again, they run fine when connected with the arms up, but as soon as I put them down onto the screen, the fuse blows.

The only thing I can think of is the rubber on the wipers being old and causing too much friction, but could that really cause enough drag to blow the fuse?

1olroe9,Received two different opinions from mechanics,"2013 Ford F150 3.5L V6 EcoBoost. Just over 90k miles. I've owned it since 2017, it had roughly 38k miles on it when I bought it. It has been a reliable truck til now, no major issues - whiny AC that I recharged a couple years ago, I do most regular maintenance myself.

I put it in my regular shop for what sounded like a squeaky belt, figuring it wouldn't be that big of a deal. My regular guy got back to me and basically told me that's the least of my problems, sent me these pictures of the underneath (Control arm, frame) and recommended I don't put any more money into it. He didn't charge me anything.

Thinking I was going to need to try to get rid of it and get a new truck, I went back to the guy I bought it from (family friend, broker who buys/sells cars for people and runs a shop himself) who had me bring it by to inspect it. At this time the plan was for him to check it out, let me know roughly what he thought he could get for it and talk next car.

His guys look at it and he takes me under it - he suggested the frame is fine, repairing the control arm would be step 1 and he doesn't see an issue replacing those parts. He also recommended swapping out the driveshaft connection causing lurching, it's a standard issue on 6 1/2' f150s that is easily replaced.

My issue is deciding whether to take my regular guys advice and just dump the car for a newer one, or trust that this repair is all that is needed and I'll be able to drive it for another 5-10 years. Torn and thinking of getting a 3rd opinion at this point - any advice? Red flags?

I don't want to dump thousands into a repair just to look like a fool for not taking mechanic #1s advice when the next thing comes up, but I also don't want to give up on it and have to spend far more buying a replacement if this will last another 100k miles.

1olog4x,Car runs rough at idle after alternator rebuild,"Hey everyone,
I recently had my alternator rebuilt (new voltage regulator, bearings and slip rings). Since then, my car runs really rough at idle whenever I turn on electrical consumers — headlights, blower, or especially when I turn the steering wheel (it has electric power steering).

The voltage reads around 13.5–14.0V at the battery, but the engine shakes and sounds awful when the steering or other loads kick in. Once I rev it a bit, it smooths out again.

Could this be caused by a bad voltage regulator, poor ground connection, or something else on the electrical side? The car was perfectly smooth before the alternator was rebuilt.

All 6 Brand new NGK wires and OEM Motorcraft plugs from Rockauto on about a month ago.

Now, overnight, my wife goes to leave and it's misfiring. After 1000 rpm's, I get a code 0316 (that there's a misfire in the first 1000 rpm's) and code 0302 (that it's cylinder 2).

This is repeatable and not intermittent, also didn't happen while driving. So I think, obviously coil pack, right?  But my young but very smart mechanic friend says that's unlikely for it to be the coil pack and only misfire on one cylinder - because there's 3 coils in the pack, and cylinder 2 shares one with cylinder 6, so that one should be throwing a code too if one of the 3 coils in the pack failed.  Is he right? Or can they go weird in other ways?

What are the chances I actually got a bad NGK wire or Motorcraft plug from Rockauto?  The problem is cylinder 2 is in the rear bank and inaccessable without removing the whole air intake plenum and a bunch of other stuff, which takes about an hour, and after I do that I can't run the car to test.

So what can I do to test the coil pack?  Pull a plug and wire from the front bank and plug it into cylinder 2 on the coil pack, see if it sparks?  Like I said the rear 3 wires and plugs are inaccessable for me.  But the coil pack is, slightly accessable.  It took my friend an hour to get all the shit off when he changed them, me, I don't even know if I can do it and remember how to put it back together.  

And if it's a bad plug or especially wire - can I get it covered by Rockauto?  Or can you just buy 1 plug wire local?  They all seem to come in sets and not cheap.

It getting to be Cyclone Rake season and I some how grenaded the Briggs 31P677 in my John Deere LA110

Since this thing is kitted out I just decided to  I swap the original engine in my LA110 for a Briggs & Stratton 33R877. The wiring is sorted and the starter engages fine, but it only spins the flywheel a few turns before stalling out — like it’s hitting a wall of compression.

If I pull the spark plug, the engine spins freely. With the plug in, the starter either slows way down or kicks back a bit, as if it’s fighting compression. I don’t think it’s firing yet but I did get a backfire once.

Here’s what I’ve checked so far:
	•	Valves visually look fine, though I haven’t measured lash yet.
	•	The battery is new and fully charged.
	•	Grounds and cables are clean and solid.
	•	With the plug out, starter cranks smooth and fast.
	•	When turning the flywheel by hand, I can feel it eventually “release” compression partway through the cycle.
      •     Tested the spark plug while connected and we are getting spark

From what I can tell, the compression release might be engaging too late or the starter isn’t strong enough to reach that point. 

I’m not 100% I’m drawing gas past the filter, but it sure smells like it’s every time I pull the plug

I’ve hit a wall and I just can’t let a lawn mower engine get the best of me. I’d love some advice from anyone who’s seen this with “newer” Intek engines.

Could this be a valve lash issue? Weak starter? Something mechanical with the compression release on the camshaft?

1olipjq,Finally got my car looked at. How bad is it?,"So I wrote a post around a month ago about my car having smoke coming out the back of it but only when I accelerate. But it doesn’t do it all the time. Car starts up fine. Drives fine. But then for like a spell of 10-15 minutes if I stop and then accelerate I get white smoke. But after 15ish minutes it stops. 

Also the car idles hard. Like it’s about to cut out on me. Then there is the acceleration. It kinda speeds up. Then stops and feels like it delays and then speeds up. Kinda like someone speaking and then pausing to think and then carries on talking. Weird way of explaining it but hey haha. 

Some people said it might be condensation. Others says it might be the head gasket. 

So I finally took it in to a garage and was actually shocked. So I’ve had the car since the 4th September. The service was done on the 23rd June. 

When I took the car in to garage. They said the car had no oil in it. They put a camera down and said oil was at the bottom. They also said my 3rd spark plug was burning. 

They put new oil in the car. My car is a 1 litre ford focus st line X 2021. It’s around 32000 miles and They told me it took 2.5 litres of oil to get the oil to the max line. 

I had someone yesterday come and collect the car because it’s still under warranty and he mentioned something to do with the wet belt. Also something to do with a seal might be broke. Then he checked the exhaust and put his finger in and found oil. 

I’ve been told it might need either an engine tear down or a brand new engine. Also they don’t know if it’s affected the turbo. 

My car got collected yesterday and is being looked at on Monday. 

Does anyone have a clearly feeling of what the issue is? And how long it might take? Will the fix it or just put a new engine on?

1olfdu3,2009 Toyota Corolla 1.8L Cold Start Rattle,"Hello All, I have a 2009 Toyota Corolla with 288k on it, for the past year it has been making a rattle on startup, however it is getting worse,  before it would be if it was the first start of the day but now even if it is sitting for an hour it will rattle, and then the other day I went to start it and it rattled for a second or so and then didn’t start, I finally got it to start after a few more try’s, once it’s running it’s fine.

So I took it to the mechanic and he thought it was the same thing I did, VVTI sprockets, which I see online is pretty common on these cars, however once the mechanic pulled the valve cover and started doing the work he said the sprockets were fine and didn’t need to be replaced, he said he thinks the rattle was called from slop in the timing chain hitting the top, he threw in a new tensioner and said it should be better and if it makes a little noise it’s okay. 

However it still makes the loud rattle noise, I most definitely thought it would be the VVTI Sprockets as the sound it makes matches a lot of videos I have found online. 

What do you guys thing? Do you think it could actually be the sprockets?  Or would the timing chain loose actually make this sound too? Is it worth to dig deeper and try to get the fixed? Even if it is the timing chain? Or should I just run it as it is? Main thing I’m worried about is grenading my engine

To me it looks/sounds like a loose connection or intermittent short somewhere. Probably on the positive side of the circuit since you said you checked grounds already. 


Defroster draws quite a bit of current, alternator responds by putting extra load on the engine and ECU adjusts accordingly. So the engine fluctuation is likely responding to fluctuation in the draw of the defroster circuit."

I recently had my check engine light come on, so I went to AutoZone to have the car scanned. They indicated the issue was with the thermostat.

I had the thermostat replaced at a local shop. After picking up the car, I drove less than three miles, and the power steering failed, requiring the car to be towed back to the shop.

The shop told me the issue was simply that the system needed to be bled better. However, 24 hours later, I lost all power steering again.

At one point, I was able to temporarily restore power steering by shutting the car off and immediately restarting it, but it only lasted briefly.

I ended up paying $130 to have the car towed 2.4 miles back to the same shop.

The shop maybe should have done this, but if it's only intermittently failing it might have been missed.

1olbdj9,2008 Mazda 3 window won't roll up.,"Noticed the other day my Front Passenger window wasn't rolling up. I gave the window pane a bit of a pull left and right, then it rolled up fine. It had a noticeable give, allowing it to rock towards the rear of the vehicle, so I assumed it wasn't seated correctly and had gotten slightly jammed, and that wiggling it freed it up to work correctly. 

Today, it was sitting about 1/3 of the way down, but wouldn't go back up. I searched for several solutions online, and here is where I am at:

\- I swapped the motor for the rear driver's side to check if it was the motor. Same issue. Rolled down fine, wouldn't roll up. 

\- Replaced the switch. Rolled down, but not up.

\- Using the driver's switch, it rolls down but not up. (I was only rolling it down slightly)

I eventually managed to slide it up by hand and secure it in place, reattached the motor, and left everything unplugged so hopefully it will stay there.

I ordered a replacement for the switch panel of the driver's door because I found a post mentioning that as a potential problem, and I found a new one for about $20 online. 

3 of my 4 widows have problems. The rear driver's is fine. The rear passenger's works fine, but the window pane isn't secure, so the motor moves up and down, but I have to push the actual pane of glass down. The driver's window works, but there is a connection problem with the switch; I have to push/pull really hard to get it to activate. I am hoping a new driver's switch panel will fix everything (other than the detached window pane) because of a post I found mentioning a control circuit being in that part, but if the front passenger still won't roll up, what should my next step be to try?",1,1761959100.0,3,CarTalk,1762111939,2025-11-01 01:05:00,2025-11-02 19:32:19,buttlicker-6652 (Score: 1): Your window regulator is bad.

I like to put it this way - Huge companies like those that design cars are profit horny.  If they could save even $1 per wheel per car by using 4 lugs instead of 5, they would.  $4 per car over half a million cars per year is a $2 million savings.  Companies don't spend two million bucks unless the engineers insisted that the lawsuits from wheels falling off would cost more than the savings, thus it is not safe to drive with less than 5.  Torqueing them correctly is also super important.  Too loose and they can work off the stud, too tight and the stud can snap (like those two appear to have).

1om2rhu,Car died.. then undied??,"Okay, so I’m convinced my dad and I could’ve literally died just now. We were on the highway going maybe 40 mph when the brakes just completely gave out. My dad handled it like a champ — slowed us down as much as he could and threw on the hazards — but since it was a construction zone, we couldn’t pull over to the shoulder.

Thankfully traffic was just clearing up, so it wasn’t super congested, and we were on a slight incline which helped us slow down faster. Then things got really weird.

After he turned the hazards on, the car started dinging, and I noticed the low gas light had popped up — even though he had literally just filled the tank an hour ago. I checked the gas gauge and it was going absolutely crazy — like full, empty, full, empty, back and forth super fast.

Then the car dinged again, the battery light came on, and we basically lost all power. The brakes still weren’t working, and the car just coasted to a stop in the left lane.

We sat there for a second like, “What just happened?” Then my dad turned the car off, instantly turned it back on, and… it just started up and drove perfectly fine again. We’ve been back on the road for over an hour now, no issues. It’s running totally normal like nothing happened.

So… what on earth was that?

Details:
•	2007 PT Cruiser
•	Bought used from a lot about a year ago
•	Check engine light has been on and off for a couple months, but stayed on since the incident happened.
•	Gas gauge doesn’t work (stuck on full, he uses the trip odometer instead)
•	He said this same thing happened once before
•	When we started the car earlier (about 20 min before it happened), the tailgate warning light was on — he says that happens sometimes because the tailgate doesn’t always latch right

I have a 2020 Nissan Altima SV with a 2.5L DOHC engine. A few months ago, I pushed the button and it tried to start and then just didn’t. The battery is brand new, but it seemed like a battery issue. I jumped it and it started right up.

The problem is intermittent. It very rarely happens if the car has sat all day at work or over night, but if I take a quick ride to the store, when I come out… it will try to start and then fails. I bought a jump starter and without fail, 2 seconds and it’ll start right up.

I’m kind of at a loss as to what it could be. I don’t think it’s the battery or the alternator, it’s obviously not the starter, I have no clue.

Sometimes it’ll be 2-3 weeks and no incidents, sometimes it’ll be nearly every time I try to start it for 3 days straight. Then it’ll be fine for a few days. Rinse and repeat.

It always starts immediately when I put the jump starter on… but when it fails starting it’s like the battery was dead - the mpg and trip tracker reset, occasionally the clock resets.. there seems to be no rhyme nor reason to it.

When I jump it, I’ll occasionally get a “key error” on the display. But that goes away when I start it the next time.

Whoever was the mechanical engineer at Chrysler who designed the engine was top notch. It's the easiest engine I've ever worked on. But the electrical engineer?🖕🤣. Whoever decided to integrate a fuel pump relay within a circuit board that can't be replaced is an AH. 

This problem would cost an unknowing customer 1000's because the dealership or joeschmoe mechanic would replace the entire fuse box(TIPM) just for a single relay.

1olkhzw,Finally got my car looked at. How bad is it?,"So I wrote a post around a month ago about my car having smoke coming out the back of it but only when I accelerate. But it doesn’t do it all the time. Car starts up fine. Drives fine. But then for like a spell of 10-15 minutes if I stop and then accelerate I get white smoke. But after 15ish minutes it stops. 

Also the car idles hard. Like it’s about to cut out on me. Then there is the acceleration. It kinda speeds up. Then stops and feels like it delays and then speeds up. Kinda like someone speaking and then pausing to think and then carries on talking. Weird way of explaining it but hey haha. 

Some people said it might be condensation. Others says it might be the head gasket. 

So I finally took it in to a garage and was actually shocked. So I’ve had the car since the 4th September. The service was done on the 23rd June. 

When I took the car in to garage. They said the car had no oil in it. They put a camera down and said oil was at the bottom. They also said my 3rd spark plug was burning. 

They put new oil in the car. My car is a 1 litre ford focus st line X 2021. It’s around 32000 miles and They told me it took 2.5 litres of oil to get the oil to the max line. 

I had someone yesterday come and collect the car because it’s still under warranty and he mentioned something to do with the wet belt. Also something to do with a seal might be broke. Then he checked the exhaust and put his finger in and found oil. 

I’ve been told it might need either an engine tear down or a brand new engine. Also they don’t know if it’s affected the turbo. 

My car got collected yesterday and is being looked at on Monday. 

Does anyone have a clearly feeling of what the issue is? And how long it might take? Will the fix it or just put a new engine on?

The mechanic i spoke to yesterday said they might just put a new engine in it.

It’s such a shame because I really liked this car. Only had it for a couple of months.

I would really appreciate your assistance thinking this through.

Of course, I am concerned that the car has a lot of ware: engine, transmission, breaks, seats, ?__?. On the other hand, I am thinking that the majority of the miles are highway miles which are supposed to be better than stop and go city miles. Also, a lot of the car is only two years old. 

It is complicated by the fact that the car is being sold by a dealership. So, I can not get reliable info on how the care was used. The CarFax info for this car is extremely limited. Limited oil changes. No mention of fluid changes: transmission, axle, coolant. I am *guessing* that with approx ten thousand miles a month there should have be several services a year. 

I am also trying to think through what things I would ask someone doing a pre-sale inspection to pay especially close attention to. 

If I bought this car I would want to hold on to it for as long as possible. We have  generally driven less than ten thousand miles a year. Not sure what the next five years will be like. 

As I said, I am inexperienced. I have done some reading on the net. At this point I would very much appreciate the input of some experienced mechanics. Thanks in advance for any input

1om15rr,Diagnostic code P0016,"Hi everyone,

I recently had a coolant leak repaired, but shortly after getting my car back, the check engine light came on. I took it back to the garage, and they cleared the code, saying it was a minor, common system fault that shouldn’t return. However, the light came back the next day.

The mechanic now suspects the camshaft sensor needs replacing instead of crankshaft as I don’t have any issues driving the car or starting it, but I’m a bit concerned it could be timing chain–related—though I haven’t noticed any symptoms that point to that, and the mechanic also said everything looks fine. I’ve attached a photo of the fault code and the note.

From what I’ve read, this issue can sometimes be caused by a failing camshaft or crankshaft sensor if the timing chain isn’t the culprit. I just want to make sure before spending money on the wrong part. Also, I’d like to know if it’s safe to keep driving for a month or two before replacing the sensor, or if it’s something that should be fixed as soon as possible.

Honestly, that sounds like a low-voltage or bad-ground issue, not a bunch of separate problems. Big clue here is you are getting codes for a bunch of unrelated sensors and transmission issues and it’s unlikely everything is failing all at once. Your car has 3 main grounds (battery-to-chassis, battery-to-engine, and engine-to-transmission). If one’s loose or corroded, it’ll cause loss of power, no speedo, and random “circuit low” codes.

I live in Texas, where weather can be labile. Two years ago when we had a week of freezing temperature, my truck’s battery ended up needing several jumps, charging, and eventual replacement by the dealership since they said my alternator and starter to were functioning fine. Replaced it with an ACDelco battery. 

My truck has been running perfectly fine over the past 2 years. In the past couple days, the temps have dipped down to ~40 degrees Fahrenheit. Not very cold, but my battery started to have issues again. Started it okay this morning, went to the gym for only 1 hour, and came back to a truck with a dead battery. Jumped it and had it checked out and replaced by the dealer since they’re honoring the 42 month replacement by ACDelco. Again, the starter and alternator are fine.

I’ve had my dashcam unplugged, kept off interior lights, and made sure nothing is plugged in anywhere in my truck. Any thoughts on what could be causing this battery drain when temperatures decline?

I replaced the pushrods, double checked rocker arms timing etc, and spun the engine a lot to make sure everything worked well.   It all moved like it was supposed to.

Noticing a trend I didn't continue to test every cylinder.  

  
My guess at this point is incorrect timing.  I replaced the timing chain, phaser and crankshaft gear.  Maybe they suck and I should put the old ones back on?  I just don't see how I could have gotten the timing wrong.  I put it at 12 (phaser) and 6 (crankshaft), made marks on the gears and did multiple rotations and they always came back to the same place.  But zero compression everywhere?  Is there a valve train issue or a timing issue where the valves are just opening up the whole time on the compression stroke..everywhere?   That must be timing, right?

Is this a scenario which happens all the time? Or very unlikely? 

I don’t know if my car’s cooling system has air trapped or I effed it. I replaced the coolant after opening upper radiator and cylinder head hose. I bled it using BMW auto bleed procedure and on the drive after (~1 hour) the car did not overheat and the heat inside the cabin worked fine (it was cold with cold engine, shortly after started to warm up and as engine/coolant was hot, it was blowing hot). 

Now I hear a sloshing noise behind the dash when initially starting heat/engine on a hot engine. I have bled the thing 8 times! And it still results in what I think is air inside the system because the coolant level is higher the next day when cold. This also started happening 2 days after the work I did. So I don’t know if there was initially air trapped which didn’t get bled out and I went full throttle after engine was proper hot to check it was all working well. I did this 30mins into the first drive after making sure temperature was stable. Maybe I effed the head gasket on max power. There’s no overheating codes or anything. I did overfill the coolant initially just a tiny bit in case there was air left in the system then there was extra coolant to make up for it. I don’t think I’m losing coolant. There’s no white smoke from exhaust. So if the head gasket is damaged, it’s damaged in a way where combustion gas is getting into the water jacket only. Water is not getting into oil or cylinders.

SippsMccree (Score: 1): So in regards to the DPF there are two methods in which it can regenerate. If you take longer drives it will just do it passively while cruising at highway speeds. If it will be a case of shorter drives it will need to perform parked active regenerations. The latter requires the vehicle to intentionally raise exhaust temperatures (usually via an extra fuel injector upstream of the filter) in order to properly catalyze the built up soot in the filter. For you I would say the gasoline model would probably be better especially because if it's a lot of short trips the fuel economy advantages of diesel arent really being actualized and they're mechanically more complicated (and expensive) than gas.

I’m not familiar with this exact car but from my experience with other manufacturers using EPS, if I were to guess the problem I’d say your electric rack and pinion might be failing and will probably require replacement."

Since the ABS module was already swapped, I'd focus on the wheel speed sensors themselves. With these vehicles, a single faulty sensor or a sensor that's out of spec during turns (buildup, debris, gap issues) can cause the ESC to go haywire.



Before throwing more parts at it, get someone to pull the actual fault codes from the ESC/stability control module—not just clear the ABS light. There's diagnostic info there that'll point to which sensor is causing the issue.



Also worth checking: tire pressure (uneven pressure can cause speed variances the sensors pick up) and wheel alignment. Worn wheel bearings too—they can gradually mess with sensor readings.



The fact that it only happens while turning is the key. Your sensors are reading wheel speeds differently than they should during cornering, triggering an emergency braking intervention. It's almost certainly either a sensor reading wrong or the module expecting data in a specific range it's not getting.



Get the codes pulled first—that's your roadmap."

That’s the answer. 

But fair warning, if your stuff is in rough/neglected condition they’ll probably tell you that needs a ton of work before it can be aligned. 

And, like brakes, best practices call for equivalent parts to be replaced in pairs on both side of the vehicle at the same time to ensure even wear over time. So if that lower control arm had a shiny new ball joint in it… you should really get the other side done as a precaution.

Fieroboom (Score: 1): It sounds like your front tires have a little too much toe-in, but before you get an alignment, you need to have all of the connections on the other side closely inspected for wear/play, such as the control arm bushings, tie rod ends, and balljoint.

I did a bit more research and found that a TC automatic transmission doesn't have engine braking and the brakes have to do all the work which leads to hear build up.

1olczn0,"Vibrating steering wheel after getting new tires, balance and alignments.","TLDR: I got new tires from a dealership a few months ago. My steering wheel vibrates (mostly around 60-70 mph) even though I’ve had multiple balances and alignments. 


Full story: I have a 2022 Hyundai sonata SEL plus. Bought it brand new around Sept 2021. In April of those year I had around 38k miles, I knew I needed tires soon. I backed out of my driveway and drove 20 feet before realizing a tire was flat. Called a few shops and eventually set on a Dobbs tire shop and got Continental Extreme Contact tires (idk much about cars I’m sorry). Got the tires on a Tuesday and they said I needed to come back Thursday for an alignment. I got an alignment and noticed that the wheel was shaking sometimes but couldn’t pin point exactly when. I noticed it a lot more and took it back thinking it was an alignment issues, they checked the alignment and said there was no issue. Called them multiple times, they agreed to rebalance them and realized one of the tires was an ounce off. Got the car back and it wasn’t perfect but I didn’t care enough to fight them again, just decided I’ll go to a different location when I was due for a balance. Fast forward  few months later I got a new balance at a different location and ran into the same issue. I decided to pay it the dealership to an alignment and balance because I’ve had them do it multiple times before and never had issue. It got a lot better but I still feel the wheel vibrating. Throughout the months I realized it happens mostly during highway speeds of 60-70mph, and less but still noticeable vibrations at +/- 10 mph.  I took it to a 3rd mechanic shop who did a full inspection and test drive, they lowered the tire pressure (from 37 to 33. Did make the drive feel better and smoother) and mentioned that he did feel some weird vibrations when the lane keep assist feature was pulling the car to the middle of the lane (I don’t remember there ever being vibrations since I bought the car and before I got the new tires). He didn’t notice any issues to the tires, control arms, ball joints or anything tbh. He recommended that I take it back to dealership and check the steering angle sensor. Took it back to the dealership, they said they did a test drive and didn’t notice anything weird or abnormal and said that’s how the feature is supposed to work. I asked them to an alignment and again it felt better but still notice the vibration. I’m at around 45k miles now, and now have had 2 alignments and 4 tire balances done since I got the tires and still have these vibrations. I would have attached a video but it’s hard to capture on camera. I don’t really know what to do, I’ve driven on the same road for a few years with this car so I was used to which roads had vibrations etc. I don’t really know what to do from here, any suggestions would be helpful. I tried to include as much info as I can but please let me know if there is more info I can include.

Sound after return from dealer - https://youtu.be/1J_sDfbIIyA?si=YmFavV2jspDxWMyb


Hello all, first time post. Anyone know if the sounds in the videos are normal 6.2L noises or should I be worried? I just got my truck back from the dealer. They had it for 4 days after waiting 8 weeks for the appointment.

The truck is a 2025 Sierra 1500 AT4X with the 6.2L and I started hearing a tapping noise that rises and falls with engine rpm around 3000 miles, the truck currently has 4900 miles. The truck also has a slight irregular idle that seems to come and go. When it’s there you can feel it in your seat and see vibrations if a water bottle is sitting in the center console. I remember the fuel pump tick from day one, I don’t recall hearing any sounds that rise and fall with the rpm and no performance issues so far. The video is a black screen because my phone is laying on the drivers side front tire.

They said they cannot see or reproduce the irregular idle and the noise is normal. Quote from the work order says “no problem found noise heard is normal for 6.2 when compared to like unit”.

When I picked it up they said a few things that confused me. First, the noise was normal and “if it was a valve train problem it throws a code every time and there’s no code”.  They followed up with “at worst you have the beginning of an exhaust leak” but declined to say why they didn’t investigate a possible exhaust leak.

They finished with saying if it gets more pronounced to bring it back and that I have a lot of warranty left. If what gets more pronounced? They just finished telling me they compared it to a new truck on the lot and everything sounds normal.

Sorry for the long post but what do you all think? Normal noise or do they just not want to investigate further? Or are they saying, not big enough of an issue, wait until it leaves you stranded and bring it back?",1,1761958790.0,3,AskMechanics,1762111939,2025-11-01 00:59:50,2025-11-02 19:32:19,heartlandthunder (Score: 1): Drive it hard till the engine blows and get a new one

1olagtn,Anyone else use ChatGPT to help diag?,"I’ve been working as an automotive technician for almost 10 years now, and recently I’ve started using ChatGPT to help with certain parts of the job.  I haven't taken the time to study up on ASE certifications and I'm actually back in school to get my Bachelor's in a field completely unrelated to automotive.  I know it’s not a replacement for a scan tool, wiring diagram, or ALLDATA, but it’s become a surprisingly handy resource in the shop.

When I get a code or issue I’m not fully familiar with — something like P1453 or P0421, for example — I’ll ask ChatGPT to explain the system operation, what sensors are involved, and what kind of conditions trigger the fault. It helps me get a quick overview before I start diving into diagnostics. Sometimes it even gives me a different angle to approach a problem, especially when I’ve been staring at the same issue for too long.

My diagnostic times have greatly improved and I've been feeling a lot more confident in my work since using it as a tool. As someone with ADHD that tends to jump from one theory to another, I feel that it has helped me stay planted. I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and it has me questioning everything.

I’ve also used it to brush up on system theory or refresh old knowledge — like EVAP, variable valve timing, or turbo control systems. It’s kind of like having a really patient assistant who doesn’t mind explaining things twice. Of course, I still double-check everything with verified sources, but it’s great for bouncing ideas around or narrowing down possibilities. It definitely replaces asking the 30-year tech who does nothing but be grumpy and yell.

I’m curious — are any other techs using ChatGPT or other AI tools in your workflow? Do you find it helpful for research, training new techs, or diagnostics?

Only one person actually bothered to look up the specific application and respond that the only fix was an entirely new valve cover.


For that model year Altima, the valve cover gasket only traces the perimeter, and the tube seals are integrated into the cover (and non-serviceable). The cover itself is also plastic and is known to warp, so sometimes it's not even the seals that were the problem anyway. In either case, the only option is replacing the valve cover. But almost every commenter just went with the general context clues without truly understanding what was occurring.

Backstory: - 2 weeks ago a third party “clipped” the front OS corner of my car while parked. They’ve turned off left details and we went through insurance based off of parts cost. 

I received my car back after being fixed by a repair shop used by my insurer. 5 Star defacto and top rated UK car insurer. I only had time for a quick hand over due to being in a meeting. 

I’ve since noticed that they have used non genuine parts (I know insurers do this) but the replacement lacks the BMW logo on the light and emits a different colour

They haven’t repaired correctly as the OS headlight points to the ground a few metres in front of the car and has an obvious gap against the bumper, they’ve fitted the reg plate incorrectly, wonky and lacking fixings, fixings under the bonet for trim are missing and a panel damaged and parking sensors are not fitted to the bumper correctly. 

They also seem to have coded out the auto shippable headlight feature as it no longer works at all, no warning message or function from it at all.

1olp8k7,Having a nightmare dealing with Mercedes service centre for NOx sensor issue recall (C Class 250d),"I own a Mercedes C Class C250d 64 plate (98k miles on clock) and over the last couple months I have been dealing with a NOx sensor issue (not uncommon in these cars) which essentially has now crippled my car due to the Adblue countdown (""engine wont start in X miles"") not going away because the NOx sensors are faulty. The replacement of these sensors should have been covered under the [recall](https://group.mercedes-benz.com/innovation/drive-systems/diesel/recalls-overview.html) which my car was taken in under by Marshall Mercedes, however they are refusing to carry out the replacement due to the sensor issue being down to ""wear and tear"" and not a manufacturer defect, which there is no mention of this distinction on the recall page. Instead, they are quoting £2.1k to fix, which is 25% the market value of my vehicle.

I'm currently engaging with Mercedes directly over this who are discussing the case with Marshall as to their reasoning behind not completing the recall as full, but I was hoping to get other's advice on this who may have been in a similar scenario.

Full timeline of events for context (sent to Mercedes and AI generated for clarity)

* The engine management light (EML) began appearing intermittently on my dashboard.
* I took the vehicle to an independent garage, where a diagnostic check confirmed electrical faults related to the NOx sensors.
* A friend later informed me that Mercedes-Benz had issued a NOx sensor recall (detailed [here](https://group.mercedes-benz.com/innovation/drive-systems/diesel/recalls-overview.html)).
* I contacted Mercedes-Benz directly, who confirmed my vehicle was eligible and booked me into Marshall Mercedes-Benz.
* I dropped off the vehicle for the recall work. At that time, the EML was not illuminated (due to its intermittent nature), but the underlying fault still existed.
* When I collected the car, the dealership advised that no faults were found with the NOx sensors and that only a software update had been performed.
* When I questioned why the sensors were not replaced despite the known fault codes, I was told the EML could have been a “false flag” and that the software update should resolve it.
* The invoice they provided incorrectly lists the NOx sensors as replaced in the jobs completed (costing £0.00), even though this was not done. I believe this may have been printed to suggest the recall was fully completed when it wasn’t.
* They also charged me £25 to fill the Adblue tank up since during the service the low Adblue warning light came on (it had not come on in the 2 years prior), this was despite the recall service being free of charge
* Ten days later, the EML reappeared—this time along with a **low AdBlue warning** stating the engine would not start in 452 miles.
* I immediately contacted Marshall Mercedes-Benz by email. After several exchanges, they agreed to carry out a **complimentary diagnostic test** to investigate both the EML and AdBlue warnings.
* Following the diagnostic test, I was informed that both the upstream and downstream NOx sensors were faulty and required replacement.
* I was quoted **£2,142.24** for the work.
* When I asked why this wasn’t covered under the recall, they claimed the issue was due to “wear and tear” rather than a manufacturer defect. However, they were unable to provide any technical evidence to support this conclusion.
* The recall information on the MB website makes no mention of excluding wear and tear faults, nor was this distinction explained to me prior to or during the recall appointment.
* I believe Marshall Mercedes-Benz failed to carry out the recall correctly and are now attempting to charge me for work that should have been covered under it. The NOx sensor fault existed prior to the recall and persisted immediately afterwards, suggesting that the underlying issue was not properly addressed.",1,1762007380.0,2,CartalkUK,1762111939,2025-11-01 14:29:40,2025-11-02 19:32:19,"therealharbinger (Score: 1): Nox sensors fail on these Mercs all the time.

There was an issue with a tyre pressure sensor, so I took it to my local MG dealership to get fixed, and the online dealer refunded me for it. As part of the job, MG did a ""health check"", which highlighted that ""NSF and OSF bottom arm rear bushes starting to separate"", quoting £655 to fix this. See pictures I extracted from the inspection video, I'm not a car expert and I can't really interpret them. They said this is ""advisory"", and while they quoted for the job, they also said it is not immediately urgent, to keep an eye, and check in the next service.

Is this a genuine issue or are they trying to charge me for an unnecessary job? The car is a few months out of warranty for this. I tried asking the online dealer that sold me the car if they would cover, but they stated:

""This car passed our inspections and all relevant components, including the rear arm bushes, were checked. The vehicle would never have left us if it wasn’t in a safe and great condition. The video from MG do not show anything currently wrong with the bushes. At this stage, it’s purely an advisory, and the car is safe to drive. They recommend monitoring the condition during regular servicing just to ensure everything remains in order. It’s also worth noting that a lot of the time, main dealers may suggest additional work, particularly on items not covered under warranty. However, as the video states, there is no current issue and the car is fine.""

Look at the general condition of the car, exterior for scratches and dents, interior for tidiness (you want to get your moneys worth) and ALL secondary controls work.

1olnoa7,Awful experience with Motorway (sell your car),"Hi I had 4 mafia gang member type people come to my house and try and buy my car after arranging collection with the buyer. 

I say mafia - big, bullish and typical salesman tactics . They weren't the buyer, they were the transport company on behalf of the buyer. No flexibility, ""it's today or never"" !

One kept saying the manager will call you when it was clearly his family member calling from another parked car near by. 

One kept saying car had engine faults & clutch issues including hydraulic issues, all by lifting up the bonnet and offered to take £1500 off sale price. 

It's clear the transport company and the buyer (dealer) were in on the scam or whatever this was, they were trying to rinse me of the sale value.

The broker (Motorway) don't give two shits. In the end they left without the car. 

They even offered for me to leave the key in the car unlocked so they can come and inspect with an easy experience without me being present 🤦‍♂️

I will be going to Dealerships (chains) or franchised dealers in the future and will take an even heavier loss in sale value vs a private / broker sale.

From what I could see, it was just him having a laugh with someone with heavy use of ‘🤣🤣🤣’ emojis. Anyway, 10 minutes later tells me the car has the following wrong with it. 

- Front Camera inactive 

- ABS pump failure 

- Some sort of electrical fault, but he said whatever it was, is common and don’t worry about it. 

The car was an A6, it doesn’t have a front camera, only rear. So he said ‘that’s strange’. I questioned, if it does indeed have a pump failure, wouldn’t it show on the digital dash? He said, ‘na it wouldn’t’. 

He then asked for a test drive, didn’t put his belt on. So the car started screaming at him, after 5 minutes he said ‘annoying init, these beeps’, then puts his belt on. Car was fine, returned back. Said ‘my manager will call you’, which he did. The manager said ‘the ABS pump failure is a £2k fix, and because of that, we no longer want the car’, and that was that. The guy fucked off, and I went back in the house. 

Spoke with Audi direct, as I had a manufactures warranty still with them, they said an ABS pump failure would indeed show on the dash, but bring it in incase, this was then further confirmed there was no fault, through diagnostics.

After much difficulty I managed to get the advisor on the phone for an explanation and found out the situation is even more frustrating than I imagined.

I've come across a i20 2022 plate with 24k miles for £13.2k, but it is the SE Connect trim (lowest trim in the range, so no heated seat belts, heated steering wheel, armrest etc). The same dealership has now added another i20 in their stock which is also a 2022 plate with 33k miles for £13.5k - but this car is the premium spec so does include the heated seats, steering wheel and armrest alongside a few additional other features. The only thing I've seen with this premium car is that when I've checked the MOT on Gov website it states that the car may have an outstanding recall. Whereas the slightly cheaper option car (£13.2k) states there are no recalls. Obviously I don't know what exactly the recall for the other car is so can only presume the recall is for cars on the premium and higher specs - but my question is, is it risky to be buying a car that has a recall and is it for me to sort out or the dealership to fix with the manufacturer before selling? To note this dealership is a local car dealership and not an approved used sort. Any help and advise please as I am a first time car buyer (note I know ppl will think this is expensive for a first car but I'm in my late 20s - I don't want to be buying a 10 year old car that has a lot of mileage).

Don't necessarily buy into the small engine = cheap insurance. 

If you can add a parent/s or someone else that's been driving a long time as a named driver. Make sure your parking arrangements are recorded accurately and don't automatically assume parking in a garage will be cheaper because it isn't always.

Also the best bit of insurance advice is don't be a muppet in your first car. if you crash it and it results in a claim then you can kiss any semblance of cheap insurance goodbye until you are 30.

1oljtmk,Buying advice on mid 20-teens mercs.,Im currently in the market for an estate. I keep coming across these 2013-2017 mercs for very good value. 4k-6k for an estate that cost much much more than that brand new. I find myself looking at them longer than the other prospective buys but I can't help but feel im missing something. Barring a clean MOT/service history is there a reason these are super cheap? Is it a billion pounds for wiperblades? Does it require a monthly subscription? Please save me from this financial mistake im desperately trying to make.,2,1761990398.0,14,CartalkUK,1762111939,2025-11-01 09:46:38,2025-11-02 19:32:19,"Nervous_Difficulty_6 (Score: 15): Just had a quick look on Autotrader. You’ll be looking at 150k+ miles, for a boggo spec C class estate. If it’s a diesel, it will go forever if it’s maintained well. But really, I wouldn’t say these are ‘good value’. It’s literally just a high mileage, base spec 11 year old Mercedes.

ketamineandkebabs (Score: 6): Is it a diesel you are after? If so the sensible choice is the 2.1 the fun choice is the 3.0. The 3.0 is a great engine but if you are on a budget they aren't very fuel efficient around the town. Also if something does go wrong with it for example the oil cooler leaks (which can be a common thing) it's buried in the V and is an expensive fix thanks to the labour cost.

The 2.1 is fairly built proof and has enough power to be nice to drive. If you are anywhere near a low emission zone look for a bluetec, you get a C250 bluetec but for the E class they only went for the E220.

Get a nice spec one with all the toys, I have a 2014 E350 AMG sport and it's a lovely thing to be in, it has the Harmon Kardon stereo which was the clincher for me. 

And yes parts are shocking prices, mines has a DLR bulb out turns out you have 3 options, 1 new headlight at £700+, 2 take the headlight out send it away to get cut open which is around £300 or 3 live with the warning pop up all the time. I went for 3 as it's pre 2018 it doesn't need it for a MOT. 

Servicing costs are also more expensive, find an indy specialist don't take it to Merc lol. I do my own so couldn't comment on prices"
1oljl6m,Which one is better?,"Hey guys,
I am after a Toyota Yaris and I have found two options which I am interested in:

1 - Toyota Yaris Icon Hatchback
1.5 VVT-h Icon E-CVT Euro 6 (s/s) 5dr 
Approved Used - £14,650 - 2021 - 29,563 miles - 2 owners - full dealership history 

2 - Toyota Yaris Icon Hatchback
1.5 VVT-h Icon E-CVT Euro 6 (s/s) 5dr
Autotrader dealership - £13,399 - 2022 (71 reg) - 45,501 miles - full service history 

One is more expensive and older but it is an approved used with less miles, the other is cheaper and newer but has more miles and it is not an approved used.

Which one you think is worth it?",1,1761989476.0,2,CartalkUK,1762111939,2025-11-01 09:31:16,2025-11-02 19:32:19,"Prolapse94 (Score: 1): Hard to say, but approved used often offers 1 year warranty for free which is worth considering

Fearless_Ad_3319 (Score: 1): Probably better to go for dealer approved, unless there are different options / features between the newer/ older car.

You can get a warranty extension every year you get it serviced by Toyota up to 100k miles or 10 years old.

To be fair you can do the same for the other car but there is a risk they will identify  work that needs doing at that first service."
