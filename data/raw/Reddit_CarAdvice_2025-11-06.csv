But I also work on cars and know what to look for, I'm aware not everyone could feel confident in that.

If the cat is plugged and causing it to run poorly, yeah try pouring that cataclean stuff in the tank. I have no experience with it but it's cheap enough (only like $20-30 looking it up) so screw it. If it's just a code and it runs fine, I'd still poor it in. Cats also go bad for a reason. 

I'd probably just keep driving it till the wheels fall off. If it absolutely needs a cat because it runs poorly (and you don't live in a state that checks emissions), I'd just get a cheap $80 cat off amazon and have some cheaper shop throw it in for you. 

Outer tie rods and to less of an extent, sway bar links are safety items. I'd get a quote for just those and see how bad they actually are. Belt yeah I'd do and it should be cheap enough. 

Power steering leak fix... depends on cost, how bad the leak is, and if it's leaking onto the alternator or something. Engine torque mount should be pretty cheap, and excess movement of engine does wear other parts. Spark plugs eh I'm sure it needs it but not strictly necessary in terms of driving till the wheels fall off as long as its not actively misfiring. At the same time they're cheap and take less than 5 minutes to do but idk what they're charging you. By tps sensor do you mean throttle position or tire? tire sensors are up to you but you can definitely live without one working.

throttle cleaning and fuel induction services are very upselly, not in the best interest of this car's current purpose for you. Honestly from the services recommended, and how outrageously expensive it is, it seems like they're just hitting you with the books. Dealership I assume. 

I would find a reputable independent mechanic (not a chain shop or something), and get a second opinion. Express what you're thinking about determining if it's worth putting money into, and bring up what dealer recommended along with what I said here about how much is really necessary to keep car running safely for now.

Hey everyone,

I’ve been trying to track down a front-end noise that I can’t seem to solve. I already replaced the front driver-side hub assembly, but the grinding and intermittent thudding are still there. I’m down about $170 and hoping to avoid throwing more money at parts that don’t fix it.

Here’s what I’ve done so far:
	•	Checked all suspension components (tie rods, control arms, sway bar links, etc.) — all feel tight.
	•	The drive axle has minimal in-and-out movement and feels secure.
	•	The rotor hasn’t been replaced yet.
	•	This started after a highway incident where I had to replace a component on that corner, and since then, the issue has gradually worsened.
	•	The noise happens mostly when steering to the left and fades when steering to the right.

I’ve uploaded a short video of the front corner assembly so you can see and hear what’s happening. Hoping someone might catch what I’ve missed.

First time with non-greaseable joints and haven’t done one at all for years. I didn’t monitor which cap came from which side and now learn I should, due to precise amounts of grease inserted at the factory. I used the press and impact to install, probably shouldn’t. 

Pressing back and forth, squeezing some grease out of one side (not shown in photo), I can get some decent movement in the joint but not buttery. Seems risky to think driving it will center it up and balance.

Nissan maxima 2016.
Battery light flickers, usually when driving in stand still traffic.


What could the charging issue be? 2 mechanics have changed alternators but end results are the same, battery light flickers and eventually car dies. 

Been having this issue with the battery light flicking the last 2 months only recently it started flickering more.

2 weeks ago  I dropped it off at a shop they replaced the alternator (remanufactured Ultima), everything was fine for about a week then I noticed squealing when I turn the steering wheel for the first time after starting up in cold weathers or after I go in reverse and drive off it squeals. So they replaced the serpentine belt 4 days ago, weather hasn't been cold lately so can't really say if that fixed the squealing.....

Then 2 days ago battery light starts flickering again so I had Orielly test it out, they said battery not charging, so I bought a new battery, then test results says battery is good but not charging enough. Went back to the mechanic shop they said it looks fine on their end. Then hour later it got dark and battery died again. Use a Jumpstarter to get it to turn on but the car would die 15 seconds later. Eventually it would just die soon as I remove the charging cables. 

Then yesterday I buy a brand new altinator and have a different car shop install it. Today I pick it up and they tell me the other shop left a lot of bolts/cables unteight.... They left the car running for me to show everything is fine. I drove off, 2 mins later I'm going up this hill and battery light flickering again, went to Orielly they said they can't test the new alternator because the battery is reading low, it died as I was trying to drive off.

So now it's charging at Orielly once it's charged I plan on running it back to the shop 5 miles down the road.

1opdja7,"Found out my vac pump exploded, pieces got inside the engine and some unaccounted for. It seemed to be running OK post explosion, but I was recommended a new engine. Insight?","I posted here a few days ago about my brakes failing, well at least the booster. Turns out it actually was my vacuum pump that obviously feeds into it.

It was explained to me that when the pump broke, parts of it shattered off including the arm. A few pieces were found and cleaned out, others were not. During that call I was told that they recommended a new engine (10k plus labor), as it could simply fail on the way home, or in two years (who knows). And if I didn't want a new engine, that I probably should go drive to a dealer and trade it in asap.

My problem is I am broke. I don't have the money to replace the engine, and I don't have the means to take on a car payment. In turn the only answer really is to hope for the best, but I wanted to get some insight.

First, when it happened I was on the HWY getting onto an off-ramp. Once failed I ended up driving home about 5 miles while muscling the brake. Luckily the road was only 35mph and fairly empty. Yesterday I ended up just going for it after some mixed feedback on safety. But I went when the roads were empty, and the place is only a couple miles away in town (made it).

The reason I am sharing that is because the car was still running fine when I pulled it into the mechanic. So I am curious if it's possible that I lucked out with the parts getting inside the engine, and maybe got lucky? I also was curious if there could be a ""so far so good"" point, where any of the pieces or shavings would've hit the filter, or sunk into the pan. Kind of like ""well if you made a month, your prob OK""... I just hope to maybe stop holding my breath while driving at somepoint.

Lastly... what happens if it does fail? Does the engine simply die, or does something crazy happen that would make it more dangerous than normal?

Thoughts? Sorry this is a bit long!

1opcop4,P0128 code,"I have a 2016 Dodge Durango. I recently replaced the water pump because the pulley had become loose and was causing a coolant leak.

Shortly after, the check engine light came on with a P0128 code.

I inspected the thermostat and found that it was stuck open, so I replaced it. After installing the new thermostat, the coolant temperature now consistently stays between 200–210°F, and the vehicle runs normally. The coolant reservoir is full, and I properly bled (burped) the cooling system to remove any trapped air.

However, the P0128 code remains as a permanent code even though the issue has been resolved. I’d like to know if there’s a specific procedure or drive cycle required to clear the permanent code, or if I might have missed something in my diagnostic process.

My car  Acura TSX 2010 (bought used in 2020 @ 145,000): 

- 5.5 years, and accumulated 27,300 miles, about 25 to 30 miles a day (if I had to estimate, I drive 80% city and 20% highway for when I go out of town for the year)

- fuel system cleaning on November 28

- replaced this year: spark plugs, battery, cabin filter, A/C blower motor fan, engine filter cleaner, radiator fluid flushed and replaced, all break pads and rotors and calipers are 1 to 2 years old from each other, flushed and replaced brake fluid when I replaced rear rotors

- replaced front upper control arms (ball joints) this year 

- replaced left rear TPMS sensor and eventually will with the remaining 3 

- replaced drive belt/serpentine belt  

- routinely oil change when I’m at 30% to 25%

- “check VSA, check brake system and check ABS” lights just came on yesterday afternoon and will have a fuel cleaning device done on November 28 hopefully as well as get the codes read on this.

Some people leave the power on and put the key in axillary position, leave a brick on the accelerator pedal to let the car open the plate so they can clean while it’s on the car. However to clean an electronically controlled throttle body you would need to disconnect the battery before removal of the throttle body for cleaning. Be very cautious not to put too much pressure on the butterfly plate as the electronic motor has specially calibrated gears that could easily be out of the correct position if too much pressure is applied, if that happens you might need a new throttle body. Be aware after the cleaning and reconnecting everything, the car might run rough or funny for a few drives. During this time the ECU is “reprogramming” the throttle body to the correct idle and throttling positions.

As for the p1101, that indicates a problem with the MAF sensor. Just cleaning it won't fix it if the sensor has failed and not just dirty. 

The most likely cause is a problem with the sensor. Cleaning the MAF is the first step to fixing it. If cleaning it didn't fix it, then the next step is to test it with a scan tool to see what the grams per second reading is. If you can't test it, change it. If that didn't fix it, then you move on to what you have done. Since you didn't test it or change it, you may have done those other things for nothing."

Jacking up both drive wheels (front for you) may help debug, if you have jack stands, with wheels free to turn mid air. Block off the rear wheels!

Reverse gear probably has not much left (or designed originally?) for synchros so reverse might be the early warning signal for clutch travel problem. Since there's no adjustment on hydraulic clutch vs cable or linkage driven clutch, you should try bleeding the clutch AND looking at the action and condition of the slave cylinder if you can ..slave probably sits low exposed to road water,salt etc (easy to see on pickup trucks, not easy on front wheel drive transverse engines).

But last time my slave cylinder rusted and started getting stuck, it was sticking in the DISengaged position, opposite of wondering if your slave just doesn't want to fully do its full travel while you are applying fluid pressure with pedal down.

DIY vs pro inspection/debug decision for you.

Tesex01 (Score: 1): Honestly. Makes no sense. 

If it is clutch not disengaging engine. Then no gears would go in.

If it is gearbox (synchronizers) you should be able to put it in gear after waiting few seconds for gearbox to stop spinning.

Try with engine off. If it works that way. Then try pressing clutch all the way, wait 5-10 seconds and then try shifting into the first gear. Or shift into any gear that goes in and then into first without lifting the clutch.

I guess first gear synchronizer is shot. Otherwise there is no physical possibility for input shaft to spin only first gear and not others"

(I have been very sick the past few days and have not had the time to locate the origins of the leak yet)

I just had my Jeep into a speciality Jeep shop a few weeks ago where they did extensive work to get my Jeep back in good shape. One of the things they did was replace my steering column.

A few days ago I was driving and smelled something like newly laid tar. Then I see in my mirror the liquid as I drive. I pull over and then see this all over my drivers side engine bay/etc. I clean up as much as I possibly can from underneath the jeep and let my mechanic know. They seem to be in agreement and said to tow it to them.

I do 90% of the work on my own jeep, but I’ve been so busy with work I haven’t had time.

Before I take it back to this mechanic, I’m curious to gather opinions on the situation. My reservoir was hanging unbolted in the engine bay. I’m unsure if this failure occurred because of the work they did to my Jeep or just freak timing since it’s a 30 year old vehicle and the more you mess with it, the more things start to fail.

I’m tempted to do this work myself when I have some free time. But this is my only vehicle which makes it more difficult.

If this was also a failure on the mechanic, then I might try to see how they can work with me on this. Not to mention, a few days after getting it back, my rear driver wheel almost flew off because they didn’t torque the lugs down… the one specialist drove out to me immediately to fix the situation and apologised profusely. I want(ed) to give them a second chance because they’re overall a great jeep speciality shop… but after this newest issue I’m having second thoughts.

whiplash-willie (Score: 1): Agree.  Crank radius is the perpendicular distance from the centerline of a rod journal to the centerline of the crank.

In very general comparison terms, engines with longer strokes can generate more torque because they can have longer radius on the crank, subject to a geometry limit where the rod would hit the cylinder wall at the bottom, thus getting wider cylinders until the whole system gets out of balance or too expensive to manufacture."

I have a 2013 Nissan Armada Platinum. Auto level rear end and the works, bought as a tow vehicle.

It’s always been finicky with temps since I got it.  It would tow fine for any amount of time, then randomly start fighting me on temps.

It’s always heated up fast taking off and reversing.  I’ve read on armada forums that heating up fast in reverse is a 2x4 issue and considered normal, but not too worried about that, I don’t reverse much when towing, mostly just to park and unhitch, which isn’t a big deal to put it in park and let it cool down once or twice (rarely needed)

Randomly though, it will start heating up, completely unhitched even, if I sit at a light too long or in a drive through, I pay attention to gauges, and if I notice it, throwing it in neutral cools it back down.

Im wondering if it’s the clutch or something like the torque converter. I would like to get ahead of it if it can prevent transmission failure.  I come from Silverado subreddits where the torque converter grenading itself leads to an entire trans replacement.  Im doubting the torque converter bc it will do this in tow mode out of overdrive, which should lock out the torque converter from my understanding.

Also driving on a flat will ruin the tire so you’re doing both the wheel and tire. It’s best to get it fixed sooner than later.

Welding is absolutely a fix. The wheel shop in my area puts on layers of weld and the entire wheel is straightened and trued. The most permanent fix doesn’t look good and it doesn’t affect balancing either. Should be around $150-200 USD. Look for a reputable shop who is knowledgeable, many will turn you around for liability but it can be done.

The hand primer bulb cannot be pumped hard – it stays soft. When squeezing the primer bulb, you can hear “popping / squirting” and there is air inside.

I want advice from someone who already solved this: where does the 1.5 dCi most commonly suck air on the low pressure side? Is it more likely the hoses near the filter, return line, connectors, quick-couplers, O-rings on the filter, or a crack in the primer bulb?

Is the problem definitely caused by that air?

With ignition off and bulb soft, pinch the hose from tank to primer (where you already tried). If bulb becomes hard ,note that.
Now pinch the hose between primer bulb and fuel filter. If bulb becomes soft again or bubbles appear, that tells you which segment is leaking.
Pinch the return hose to the tank (if you can identify it) to see if that affects the bulb.
=> The segment whose pinching cures the bulb indicates the leak is in that segment or its nearby connectors.

Visual / tactile inspection:
Inspect hoses for cracks, splits, chafing, soft spots, or fuel soak marks. Flex the hose while watching for bubbles coming out of the primer bulb or connectors.
Replace any old, squishy rubber hose you find — they’re cheap and often the cause.

Transparent test piece:
Temporarily fit a short length of clear diesel-rated tubing (suitable for diesel) between suspect connections so you can watch for bubbles while cranking/priming. Bubble source = leak location.

Clamp and isolate:
Use a proper hose clamp to temporarily clamp the suspect tank inlet at various points and watch bulb and bubble behaviour. Don’t clamp the line for long while running the pump—just to locate the leak.

Disconnect return at filter:
With the engine cranking/priming, disconnect the return line at the filter and watch for bubbles coming back into the filter or down the return hose — bubbles on the return indicate air being sucked in somewhere upstream.

Check primer bulb check valve:
Remove the bulb (should be easy) and inspect the tiny one-way valve(s). You can blow through in the permitted direction only; any leak back is a failure.
You may need to replace any of the following 

the tank → primer rubber hose,primer bulb, filter O-rings / seals and any banjo washers, brittle quick-connects at the tank(they are plastic connectors) or maybe even the lift pump assembly well regardless of what you swap out you can test if you solved the issue by repeatedly pumping the primer bulb until it becomes firm and no bubbles appear in a transparent test tube or hose ,after that 

Start the engine and run at idle, then slowly rev while watching for return bubbles and leaks. If it doesn’t stall up the rev range you fixed it.
After driving for a bit after fixing it do check all the clamps if they are still holding"

1oowts2,"Mazda 6 2.0i (LF-DE) burning 1L oil per 200km; compression and leakdown fine, need advanced insight","I’m struggling with massive oil consumption on my 2008 Mazda 6 GG 2.0i (LF-DE engine, \~360,000 km / 224,000 miles).  
The engine otherwise runs perfectly, starts instantly, idles smooth, strong power, but burns roughly 1L per 200 km (1 quart per 120 miles).

Symptoms:

* Blue smoke only under full throttle / heavy load
* No smoke at idle or cruising
* Noticeable blow-by (oil cap lifts slightly when loosened)
* No coolant loss or “mayo” under the oil cap
* Fuel trims STFT/LTFT within ±2%
* O₂ sensors show normal combustion
* No misfires, rough idle, or compression loss

Work Done / Tests:

* Valve stem seals replaced → no change
* Leakdown test → \~15% loss across all cylinders (consistent)
* PCV valve replaced last year (under intake manifold) → tested: opens correctly
* Engine flush + piston soak (ATF/acetone) → minor change only
* Compression even across all cylinders
* No oil in coolant, no coolant in oil

My Theories:

* Oil control rings stuck or oil return holes blocked by carbon
* Partial blockage in oil separator (valve cover / below intake)
* PCV might open too late, only under high pressure
* Less likely: internal head gasket leak between oil gallery and cylinder, no coolant mixing

Questions:

1. Are there known LF-DE oil ring / carbon issues?
2. Has anyone successfully freed up stuck rings using B12, ATF/acetone, etc.?
3. Could a restricted oil separator cause this level of oil consumption with a working PCV?
4. Anyone seen oil leak through head gasket oil passage without coolant involvement?

Extra Info:

* Engine starts perfectly and idles great
* No misfires, no rough idle

I’m looking for real-world LF-DE experience, not just generic “rebuild it” advice. I want to understand why this engine is burning oil before tearing it apart.

1op9otx,2017 Mitsubishi Mirage Parasitic Battery Drain?,"Hello! I don't know much about cars but am really just looking for some advice here.

  
I have had a 2017 Mitsubishi Mirage SE since 2023. It's my first car. Since I bought it, I've been dealing with recurring battery issues. In 2 years, I've replaced the battery three times now. Every time I bring it in, they claim this is happening because I don't drive my car enough. I hate driving and do it as seldom as possible, but typically take my car out 1-2x a week.

This most recent incident is really frustrating me. I got the battery replaced by Mitsubishi in July of this year. Left with no explanation other than ""drive it once a week or so."" Well, I got in my car last week and it was half dead (dash turned on with AC and such, but that's it). I had last driven it about 10 days prior. I jump-started it and drove it around for a good 20 minutes. The next day, I went to run it, and nothing. No power whatsoever.

Should a 4-month-old battery really die in 10 days from not being driven?? I asked about parasitic battery drain the last time I was there, and they brushed me off. Do I really just have to get a new battery again and start running my car every day, even when I don't need to drive it? This just seems strange to me.

Again, I'm very inexperienced with cars and have no technical knowledge. I guess I'm just looking to find out whether the Mitsubishi people are just ignoring a larger issue with my car? Do I need to push more next time I bring it in? They've been replacing my battery for free since there's a 2-year warranty on each one, so I feel like a bit of an ass having them replace it for me over and over, but this whole thing seems very strange.

 If anything I would drive it more often (4x a week minimum), then if there is another battery issue you can say, “yeah, I’ve been driving this 4 times a week , decent length drives (20-25 minutes) and I’m still having issues.” They now see that it’s not an issue where the car is not driven often and will be more prone to look into it more….I would hope. 

Has the alternator been tested? I know the most common cause of a dead battery other than sitting, is a weak or non performing alternator. I mean if your alternator just stopped functioning period you would see a battery light on the dash or a message of some sort saying charging system failure. 

If your alternator is under performing then it’s not charging your battery to its optimal state of charge (around 85%) and letting it sit drains the battery, starting it drains the battery then you drive it and it doesn’t charge enough to get you through the next cycle of sitting and starting then after maybe say 4 months the battery is dead (replacement dead) and car don’t start.

But yeah, there are a ton of factors that can affect battery performance but the amount you drive is a big one. It’s not completely unheard of to have a battery go bad in 4 months if it sits. Your car loves being driven, it’s good for it. Also if you end up having to jumpstart your vehicle, I would up the drive time to 35-40 minute to be safe."

I received the payout for the initial estimate and supplements for work that was completed prior to the car being sent to the dealer. The remaining payout (up to the ACV) was sent directly to the lienholder. I had gap insurance which covered the balance between the ACV and the total loan amount.

1opicb1,Passing an E-check with check engine light on...ADVICE NEEDED!!,"so i bought a car for $2500 a month ago. unfortunately the car has given me nothing but trouble since i bought it. took it to the shop today and im looking at $3200 worth of repairs. the transmission is gonna cost me $532 which I can hack, but the exhaust needs to be replaced entirely (system is welded together) and will cost $2615. 

i've had beaters before but usually dont get any major issues for at least 6 months. the owner i bought it from (literal angel) has offered to give me either $2000 back or sell it back to her, which are both great options that im soo grateful to have. 

the mechanic said the car would still be drive-able without getting the exhaust repaired, but the check engine light would still be on and that it will likely cause issues for me with passing e-checks. even if i accept the $2000, ill still be out $1200 for the repairs for the transmission and the exhaust. 

i already gave the shop the OK on fixing the transmission, so now im not sure how to proceed. i can accept the $2000 and use that money towards the transmission repair and just drive around with the check engine light on until its time to renew my registration (and i drive a 2008 honda so i unfortunately would have to get tested to renew in the upcoming year) and try to sell it when that time comes, or i can sell it back to the old owner for $2500, still have to pay the $762 (repair plus inspection fees) and search for a new car which would leave me with no reliable transportation for the time being and on a tight budget to find another one. 

so i guess my question is, would it be possible to pass my emissions test with my check engine light being on due to the exhaust issue? i know by the time by registration is up i will have enough saved for another car, but i was hoping my next car would be newer and more reliable instead of another beater so that kind of puts me on a shorter time limit/smaller budget.

im honestly just looking for any advice on the situation honestly. i know i could be in a way worse position but im not sure what the right move is here.

I'll throw in a few things to give you some food for thought and direction. 

It is a male-dominated industry, but that doesn't mean that it's the same industry it was 20 years ago and that you won't find many places where you will be comfortable and respected. Do your job well, be knowledgeable, be a decent person, and if that's not good enough, there's wheels on the toolbox for a reason. 

People say that if you do a job you love you'll never work a day in your life. But when it comes to many trades, the quickest way to kill a passion is to do it for money. Fighting to get paid to fix a car that The owner doesn't care about does get old.  It's great to have hobbies, it's even better to have a great job that pays for your hobbies. 

If you want to work in the shop, go to a technical school and actually apply yourself. You will need to understand how the systems in a car work together, the basics of how things operate regardless of brand, and become absolutely top-notch at electrical. There are plenty of glorified lube text that just throw parts at cars because there was a code for it, but they don't understand how the system works and they rarely get the repair correct the first time. Understanding how everything works allows you to test to make sure that your repair is correct the first time every time. While building an engine is fun, no one is changing out main bearings in service, but they are tracing down amperage draws, so electrical is a must! And just because you understand something today, doesn't make you invincible. You need to be striving to continue to learn constantly. 

Buy quality tools, keep them clean and organized, and do not lend out electrical test equipment to anyone. And just like with your tools, as you disassemble things make sure the parts are clean and organized because, no you will not remember where everything goes. Follow the repair manual for at least the first time you do a job before you think about taking shortcuts. There is no shortcut worth skipping a torque wrench, a torque wrench will be your best friend.

Working a physical job that takes a toll on your body. You need a solid and regular exercise routine for flexibility and strength training. The moment you back off is the moment you start getting hurt and your body starts to fall apart. Don't take stupid risks, use a lifting device for anything heavy. Don't use your hand as a hammer, take the two seconds to pick up the mallet from your toolbox. Wear gloves, safety glasses, and hearing protection. I would also recommend continuing to go to college with night classes so that if you do end up injured, or just burnt out on it all, you have a backup strategy before you are totally SOL.

Working in a shop is not the only way to spend time in automotive. A great way to be involved in automotive is to get an engineering degree. You can design the vehicles and their systems, you can design how the systems integrate to each other, manage the testing for dimensional/electrical /or even crash, you can even design the manufacturing equipment that makes up the assembly line or even stamps the parts. There are plenty of groups within the engineering teams that all have their race car and motorcycle projects at home, and you track days on the weekend. But they work in CAD and with testing systems, not in a shop.

One last note about education. It doesn't matter what degree you get, it matters how you apply it and who you connect with. The reason ivy League schools are in such demand is not because the level of education is really any better. It is because the people that go there are the ones that you want to connect with to move up in this world. You still need to be good enough for them to be comfortable recommending you to their network, but you'll never get into the network without them. I have multiple degrees now, and my master's degree was a great experience for me, but I chose a private college with better classes rather than a college with higher notoriety, and that was my mistake. I will generally be regarded as an intelligent and successful person, but I won't be regarded that by the people that could have gotten me into positions making 2x to 10x as much money doing the same thing I do now because I didn't have the opportunity to meet them."
1opj9ti,2010 Chevy impala front passenger side creaking/clunking only on right turns. Struts/suspension issue?,"Noise happens during second half of video immediately after blinker turns off.

Last week my car started making a thunking/clunking sort of noise that 100% sounds like it’s coming from the front passenger side tyre, but it’s only happening during complete right turns (wheel turned mostly to the right). The sound can be replicated while parked, so speed isn’t a factor either. 

Over the weekend I had a family friend/out-of-practice mechanic take a look at it, they replaced all 4 wheel bearings. They suspected that the struts/suspension were failing because the car is bouncy when you press down on the front or back end of the body, the struts squeak when the car is pressed in the same way, and there was some visible wear on the bottom rung of a couple of the coils as if they were bottoming out.

After they replaced the bearings, the car now started making the creaking sound heard in the video during right hand turns onto bumpy roads. It’s still making a general thunk/clunk during other right hand turns. I’m suspecting it’s coming from the suspension/struts due to the creaking being similar to what we hear when pressing down on the car. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? Or recognize this sound? If the strut/suspension is failing badly enough to cause this noise, is there any chance that the car is unsafe to drive?

- Remove and replace intake hose $93.06 total (parts & labor)
- Plus $135.55 to remove and replace my thermostat which is unrelated to the problem so optional ($135.55)

1opgcci,2012 rav4 coolant leak issue,"So I recently bought a 2012 rav4, and everything was fine, the car runs and drives great, but I noticed that the coolant tank is empty. 

Took it to my mechanic, he filled it up, couldnt find a leak, and I drove the car home. When I got home the tank was empty again. Took it back, the guys checked it again, left it running and said that they figured out that the coolant tank lid is leaking coolant when the car is running and when the coolant is under pressure. They replaced the lid, I drove the car home, checked the tank - the coolant level was the same, no leaks. 

But today I took the car for a drive on the highway and after 10 minutes of higway speeds, I started smelling coolant, and I stopped. I checked the tank and saw that 90% of the coolant was missing, and I noticed that it went out through the overflow hose and sprayed all over the hot parts of the engine, and that was the smell. The car never overheated. So I'm taking the car back to the shop but I was just wondering if anyone has any ideas what the problem could be.

Firstly, I don't know loads about cars, I'm still learning so sorry if this is a silly question.

I really want to hear my car more when I'm driving, specifically the turbo. I would LOVE the turbo flutter by changing the blow off valve, however I really want to avoid damaging my turbo, so is this something I should avoid?

Alternatively, I'm looking into adding a cold air intake, would this increase sound without causing damage if added correctly?

Also, would you recommend any other modifications to increase the overall engine sound? Also if you wouldn't mind recommending some modifications to increase the overall car performance that would be perfect!

I drive a 2013 Peugeot RCZ 2.0 HDI Manual.

Thank you :))))

Hit me with all the advice, what to look for on the car and the dealership itself, test drive, finance, everything. It’s been a long time since I’ve bought a car and I’m not a car guy.",1,1762375713.0,18,CartalkUK,1762457787,2025-11-05 20:48:33,2025-11-06 19:36:27,"SteveGribbin (Score: 8): Check the MOT history, it's completley free to do and can be accessed on the .Gov website. It'll give you a good indication of how well the car has been looked after. It'll also let you know if the car has an outstanding recall on it.

Run a HPI check. You can either buy a full and proper HPI report for around £20, or you can get a basic text check for around £3 which will show you how many owners the car has had, whether the car has ever been stolen, reported as scrapped or previously written off. The more expensive checks will also check for any outstanding finance on the car.

When you go to have a look at the car, make sure you start it up from cold to make sure it fires up correctly with no funny noises or hesitation. A car which has already been warmed up can ring alarm bells that it may have cold starting issues.

If it's a manual car, push/pull the clutch pedal in/out and listen for any chattering noises which could indicate wear on the clutch components or the flywheel. Select 1st gear and lift your foot slightly to make sure the biting point of the clutch is around the middle of the pedal travel. If the biting point is near the top of the pedal travel, it could mean the clutch is worn.

If it's an automatic, shift from park to drive and feel for any clunks or jolts. This can indicate wear on the torque converter. If it's a VAG group DSG box, feel for juddering which can spell danger.

Make sure all of the warnings lights illuminate when you switch on the ignition and then switch off (except the seatbelt and handbrake) when you start the engine. If they don't, this means a light could have been de-activated to mask a potential issue.

Check under the oil cap and on the dipstick for a yellow, gunky substance often referred to as ""mayo"" this can indicate head gasket issues.

Check the colour of the coolant, it'll usually be red, blue or green. Dirty coolant means it'll likely need to be changed.

Check the air conditioning to make sure it blows nice and cold, also check that the heaters blow hot from all of the vents, especially if the car has dual zone climate control.

Check the tyres, do they all match? If not it's not the end of the world, but can give an indication that the car was run on a budget.

Make sure everything works. Pull or push every knob and button, switch on every light, try all of the infotainment features, make sure both keys work on the remote locking and try each door to make sure they lock and unlock, make sure the windows go up and down etc.

When you drive the car, turn the radio off and drive in silence, listen for any clunks or knocks which would indicate suspension wear, feel for the wheel pulling to one side which would indicate that the tracking is out.

Take a decent length test drive. Try the car through town over speedbumps etc to test the suspension, and get it out onto faster roads so you get a chance to try every gear. On the test drive get the car up to full operating temperature and make sure it doesn't overheat.

If the car has a timing belt, make sure it's been changed in accordance with the recommended schedule if it's due to have had a replacement.

It'll often be cheaper to arrange your own finance if you're not looking to pay outright. Look to see what your bank offers. This cuts out the middle man and means you'll usually save quite a lot in interest. Don't expect much if anything at all in the way of a discount on the sale price of the car, margins on cars are often quite small and dealers make the bulk of their money on finance and warranties.

If you're buying the car outright, put a couple of hundred £ of the amount on a credit card. This will give you protection for the full price of the car (as long as it's under £30,000) under section 75 of the consumer credit act if you ever have any issues that the dealer won't help with.

If the dealership does offer extended warranties, read the small print very carefully as 3rd party warranties often aren't worth the paper they're written on.

Just go in with a sensible head and don't get too excited with  the car and forget to check things!

1op7yy0,What can cause a DPF to become frequently blocked,"My parents have a 2010 Volvo C30 1.6 diesel. Not long after they got it, it went into limp mode and we scanned it with Volvo VIDA and it was a blocked DPF. Put some aerosol cleaner in it, forced a regen from the diagnostics laptop, it revved to \~4000 RPM for a while and all was well. 

It then got blocked again a few months later so in went another can of aerosol cleaner. I saw the pressure figures dropping on the laptop so I could see it was working. 

It then went again so it was taken to the main dealer. They knew this was the 3rd blockage but all they did was charge a huge amount of money to put a refurbished DPF in.

That then blocked after a few months so I took it off the car and soaked it in Wynns off-car DPF cleaner. That worked, but a few months later it was blocked again. 

I put another aerosol can in it and it's blocked again 2 weeks later. During that time they took it for a 100 mile drive so I'm not convinced it's due to town driving. 

  
I've checked the EGR (was surprisingly clean) but cleaned it out anyway. The oil is at the correct level and is definitely the correct type for the vehicle. 

I don't want to take it back to the main dealer because they evidently don't care about fixing the root problem, just extracting money for a new DPF that will block again soon. 

I'm thinking of getting a used DPF, gutting it and welding it back up. I've heard people say ""don't do that"" because soon it'll fail the yearly MOT, but those messages go back 6+ years so If I do it to a spare one then I think it's worth the gamble personally. (There's a place locally that can program it out as well) 

I'm trying to find a solution before they scrap the car. It's quite a nice drive when it's working and only has \~80,000 miles on it. Sticking injector? Can you diagnose one by using a screwdriver as a makeshift stethoscope? Can another faulty component cause this issue?

* Is it worth going for the **funder-maintained** option, or better to maintain the car myself? I’d like to save money if it’s just basic servicing, but I’m not sure what’s typical over 3 years.
* Do tyres usually need replacing on low-mileage leases? I’ve seen people mention this, but I can’t imagine needing new tyres after just 18K miles total… or am I wrong there?
* Anything specific I should look out for in the contract or at the end of the lease (extra charges, wear and tear, etc.)?

I’m totally fine with not owning the car - I just want something reliable and predictable without the ownership headaches. Any tips, experiences, or “wish I knew before” advice would be much appreciated!

1op3y36,Advice on quotes for wet timing belt replacement,"I have a Peugeot 2008 Puretech which is almost 10 years old, and unfortunately is due for its timing belt to be replaced.   I know, I know, but I plan on keeping the car for a good while,so the decision is made.  No advice needed on that!

So I have requested quotes from three different places.  The first two were local independents (one is my regular garage); and the third was the local Peugeot dealership (just for fun).  Here are there quotes (incl VAT):

**Independent 1:**  
11 hrs labour and a wet belt kit:   £1397

**Independent 2:**  
8 hrs labour, a wet belt kit, plus water pump, multi V belt and oil/filter change: £1169

**Dealership:**  
Phone estimate of £599

Obviously I was really surprised about the dealership quote.  I even said as much ""Are you sure? that's way less than my other quotes"", and they confirmed.   Does anyone know what sort of cost this should be?   Could the dealership just be much more efficient at doing this job?

Secondly - the second quote includes stuff I didn't specifically ask for. Anyone know if this is actually needed or not?  I guess the first one assumes not; don;t know about the third, but surely not at that price.

3. Add a for sale sign inside the car

Ultimately, wherever you list it, it’s more important HOW you make the advert and how you price it. 

You need to take clear photos from all exterior angles. Photos that don’t cut any of the car off, are in focus, are in daylight, and preferably have a nice background. All these things matter psychologically. 

Take a photo of each wheel and each tyre. 

Bonus points for taking photos of scratches, dents, and rust - this will show that you’re being honest. 

You need to take clear photos of the interior: each seat, each footwell, the steering wheel, gearstick, roof lining, dashboard. Include the boot, and under the boot carpet if it lifts easily. 

You need to take photos of the underside to show rust. 

You need to photograph the engine bay.

You need to describe the car clearly and in detail. Specification. Any known faults. Service history - what services carried out on what dates, at what mileage, and by what garage. 

 Report on the brand, age, and tread depth of the tyres. 

Huge bonus points for adding a walkaround video and a “cold start” video - most engine problems will appear at cold start so you’ll give buyers loads of confidence by adding this, and put yourself ahead of 95% of other sellers of the same car. 

I can advise on how to think about pricing when I know a bit more what sort of car it is. There will be different approaches depending on whether it’s a daily driver or a supercar. 

I can go more in depth if that would be helpful, and provide examples from our website?

Specifically the IVA part as your car is under 10 years old.

There's more too. That page lists common things you typically need to change to get a car to pass the IVA test. However, it could cost a lot more or you have to wait 6 months if the specific model you're importing (based on engine and whether it's a manual or automatic) hasn't been imported by anyone else before. This is because you can essentially piggyback on a much stricter test if it's been done before, but obviously you cannot do that if someone hasn't imported the exact model before."
1ooom11,Potential insurance write off?,"Hi hope everyone's well. Unfortunately got into a minor car crash a few days ago where someone tried to cut to the right side from the left in the middle of a roundabout and made a bit of a dent in the passenger door, alongside some paint scratches. Had a talk with a bodyworks garage who priced 600 quid for a door replacement and paint job, which me and the person who hit me agreed on will be best to be done through insurance.

A problem that they mentioned to me was that insurance will write off the car if the repair cost is greater than the market value of the car. Although I found it a bit difficult to believe that 600 quid would be more than the market value of this car, I understood that insurance companies may not necessarily reach out to the bodyworks garage that I got in touch with and therefore go through someone else who would charge me a lot greater. 

This is the first time I got into a car crash with somewhat significant damage so my question is whether the repair for this car would amount to more than the retail value?

The market value prior the the accident of a car like that is probably between £900-£2000 depending on many different factors so tbh it’s mostly the insurers discretion however if they do write it off they’ll likely give u a buy back option that may be worth it.

Novel_Tension_3759 (Score: 1): The better question is how much the car is worth to you. Insurance companies will generally write a car off if the cost of repairing it exceeds half the market value of the car. However, older, less valuable cars are even less likely to be repaired, even if the cost of that repair is less than half the total value of the car. A 2008 Clio is not worth very much money so the chances of it being written off are fairly high.

You essentially have three options:

Option 1. Let the insurance write the car off, you'll probably get around £1500 tops to buy something else and go on your merry way. This is the best option if you want (and can afford) to get something else or if the car has other issues that may be expensive down the line. 

Option 2. Let the insurance company write the car off. You'll get your payout (probably around £1500) and you can use that money to buy the car back off them at a heavy discount and pay for the repair yourself. This is the best option if the car is good, reliable, has sentimental value or you can't really afford to get into something else right now. 

Option 3. Basically option 2, except you don't repair the car at all and just drive it around with a dent in the door. This is the best option if you don't care what anyone else thinks and are happy to save money at the expense of driving a shitter. In reality no one will care that your car has a dented door apart from you. You'll also never worry about parking because it's already damaged. Obviously this option doesn't apply if the door has to be repaired to work or to pass an MOT.

Ultimately, I don't know your situation but if the car is a decent runner, don't scrap it for the sake of a door."
