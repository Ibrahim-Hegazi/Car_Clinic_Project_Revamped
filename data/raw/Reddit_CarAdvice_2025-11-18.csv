Your battery can be perfectly fine for cold starts, because there’s much less friction than when everything is warmed up and at the right, right clearance - and hot-starting simply takes too much power. 

You could check this by using a multimeter to inspect voltage drop and/or amps pulled during a hot vs. cold start.

If you tear off the oil filter body, then at that point you will need to CAREFULLY spin off the base using a chisel and a hammer. The chisel only touches the oil filter remnants, and you need to make sure that you are applying force in a counter-clockwise direction!

The problem doesnt occur if I dont drive the car (for example if it sits for a week or 2, the fluid is clear), but if I drive it for a day or 2, the fluid becomes very dark and eventually will cause problems again.

I had hoped that if I kept flushing the fluid the seal will deteriorate enough for it to start leaking outside the cylinders and tell me which ones the problematic one. 3 months into the problem, that has not happened.

Pull cylinder 3 spark plug, take a look and see if it looks ok (charts in abundance online to compare to) pull a different cylinder and compare, swap the plugs.
Swap a coil pack from a different cylinder, see if your code changes cylinders.

E.G: Swap your spark plug from cyl 3 to 2, 2 to 3. Swap your coil pack from 3 to 4, 4 to 3.

If your misfire changes to cylinder 2, it means you have a problem with your spark plug, if it moves to 4, it means you may have a bad coil pack.

If the misfire does not move, then I'd look at the injector, wiring or for damage that could affect 1 cylinder alone. 

I'm not familiar with Volkswagen, but on Honda's you have manually adjusted valves which can be a cause of misfires as well."

Some background, during the last few months (primarily when it’s hot for some reason) I’ll drive the car for 20 mins to 1 hour, shut it off, and when I try to start it again it immediately cranks, starts, and sputters out. For the first two months it started EVERYTIME after the first power loss. Then last month, once a week or so, it will absolutely not start. It cranks, and cranks, and cranks, but doesn’t start. 

UNTIL, it does. Usually a good 60-75 seconds it will harshly start up, idle very roughly for a few seconds and then all will be fine for another week.

 seems that rock auto is out of the ignition switches. i have had terrible issues with those too on these cars..

  lets test the C3I fuse in the left underhood fuse block..

 Test light or multimeter.. you should have unbroken power in the Run, Cranking and Run positions of the key.. 

  this tests the one of the ignition switch outputs.. 

 also in the left underhood fuse block is the Run/Crank fuse.. that should have power in all positions of the ignition key.. it is direct from the battery positive..

 but lets look at the IGN relay output..  the C3I fuse is controlled by the IGN Relay output.. as is the PCM fuse.. 

  the ignition relay is powered by the PINK wire from the ignition switch.. in the Run Crank Run positions.. 

 why i ask you to pickup the 30 foot test leads.. in the Rear fuse block.. should be in the trunk.. you can just use a test light.. 

 the SBM fuse and the PCM/CRU fuses are powered by the white wire from the ignition switch.. in the Off, Run, Cranking, Run and Off positions.. no drop outs until you get to the locked position.. 

 also in the trunk.. the Crank fuse.. that only gets power in the Cranking position from the yellow wire on the ignition switch.. 

 we are not done..  back in the left underhood fuse block.. IGN fuse.. should have power in all positions of the ignition switch.. it too is Bat+ 

 that feeds 2 sections of the ignition switch.. the orange wire that feeds the IGN 3 relay in the instrument panel fuse block..  test the ABS fuse for power only in the RUN position of the ignition switch.. not while cranking and again in the RUN position of the switch after cranking.. 

  last step you can probably pass on.  from the brown wire of the ignition switch. to the ACC Relay to the WSW fuse and the RFA WSW fuse.. those are wiper fuses.. 

 print this.. its about half an hours work..

1ozrxei,Water pump gasket,"Scion TC 2006 Automatic 2.4

So basically I'm currently not home and my brother is the one taking care of my car, couple days ago my cars water pump messed up and my brother took it to get the water pump replaced. 

He's been driving it for two days already. As far as I know the water pump comes with a paper gasket or a sort of black rubber band that u put around the water pump. The mechanic said the paper gasket wasn't necessary and the rubber band is enough for it to seal, no permatex was used or sealant, as far as I know you use both for it to seal. Is it actually necessary? 

I'm just worried because I've been through so much with this car and I don't want it leaking coolant.

Original equipment catalytic converters tend to be expensive. You can purchase and install a cheaper aftermarket converter, unless you're in California or another state that follows CARB rules.

Agreed with the exhaust spring idea. This is one of two springs that mount the cat converter to the resonator under the car. This is a 2001 Forester but is essentially the same.

1ozow72,Do I really need a $500 ADAS recalibration just to replace the lower grille? (2020 Honda Civic Sport Touring),"Year/Make/Model: 2020 Honda Civic Sport Touring

I am in San Diego. I was driving up to the mountains to go hiking, my lower grille a couple clips were already loose but it wasn’t hanging down. As I was driving up the highway I thought I hit something (didn’t see anything on the road) and something was coming off. I pulled over and well the whole thing came off and fender liner with it. I am a female in my young 20s and always take it to the dealership. I dont know much about second hand shops but I don’t want to pay thousands for a simple lower grille change. So that’s my story I would really like some help to make sure I’m not getting ripped off. I called around and hearing different things. 

I bought an aftermarket lower grille and took it to a shop to have it installed. They’re telling me:
	•	They need to remove the entire front bumper to install it
	•	Because they have to disconnect things behind the bumper, I’ll need an ADAS (Honda Sensing) recalibration
	•	The recalibration is about $500

I’m trying to figure out if this is actually required for my situation.

My questions:
	1.	If there was no collision and I’m only replacing the lower grille, does removing the front bumper automatically mean I have to recalibrate ADAS?
	2.	Is recalibration only necessary if the radar/camera/sensors are moved, replaced, or damaged, or is “bumper off = always recalibrate” standard practice?
	3.	Has anyone worked on a 10th gen Civic front bumper / lower grille and not needed recalibration afterward?
	4.	Does using an aftermarket lower grille change anything here as far as ADAS is concerned?

I don’t want to skip something that’s actually a safety issue, but I also don’t want to pay $500 for recalibration if it’s just a shop being overly cautious or covering liability for basic bumper removal.

Any techs, body shop people, or Civic owners who’ve dealt with this — I’d really appreciate your input.

Thanks.

Yes, it may sound absurd and that's a big part of the reason Honda here are disappearing (terrible roads = plenty of suspension repairs). Removing the whole front grille is an automatic recalibration once the sensors are plugged back in. 

Of course you can skip recalibration and just drive, but don't be surprised if you start getting ADAS malfunction warnings after the repairs. A dealership won't skip recalibration, especially in lawsuit happy California.

Rack and pinion is leaking. Not very strongly, but the inner tie rod boots certainly appear slightly wet, with no puddles forming. The steering does have a little bit of play in the steering wheel before engaging for a full turn. Think I'll go ahead and replace my tie rod ends while I'm doing this job since those boots are starting to wear.

Sway bar bushings on both ends are falling out and need replacing. I may as well replace the sway bar links while I'm there, since I have already bought those parts.

Spark plugs need to be replaced; apparently, the ones in the engine are the incorrect ones.

CV axle inner boots are torn, not making too much noise, but certainly a cause for concern.

My lower ball joints look okay, and the boots are in good shape, but I figure I should replace them while I'm doing the CV axle anyways since these are common failure points on a 3rd gen 4runner.

Need to flush the coolant and drain & fill the transmission as well, but I figure I could do this on the road while I have some time during Thanksgiving week in San Diego.

Start with cv axle. Seems like the most desperate one.

After that do spark plugs 1) bc it’s easy & takes maybe minutes per plug (maybe 10 minutes per plug if you’re painfully slow) 2) bc fucked up spark plugs can damage an engine.

How over are you on your coolant & transmission change intervals? If over I would do these next. Bc why ruin something / potentially ruin something else on your car.

Sway bar bushing & sway bar links aren’t huge deals. Some cars don’t even have them. However I w/ such a big car if you choose not to do these until later please stay in the right lane. Do not try to pass as emergency maneuvers will be harder to control & take turns very slowly.

The vehicle developed a sway at highway speeds a few months ago. I rotated wheels and changed the front brake and rotors yesterday. 

Tried to drive it this morning and it was all over the place. I had to turn around and make it back home. 
The vehicle seems light on the road. Like, it was being blown around by wind. Wind speed was 0-5mph. It was already doing it, but it’s now dangerous. Feels like a speed wobble. 

Note: I’ve not worked on this vehicle but done suspension work on other trucks and vehicles I’ve owned. I’ve looked it over and bushings look great, sway linkage is great, tie rods look great.

Your best bet is to change the conic gears inside the differential since I see it's leaking like crazy and needs to be rebuilt anyway. Sometimes you can find the gear sets on Italian eBay but your best bet is to ask transmission repair workshops if they have them in stock. If your lorry still has the original setup you have 8/36, or 4.5 ratio as Americans would say. 9/35 or 12/40 were pretty widely used on OM 35/40, less so on the 50/60 due to higher gross weight.

Honestly I wouldn't gear an OM 35/60 higher than 12/40: they weren't really built for highway work and the low gearing was there so they could be brutally overloaded (there's a reason Italy used to have so many public scales, many are still there albeit non-operational).

So to deal with that, Ill be starting at the aftermarket fuse box with 16awg wire into a boost module (dc-dc 3-30v to 5-35) and adjust the voltage output accordingly. Then I should be able to wire the xmas lights to it, hopefully.

And after all that, at some point in between the xmas lights and the boost module I want to throw in a switch to be able to turn them on and off at  any given moment.

About a minute later the check engine light started flashing. I took my code reader and plugged it in and it showed a misfire on 3 of my 6 cylinders (2 on the rear bank and 1 on the front) i was a block away so I limped it back to my house so I could run some diagnostics on it later. By the time I got back to my house the motor had started making a lot of noise. I quickly turned it off and drained the oil out of it. However it wasn't just oil but a ton of fuel as well. I turned it back over after finishing the oil change, hoping the noise would go away but its still there. What should my next steps be? If I did spin a rod bearing would I be able to get compensation for the repair from the company I bought the injectors from or am I totally out of luck?

1ozu3ch,Car makes awful grinding/binding noise on right turns - but no noises if I'm in neutral on the same turn.,"So I'm trying to troubleshoot an issue with my car, a 2013 Mazda 3 with a 6 speed manual transmission, front wheel drive.

  
I'm dealing with an issue where I hear an awful grinding / metal binding noise from the driver's side whenever I make a sharper (90 degree or so) turn. I don't have the issue on gradual, wide sweeping right turns. Also, I recently realized that if I'm in neutral I can rail right hand turns as hard as I want without the noise showing up.

  
This year I've been doing some work (see below) to the car - the awful right turn binding noise was present before the work and is still present after this work:

* Ball joints & lower control arms
* 4 new tires
* Brakes & rotors
* CV axles
* Struts
* Sway bar end links & bushings
* Transmission mount
* Alignment
* Manual transmission fluid drain & fill

I was hoping some of the front-end work — especially the ball joints and CV axles — would solve the right-turn noise, but oddly enough, nothing has changed.  
  
The car otherwise drives and handles great — if I couldn’t hear, I wouldn’t know anything was wrong — but the sound is definitely not normal.  
  
I’m open to any ideas, questions, or diagnostic suggestions. Thanks!

In addition to that package, you probably will want new shock top hats and spring isolators/pads, at a minimum. There may be some common bushings or balll joints that make sense to replace on your way in/out as well… not familiar with your chassis to say for certain. 

You obviously need a solid set of tools, all the appropriate socket/wrench sizes. You will need a jack and jackstands - DO NOT just use the jack. 

I would suggest you have an impact gun and/or breaker bar - suspension hardware is on there tight and you need a good amount of force to get it off. You also need a torque wrench (check toque values before you start and make sure your torque wrenches are able to hit the values required). 
 
You will need a spring compressor set. LEARN HOW TO PROPERLY USE THESE (YouTube, etc). Compressed springs are legitimately dangerous. Use serious caution as you’re disassembling/reassembling your struts. You can rent these from your local parts store, FYI. 

I would recommend a day before you start, spraying down all the nuts and bolts with a penetrating oil (PBBlaster, Kroil, etc). Also, having a MAP or propane torch on hand for seized nuts isn’t a terrible idea. 

And watch a few YouTube DIY videos on how to do this now. It will A) prepare you for how to actually do it, B) make sure you’re comfortable doing this level of work.

Also, as it might be novel to learn, EVEN IF you had access to a tire manufacturer warranty as the original purchaser of record with suitable records of rotation, they do not simply replace your tires with new.  They will pro-rate the portion of your warrantied tire life that you did not receive so if you were at the wear bar at 48,000 miles on a 60,000 mile warrantied tire they would essentially offer you a 20% off of a replacement.

If you can find a service that can scan the frequencies used by cellphones, that would probably be the best approach.  Trackers generally use a cellular IOT (data) subscription to send their data. Which means anyone is interested has to pay a subscription.  When they don't care anymore, the subscription lapses and the data is no longer collected.

It sounds like the anti-roll bar (we call them sway bar) links have torn rubber boots. They generally are not expensive and can be done in a short amount of time. They look like the picture below.

The tire is not repairable and would need to be replaced. Account for cost of install on the wheel and balancing as well.

The parking brake may simply need the cable adjusted to be ""efficient"" - it probably wouldn't hold the car on an incline when tested.

As for the rear sub-frame, there are a number of anti-corrosion products that can be applied to it that can help slow down any rust that is present. Check with the inspecting shop if this is an acceptable solution. Hope this helps!

1ozn2an,2011 Toyota Avalon 3.5L V6; Hit an Animal on the Highway,"I was driving approximately 75 mph on the highway in rural Missouri last night when I hit a an animal roughly the size of a small-medium dog. It hit my bumper and did a lot of damage from my perspective. I towed it home because I think the radiator was damaged and didn't want to risk running the engine for too long. When I got it home, I jacked it up and took off the passenger side tire (where the majority of the damage is) to get a better look at the damage. Ill attach all the photos I took for my insurance here minus the photos of the fur since that has no mechanical diagnostic value. I wanna know, how screwed am I? Insurance claim is predicting the car being totaled with no mechanic estimate yet so that prediction is based completely off me telling them theres large damage with leaking fluids.

1ozjplc,"Posting this to get some honest mechanic opinions about what happened to my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee (4.0L, 42RE, ~133k miles).","I’m looking for some honest mechanic advice about what happened to my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee (4.0L, 42RE, \~133k miles).

Before all of this, the Jeep actually ran fine. The only issue I had was a small coolant leak — I had to add a little coolant every 100-150 miles, but the vehicle ran smooth.

I took it to a shop to diagnose the coolant loss. They said it was a cracked radiator so I had that replaced. When I picked it up the mechanic mentioned he struggled getting the transmission cooler lines off the old radiator, but said everything was back together properly.

Shortly after that radiator job, I noticed I was suddenly losing transmission fluid. I brought it back, and that’s when the shop told me the transmission pan gasket was “broken.” This didn’t make much sense to me because I had a fluid + filter + new gasket done about a month earlier at a different shop. To fix the leak, they performed a full transmission service: new fluid, new filter, and a new gasket.  The shop owner mentioned he was using a brand of transmission fluid called Eneos. When I asked him to confirm that was ATF+4, which is what the Jeep requires, he said yes.

Immediately after *this* transmission service, everything went downhill fast. Around 40 miles later the TRANS OVER TEMP light came on, the O/D OFF light came on, I could feel slipping, the ATF smelled burnt. I turned the engine off and had it towed to the shop.

When they dropped the pan again, there were shiny metal flakes in it. They said reverse was no longer working..

The explanations from the shop changed multiple times while I was waiting. First, they told me the transmission was not overheating, it was actually the engine, even though the TRANS OVER TEMP light literally came on. Then it seemed like they started deflecting.  First, they said it might be a bad radiator cap. Then they started saying it was caused by the transfer case, which makes no sense at all.

While waiting, I Googled the Eneos transmission fluid and found out that they don't even make ATF+4.  When I asked the owner to show me what he put in, he showed me a picture on the computer of ""Eneos ECO ATF Plus"".  When I told him that can't go in my Jeep, he said ""oh sorry I confused your vehicle with another, we actually used Valvoline ATF+4....""

They also claimed my transmission had “half a quart of fluid” before their service, which doesn’t make sense because the Jeep was driving fine.

What I’m trying to figure out from people who know these transmissions:

– Does a pattern of **immediate** overheating, O/D OFF, burnt ATF, sudden reverse failure, and shiny metal flakes line up with a service error — like a mis-seated filter, wrong fluid, or pump aeration?  
– Could the mechanic struggling with the cooler lines or doing a makeshift fix during the radiator job cause these issues later?

The shop records their bays, so I’ve requested the video to verify what fluid was actually used.

I’m trying to figure out whether this was just terrible luck with an old transmission, or whether the service itself triggered the failure. Any honest insight — especially from anyone familiar with the 42RE — would be hugely appreciated.",1,1763394439.0,4,mechanic,1763494543,2025-11-17 15:47:19,2025-11-18 19:35:43,"PPGkruzer (Score: 1): How does this part not answer your question?

Thinking they could tell you it wasn't their fault and get you to pay AGAIN is crazy. They must think you're stupid.

Never the fuck ever again. 

The problem isn't you bought a truck, it's you bought into the WRONG truck/brand. 

Ford makes majority of its money from bullshit repairs and warranty bullshit, not via sales. I know this, cus my own mother works for a Ford actually, (first ever domestic dealership she's worked for in over 30 yrs being in automotive finance). She WORKS for them, and will never ever own one, any model. 

So, I am unsure exactly what might be wrong. But you need to dump it. Just do yourself a favor. Before it puts you further in a hole, and you are forced to keep, cus you're trying to get your 'moneys worth' out of it. It will never happen. 

Fords track record is so bad, that even IF it's cared for, good condition, etc. Their resale value TANKS! you lost $10k+ it's original worth, in just the first 3 yrs of ownership. Regardless of miles, condition. 

I'd tell ya, don't bother with domestic at all. They're all trash. (They are, even if people don't want to admit it). They're what keep our mechanics in business.  That and foreign like bmw, Mercedes, land rover. Etc. 

They're also not most sold, they're the most RESOLD trucks in America. So don't give into their bullshit hype either. 

100% ask any actual mechanic on this sub, what brand they work on the most. 100% it'll be domestics, predominantly Fords. 

They're built to break on purpose. Cus it's how they make their money. Dead serious and you can look it up. They are literally outsold in All Categories including their trucks, by EVERYONE else. Even fellow domestic competition. (They bunch up the entire f-series into overall truck sales, then claim most sold. Not a particular model on its own.) 

I don't even understand how they even still sell, especially when they recall MILLIONS, every single fucking year. When are people ever gonna learn? Patriotism shouldn't cost you your hard earned money, to repair shit that shouldn't be a problem to begin with. 


Honestly, an early 2000s, tundra will outlive your truck. And that's pretty fucking sad.

Edit: not a truck, though truck based. I replaced that factory piece of shit, with an 07 Toyota 4runner (base model, 2wd, v6 (as they also came with a V8 as an option. Not just any V8, but the best gas V8 ever made).) that at the time, had 112k miles. Today, it's over 190k. I've had it 10 yrs. Most EXPENSIVE need in all this time, was tires. Bruh, the SUV is almost 20yrs old! Almost 200k miles, and tires are the most expensive thing I had to worry about in 10yrs?! so why the FUCK is your practically new truck, with not even 70k on it, giving you potentially expensive issues? Cus it's a Ford product, that's why.

Oh, and in my ownership, it's never seen a dealership after purchase. And very very few mechanics. As I don't trust the majority  of em. It's only ever been in the shop, cus of my inability to do it myself. Outside of that, it never sees one.

Oil leaks are common in BMWs this age.  I assume the shop spotted it when they were changing in the spark plugs.  AFAIK, one of the common leaks is from the oil filter housing. If not repaired, the oil drips into the alternator and ruins that as well.  Another common problem is that plastic parts in the cooling system get brittle with age, then crack and leak.

If not - very unlikely it ran low on oil pressure (meaning low on oil that the pump wasn't fully lubricating the engine). Probably just a mess and oil finally got down onto something hot enough to make it burn and you saw the smoke from that. Most likely it ended up on the exhaust manifold where it heated up enough to smoke. 

If you're really worried - pull a sample fo oil and send to blackstone for analysis. It'll tell you a lot about the condition of the oil and if there's unusual wear on the oil.

Most likely it was just a mess and they should clean your engine bay and give you a free next oil change. The other place you might see some long term issues is from the serpentine belt (fan belt) if the oil coated that belt. I've had that happen from a detail shop that coated the engine with a light oil of some sort (like armorall or ???) and it lubricated the belt enough that it caused a belt chirp at startup. Had to swap the belt to a clean fresh one. No problems after that. The belts are super durable, just not mean to be lubricated and it might cause it to slip against a pully when it needs to grip.

The pulley also makes noise. When I went to test-drive it before buying it, I didn’t notice this sound until I was already driving back home after purchasing it.

This sound does not occur when I start the vehicle cold, nor when it’s simply idling. It only happens when I accelerate (I can’t provide speed or RPM details because the ABS module isn’t allowing those readings to show). The noise appears, but it isn’t constant. If I take my foot off the gas, the sound stops, and sometimes, if I continue accelerating, the sound also goes away. I’m not sure if I’m explaining it well.

Important detail: the sound can only be heard from inside the car; from the outside it can’t be heard—at least as far as I understand, because when it makes the noise and I lower the window to check, I don’t hear it from outside.

I thought it might be something loose or a part vibrating under the steering wheel. I recorded audio with the phone under the steering wheel, and that’s where it sounded clearer.

I know it’s best to take it to a mechanic, but with the cost of the ABS module I’m a bit short right now.

Do I have any recourse to get any kind of compensation against the original mechanic or should I just suck it up and shell out another $500-$700 to get my brakes AND rotors done, this time the right way?  The mechanic I visited on the roadtrip suggested I never go back to my OG mechanic again.  What should I do?

I’m at the end of my rope on this. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know. 

Month and a half ago CEL comes on. Bring to shop for o2 sensors. 

Leave, CEL comes back on. 
O2 sensors replaced with caveat of “I think there’s is a tsb for this model, for o2 parameter updates”. 

Go to VW dealer and what I got was: “we think the ecm is fried, we can’t order it, and if we do it might not work for $2700”. 

Photos added for current codes, I don’t trust the dealer did anything of value. Any thoughts on this 2.5 Engine ? I’ve seen stuff about camshaft/crankshaft sensors (?)

This car runs fine, has had engine oil and coolant maintenance done recently, new oil dipstick. Literally no other issues. 107,000 miles. 


Please and thank you !

1ozpw8w,Fuel Smell,"I have a 99 Chevy Camaro (5.7 LS1, 117,000 miles) and have had a raw fuel smell for the past few months.  Initial inspection/smelling around and I'm having trouble identifying the source.

Things I've looked at and considered;
Does not seem to be in the engine bay, opening the hood the smell doesnt get stronger & sniffing around I dont smell it under there.

No visable leaks or oily spots under the car where the fuel lines run

Gas tank doesnt appear to be oily

Smell is VERY strong inside the car, the car does not have a trap door mod (common on this car to cut the rear hatch area to access the fuel pump rather than dropping the axel and tank. I think this could indicate its coming from the fuel pump area but since its not cut, idk)

Smell is also prevalent outside at times, though when opening my garage there is no smell except on the interior of the car. I was at an event and overheard someone ask if the old car next to mine was carbed, I think they were smelling my car.

All emissions codes are turned off, I have headers with a catted Y pipe, but it doesnt smell like exhaust fumes. No codes from the front o2 sensors. AIR, EGR, and EVAP codes are deleted.

1ozpd88,How to disable QS-2W remote start brain?,"Interior Alaskan with a 2005 Pontiac Vibe here-
I was in a rush the other day, auto-started my car, and while it was warming up, I noticed one of the tires needed air. 

Not thinking, I plugged in my handheld air compressor and started inflating the tire. 

Inevitably, the autostart 15 min timer ended, and it cut off the engine while I was airing the tire. 

When I went to restart the car, now the autostart is behaving erratically. Per the manual, the only button that should engage the horn is the 
‘Find my car’ button… but every button now- unlock, lock, autostart- causes headlight flashes and a corresponding weak horn honk. 

Trying to manually turn the engine over, the dash lights flicker, and the horn blares as soon as it’s in accessory mode, and no engine starting sounds occur. 

I don’t believe the OEM antitheft is engaged because the corresponding dashboard light isn’t present. OEM fob (on right) behaves normally on car. The battery has sufficient charge (was driven for 2+hours days earlier) and is less than a year old.

I have tried unplugging battery for 30mins, unplugging neg. post and keeping key in accessory mode for 10mins then reconnecting neg post- (saw a mechanic elsewhere suggest this)- but these have not fixed it. 

My best uneducated guess is I bricked the inline fuse on the autostart brain- my pickle is: where is the autostart brain under my dash? 

If I can’t disengage the autostart brain, I’m looking at a $300 tow to the closest aftermarket mechanic in town 😭 

TL;DR: I think I surged my autostart electronics- how do I disengage the brain so I can drive it to a mechanic to fix?

Well... I don't see why.  You can have better cam profiles with an OHC design than with a pushrod design, especially if you compare flat tappet designs vs roller rocker arms on an OHC.

If you are using an OHC with a rocker arm, you still get the benefit of the rocker ratio too.

In high compression and high performance applications especially, you can get some pushrod deflection, so your valve opening isn't as accurate as it is with an overhead cam design.

Today's engines with turbos, variable valve timing, and variable  intake lengths gets a lot of the best of both worlds.

Anyway, this engine is equipped with a dual stage oil pump. It's configured to output 25 PSI in low mode and 65 PSI in high mode.

P06DD: stuck in low mode and can't switch to high mode. RPMs are limited by \~3k.

P06DE: stuck in high mode and can't switch to low mode.

There are many reasons why the pump stuck. The pump theory of operation can be found [here](https://youtu.be/eUxfvdoA6VY?t=849).

Long story short, it can be anything. E.g. an electrical problem (bad wiring - shake the harness gently), a bad oil cooler housing, bad solenoids, bad oil pump, loose oil galley bolts under cam phasers, clogged/cracked oil pickup, wrong oil, etc. A bad oil pressure sensor is less likely since PCM has some tests to verify the readings. There's a dedicated trouble code for a bad sensor. However, you can throw a known good sensor and retest."

1ozv5ne,Drop in MPG,"Hi,

A few weeks ago, I brought my Toyota Corolla '21 to a dealership for a random check due to a discrepancy in tyre air pressure readings. Since then, I have noticed a couple of changes.

Firstly, I've observed that the parking brake now automatically engages when shifting the gear to park mode, and it disengages when I move from Park (P) to Drive (D). Previously, I had to manually engage the parking brake before parking and press the acceleration pedal to disengage it when moving to Drive. While this may seem like a helpful feature, it has caught me off guard.

Secondly, I’ve noticed a significant drop in fuel efficiency. Before the service, I was getting around 67-68 mpg, but since getting the car back, it has dropped to approximately 58-59 mpg. Although my driving conditions remain consistent, I’m curious if the drop could be attributed to winter weather or if there might be another underlying issue. 

Does anybody had this issue ? 


FYI I had it serviced few months ago. 

Thanks.

My currently daily drivers computer says I'm averaging 75mpg, but my wallet says I'm averaging 68mpg. Car mpg computers usually overread quite a lot. Given that the way that the parking brake works has changed, I'd guess that Toyota did a software update while it was in there and now it's giving you more accurate mpg readings.

The parking brake would always engage automatically, I think you can turn it off if you want to. My current car needed to have manual activation of parking brake which seemed a bit strange to me until I realised it was turned off. 
In the winters, the average does drop noticeably so I wouldn’t bother too much."

335d all day.

BMW split tailgate is a nice feature.

Downsides to the BMW - boot is a bit smaller due to the rear wheels intruding - the Golf/Leon floor is essentially a regular rectangle whereas the BMW wheel wells shave off about 25% of the boot floor.   BMW manual seat adjustment (if it doesn't have electric option) is rubbish compared to VAG.  Earlier xDrives suspension was not the best (springs a bit soft), many owners like me fitted AC Schnitzer uprated springs.  Later models had some of the shortcomings addressed.  Adaptive Suspension is a nice option to have and can be used to stiffen the feel of the suspension.

Seats: 5
Boot Space: Bigger than 288L (Size for my Getz)
Mileage: Lower than 80,000
I’d prefer automatic as I plan to keep the car for 5 years and maybe even more.

Before you start hating, I’ve done quite a bit of research so I just want you advise me where I’m going wrong if anything I’ve mentioned is not right.

1. BMWs have timing chain issues
- This is a B47 engine, with full FSH where they’re least likely to happen, I will ensure the gearbox has been changed atleast once if necessary 

2. BMWs are driven rough and advised to change oil at 18k
- I will ensure they have receipts for oil change every 10k and even better if serviced at BMW which I can see ln the IDrive

3. BMW parts can be very expensive and maintenance is high 
- I will buy 1 year warranty which will reduce the costs drastically for major repairs, then save within that year to pay for the next year repairs (I do not pay bills nor rent so easy to save)

4. Insurance is high in BMWs for young drivers 
- in my case it’s 2k, it’s the same as a Kia Picanto, regardless I’ll have to pay around this for my first year on any car as I’m young and live in London 

5. DPF issues
- I am only going to do motorway journeys anyway and it’s the main reason I didn’t choose a smaller car 

6. Mileage too high
- Diesel engines if maintained well can go up to 200k

Bad assumption. Purchasing warranty almost never works out in your favour. The only warranty really 'worth' anything is the original manufacturers warranty, otherwise once you go through all the if's and but's you'll find third-party warranty isn't worth the paper it's written on.

2. Occasional track driving 
3. Road trips, enough room for tent, camp chairs, a passenger or 2 and related luggage (usual 2 duffels)
4. General daily shit (going to the shops a couple times a week, I work from home)

Right now i own a BMW 125i that does all these things, gets 40mpg when I need it to, but track and B road, wow these cars are floppy! The handling is disappointing (on a 60k miles car with recent factory replaced suspension).

As I see it I have 2 options.

Modify my 2009 manual E82 125i (already remapped running approx 280BHP) to make the suspension better with the following:

Subframe mounts £80
Rear sway bar £40 
Front camber plates £120
Bilstein B12 kit £800
Labour - £1k

Approximately £1800-2000 all in with labour included. I know it'll be a fantastic car after this BUT, it won't have an LSD, and future maintenance costs will be high (driveshafts, vanos, ofhg, clutch and flywheel, wheel bearings, any job on these is £££).

OR

Sell the bimmer for ~£8K and get a GT86. 

Good suspension from the factory (or buy one with coils), LSD from the factory (important for the track stuff), will have the room for the road trips, no idea on fuel economy, much lighter than the BMW which I definitely prefer, maintenance costs likely much lower, but less power than the BMW.

1ozflj7,Choosing replacement Xenon bulbs,"I've got D3S Xenon dipped beams on my car (a 2014 Yeti) and one of the bulbs has gone so I need to replace it, probably ideally both of them.

OE is Philips XenEcoStart which I can get posted to me for about £60, but is it worth spending extra here? 

I have zero interest in blinding anyone oncoming, and this is my dipped, not full, beams so it's not as if they're the bulbs I'd be using when I need loads of light anyway.

Prices start at £40/bulb for a Halfords special and seem to be mostly around ££70-90 but many go up to double that.

What's the benefit here, and what's worth paying for? 

Reading around I see conflicting advice on how important the different temperatures are but I don't know how much of that is that it's a bit cool to have a blue tint or to look more like LED light, or just people trying to get the brightest-possible headlights.

My night-time driving is mostly a fairly even mix of motorways and in-town with a bit of proper countryside back-roads where I'll mostly be on full beams or stationary waiting for oncoming traffic to pass.

Any suggestions for what I ought to get?

verone3784 (Score: 39): Honestly, most people lost interest in Mitsubishi when they completely shit themselves by killing the base model Lancer, the Evo, and bastardized their entire lineup with half-baked crossovers. The last straw for me was when they defiled the Eclipse nameplate by bringing out that hideous Eclipse Cross thing.

They were completely tone deaf to the markets that actually wanted to buy their cars, and that's why they almost went under, needing to be propped up by the Renault-Nissan alliance.

Then they got involved in a Japanese emissions scandal around their Kei cars, which meant they violated the terms of their agreement with Nissan on their joint Kei venture, and Nissan now own a controlling interest of 25% of the company as a result.

I'd hazard a guess that Nissan are probably pushing them into the UK market again to sell the new Colt and the Outlander PHEV since there's more than likely demand for both models on the UK market.

Nissan and Honda - and by extension Mitsubishi are also co-developing a set of EV platforms together as well, despite talks for a Nissan-Honda merger falling through last year, so I wouldn't be surprised if the UK sees more of that in the future too.

I have bought a car from a local dealer and only after the purchase I noticed a discrepancy between the most recent record in the service book and the MOT/dashboard display.

Can I legally use a 'mileage correction service' (a few of them advertising in the area) to increase the mileage to the approximately correct number? I understand the information about the correction shoul dbe disclosed to the buyer when I sell the car in the future.

What other options do I have?

Do you have a Costco anywhere near you? They tend to be good on price for tyres.

If it helps any I’ve just paid £120 a corner at Costco for Cross Climate 2s which are all seasons but have a strong snow bias.

Might be a bit more than you want to spend but you don’t have to change them back and they seem equal/better than budget winter tyres in snow.

You might even be able to get the CC3s. They are new so sizes are limited. Not sure CCs are the best tyres for the north of England, even though I’m putting them on my car, but north Scotland think they are a really solid choice.

In the market for a bigger family car from my a180 AMG Line and have my eye on these 2. I’ve come here for all my questions as my wife has had enough of “car talk”😞. 

I what something spacious but also sporty. I have signed PCP on this ford Puna but haven’t actually picked it up yet, so I’m sure I can still change my mind on it. I’ve gone to see the Puma and it looks the part. It’s the ST 1L ( 😭 ) but still nippy and a bit bigger inside with baby seat in the back. But just came across this beaut BMW. 

One of the reasons coming away from Mercedes was the extortionate repair and service bills, which I feel won’t be much different on a BMW? But it does look good. If anyone has this 2 series, please let me know if it’s good with babies/kids for space in the back/ boot space with a pram.

First off, there are customs duties, taxes, and shipping costs all of that can end up being more expensive than the car itself. Plus, you'll need documents showing the car meets local standards (NOM).

Another thing to consider is that Mexico drives on the right side of the road, while UK cars have the steering wheel on the right. That can be unsafe and inconvenient, especially when overtaking or driving on narrow roads. So if what you're after is specifically the right-hand drive experience, it might be easier to look for a JDM car that's already been imported into Mexico or even the U.S.

I spent half the bloody weekend fixing a rattle in the dash and ordering some cheap trim clips off alibaba; the car sounds great when it’s running, sure but for what? To sit on the M25 and watch my fuel gauge drop faster than my will to live?

Honestly, unless you live next door to a racetrack, fast cars are just expensive ornaments at this point. Half the joy’s gone. The only time I get to hear the engine properly is when I start it in the driveway and the neighbour gives me that look.

Does it have to be electric? Depends on the scheme. Mine was EV or Hybrid only

Can it be 2nd hand? Depends on the scheme, mine was new only 

Do I choose the car? Yes, the scheme will have a list, I had 100’s to choose from, I test drove many before picking

Just to add, the benefits are that in most cases it’s fully managed. I pay one figure out of my salary and it includes everything, servicing, insurance, tyres etc. There are some tax benefits to a sacrifice scheme, look into BIK. Lastly, for me, it was a cheap way into a nice car. I bought a Mustang Mach e over 4 years, the lease will cost me around £24k over that period. My opinion is that buying that car, even lightly used will cost more than £24k over 4 years.

They can go wrong, some things are expensive to fix, some things are surprisingly reasonable.

Aircon is common one, the compressor can be changed without removing the engine despite what some people on here say, mine was done for £1500 all in.

Heater control valve can fail, £50 part and £200 in labour to change.

Aircon pressure sensor, £20 part and minutes to repair plus a regas.

Clutch packs on autos are troublesome, the manuals clutch is pretty solid if it is well treated.

Brake discs are expensive so make sure these are checked.

Oil cooler lines can perish, check these, it's about £1-2k to replace them and the cooler.

Expansion tank can suffer from separating in two, first sign this is happening is a slight weep of coolant, look to see if it has been replaced, if not budget for this, not difficult or expensive (though these take 12 litres of coolant be aware).

Mag rides, can fail, seems that there is no rhyme or reason and can be expensive, Audi want 2k a corner apparently, refurb items from Nagenast who are very well regarded in the owner community are £700 a corner.

Tyres not as expensive as people make out if you shop around, I got all four corners done for £950 on Michelin PS4S (305 rear and 245 Front)

Now the big one. Upper ball joints, or specifically the upper suspension arms. These are no longer available from Audi, you have to swap for V10 items, which means changing the hubs from and rear as well as the lower arms, all in from memory this is at least a £5k parts bill, but again there is a refurb solution that even Ricky at REPerformance is happy with, VPS will sell you a refurb V8 upper and lower arm set for £2k, it's not cheap but much cheaper than the swap over, and actually at £500 a corner for fresh upper and lower arms with all new ball joints and bushes represents pretty good value.

Buy on condition and history, if it feels off, walk away, get an inspection by a specialist, Ricky at RE basically wrote the book on these but as he is in Swindon it can be tricky to get to them. Other specialists are out there, mine is Quattro Tech. Audi will do an inspection for you as well just be sure to use the RS dealers. Make sure they are taking covers off and also make sure its been jacked up correctly as the flat floor has specific jacking points.
