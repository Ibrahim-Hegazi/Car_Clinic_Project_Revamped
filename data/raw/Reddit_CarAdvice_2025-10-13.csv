1o54hm5,"Is this a battery, alternator, or catalytic converter issue? (2019 Subaru)","We’ve been having to jump our Subaru very often for the past few months. Like 75% of the time, i’d say.

No check engine lights, etc., but for the last week or so it’s been smelling like rotten eggs in the car. We assumed it was roadkill or food that we couldn’t find. Yesterday, the battery was super dead. No lights/sounds at all when putting in the key. We tried to jump it and nothing. Google said it could be a bunch of issues, including the catalytic converter and alternator.

Then try putting it in gear (with engine running) if you now can't because clutch isn't released it's a bad clutch master.

You could checks the clutch pedal adjustment. Mostly for pedal-free play. But also pedal height. But this should only need adjustment when the clutch master, clutch pedal, or maybe on some cars clutch switch for cruise control was replaced.

If you're feeling froggy you can replace the wheel cylinders, the shop you go to would have told you they were leaking so they're probably fine. Sometimes when you are taking them apart you can knock one of the cylinders out if you aren't careful and you'd have to put it back together and bleed the brakes if that happens.

You will have to adjust them when you are done, you want to adjust them where they have a light drag. Using your parking brake often should keep them adjusted.

They plug their scanner in. Then proceed to point out minor defects and offer me half the asking price. 

Turn my Honda accord back on, it has the VSA light, brake check light (triangle with !) check engine light PO108, manifold absolute pressure barometric high pressure circuit. It’s shifting weird and won’t shift above 40mph. It’s totally messed up. 

I unplug battery, erase all obd engine codes TCM and ECM codes with scanner at auto zone.

The lights are still on.

1. Can you even do this with a scanner the sketchy dude plugged in? Did I get scammed by the sketch ball?

2. How do I fix it?I drove around like 10 miles after I erased the check engine codes and the ECM + TCM at auto zone. Do I need a better scanner

So last Thursday I while parking my car suddenly stalled and the clutch pedal went (without resistance) right to the floor and wouldn’t come back up on its own. I was also completely unable to engage the clutch and put the float in any fear. I was suspecting master cylinder and this was confirmed by the roadside mechanic and recovery who came to tow car back to my home. As it’s a relatively simple part to access I opted to carry it out myself. 

I replaced the master cylinder and attempted to bleed the clutch, keeping the brake/clutch fluid reservoir topped up, feeding it over a litre of brake fluid! I have been pumping the pedal with the line in normal position and then after roughly 20 pups I move it to bleed, watch the bubbles go up my bleed pipe (started as more then got less with each attempt). I attempted this over and over again for over an hour, but there is still no pressure in the clutch system and the pedal remains on the ground with no resistance. 

Was the roadside mechanic wrong and there’s a different issue, or am I just stupid and not bleeding it correctly?",1,1760300578.0,2,MechanicAdvice,1760383989,2025-10-12 20:22:58,2025-10-13 19:33:09,"wpmason (Score: 1): It could be the master, the slave, or the hose.

1o4zbb9,Coolant confusion - which kind should I use?,"Hey guys, I’ve been trying to figure out which coolant I want to put in my Lancer SE and I’ve come to a crossroads. I bought my Lancer from a dealership and have a warranty through the dealership itself for engine, drivetrain and transmission so I wanna make sure I get the right stuff. The engine in the car is the 2.0L 4B11 - naturally aspirated.

Starting off, the coolant that is currently in it is blue. I have no idea the brand since I bought it second hand. I plan on flushing out the system and replacing it fully.

The manual recommends “long life hybrid organic acid technology” which I’m guessing is P-HOAT (if I’m wrong I’m hoping someone can correct me). I’ve already bought some PEAK Asian blue coolant that says it is good for a 2017 Lancer but it seems to be a POAT coolant. My first question would be, would this be a suitable replacement even though it’s POAT?

Second question, besides the PEAK coolant, what else would be a good replacement? I’ve seen some Pentofrost A3 which is blue for Asian vehicles and it is P-HOAT/phosphate HOAT (I’m guessing they are the same thing). There is also Zerex coolant but many websites say that it won’t work in it unless it is the green variant (no difference between the colors in my research). Should I stick with something that strictly says P-HOAT or can I go with anything that says it is compatible regardless of composition?

The vent pipe goes straight into the intake pipe before the turbo, so you can check that at the same time for any excessive oil running out of it, but it’s difficult to diagnose the pcv system as a DIY job without the engine running. The valve is built into the cam cover and cannot be replaced separately. 

I’ve seen more turbo failures than crankcase ventilation failures on these engines by a factor of about 10, so that is where I’d start. The carbon buildup in the manifold will also trap oil, making it appear possibly worse than it actually is.

I've already driven upwards of 500km with it, and have only noticed two differences:

- upwards of 110km/h, it seems to have a bit less power than before. Can still make it up to 130-140 but need to be a bit more patient
- pushing it more (upwards of 2000rpm, higher speeds) causes a whistling noise

2. Drained coolant and it’s brown and less than 0.5 gallons came out(I flushed it myself 1 yr and 10k miles ago and it takes \~2 gallons IIRC). Also replaced radiator cap at that time
3. Minor abnormalities on the bottom of the oil fill cap (condensation).
4. Tons of gunk under radiator cap
5. Compression test results. All cylinders read between 120-150psi except for one which was around 90psi.

Yeah so, I'm out about 105k and decided to change my spark plugs. I knew the engine cover valve gasket was leaking at the corner that meets the timing belt part, but I was surprised to find out that there was a lot of oil in my spark plug wells also. So I vacuumed that out. 

Replaced the ignition coil with QYL , valve cover was just some cheap offbrand with quick delivery. Gasket appears to be seated correctly, I see no evidence of it expanded or squished out. 
I did use a line of permatez ultra black on the two corners. 
I did scrape...and scrape, aaaand scrape, the old gasket off so I had a flush surface, scrubbed down with Brakleen and a Scott shop towel. It was very dirty and crusty everywhere, plenty of rubber gasket was stuck on, but I finally got it clean. 

New spark plugs are acdelco OEMs . 

I did everything hand tight, then a half then or so beyond that with a 1/4"" ratchet.


I'm not sure what's happened, as I figured if I have a problem, it'll be from not correctly tightening something up top or messing up the gasket....but there was smoke billowing out from below the valve cover, where it becomes metal again.

Hi folks,

I was doing an oil change myself and made a rookie mistake. I drained the oil, cleaned everything, installed a new filter, and then started tightening the bolts to the specified torque. I set the torque wrench to 20 Nm and reinstalled the drain bolt along with the three bolts for the oil filter cover.

Everything went fine until two bolts on the oil filter cover **snapped**. I was really confused, so I checked the torque wrench again — it was showing bit less than 20 Nm. I couldn’t understand how that happened. Was my torque wrench damaged and not applying the proper force?

I went back to the manual and realized that 20 Nm is the correct torque for the **drain bolt**, but the **oil filter cover** should only be tightened to **10 Nm**.

A small bit of each broken bolt is still sticking out, about 1 millimeter, but I can’t get a grip on them with regular pliers. Now I’m trying to figure out the **safest way to remove the broken bolts** without damaging the aluminum casing.

Unfortunately, getting the scooter to a mechanic isn’t easy — no nearby shop and **towing is expensive** (high labour cost country) — so I’d like to try everything I safely can myself first, **even buying a welding machine**.

I’ve done some research and found a few potential options:

AFAIK best way:

* **Welding a nut** onto the remaining bolt to twist it out.
* **Left-hand drill bits** or screw extractors (though I’ve heard they can be risky).

Easier ways (not sure if it will work, anyone has experience?):

* Trying to grab it with Vise locking pliers
* **Super glue + nut** idea (as a lower-heat version of welding). **-** would glue be strong enough get a bit more of the bolt out before I can apply pliers?

👉 **Questions:**

* Any chance super glue could hold enough torque to turn it?
* How can I prevent further damage to the aluminum case?

Of course if nothing would work I would tow it to the mechanic, but want to omit that if possible.

Thanks in advance — any experience or creative suggestions would be appreciated! 🙏

Anything that is going to drastically change the breathing of the engine requires a tune.

For I/H/E, if you plan on doing all of them a tune could wait until you get all the parts in. Just doing the intake alone does not warrant a tune. It's mostly for when you remove the cat you gain a ton of flow and you def need a tune for that. Just an intake and a cat back, i wouldn't even bother.

My car was stolen from my buisness in broad daylight and yes I’m dumb and was running late to work so I stupidly left the keys in the car, unlocked, and my purse in the car with my wallet too. I tracked the car and it says it’s in an apartment garage, the cops drove by but there’s nothing they can do without probable cause. So we gave them the spare key and it isn’t responding to the key fab. Is there something these thieves could’ve done to affect the car from reacting to my fab now? Also what other advice can you give me on what to do to get it back because it’s a 2022 Range Rover so they knew to steal it I’m guessing because the mirrors fold in only when it’s locked.

Some things you can check are:

1. Is the air conditioning working properly?

2. Is the the air conditioning draining its condensation outside the vehicle? (usually passenger side near the front wheel) Sometimes the a/c drains become clogged with leaves and dirt - the water will sometimes pool on the passenger side floorboard and make the carpet wet.

3. A less likely scenario is that the heater core is leaking coolant, but that would come with the smell of coolant inside the cabin along with a greasy film on the inside of the windshield that is hard to clean off. It would also happen anytime the heat is on the windshield.

Cuteslave07 (Score: 1): Oof, welcome back from vacation your truck clearly didn’t miss you. That smart key system malfunction paired with the chainsaw noise is rough. If the dash lights come on but it’s not cranking properly, you’re probably looking at either a dead starter, low voltage issue, or something funky with the immobilizer system. The chainsaw-type noise could be the starter motor trying but failing to engage properly sometimes that happens if the battery’s weak even if lights still come on. Try jumping it first, just to rule that out seen weirder stuff with newer systems. If it still acts up, next check would be the starter or the smart key module itself throwing a tantrum.

Honestly, with all these electronics tied together now, one thing failing can mess up 3 other systems. This is where it starts getting expensive fast. Not to plug anything, but I had something very similar happen after a road trip and ended up using CarShield.

Last spring, with about 52,000 miles on the rig, I pulled out of my ""camping"" spot, fueled up right next door, and as I accelerated on to the interstate, the check engine light came on.  I freaked, (I'm ""mechanically declined""), pulled over, shut off the engine, and collected myself.  A few minutes later I fired it up and the engine light was off.  I've driven it about 1,000 miles since, no problems.  Today. . . I got out of my campsite, drove about 40 miles, fueled up, and as I was accelerating on to the interstate, the engine light came on again.  I pulled over, shut it off and waited a few minutes, fired it up, and the light was still on.  So I grabbed my $20 Amazon code reader, and it came up with the code in the title.  I cleared the code, continued on my way, and drove an additional 200+ miles with a near constant eye on the dash gauges and warning lights, and there was no recurrence.  I've googled the code, and there are plenty of problems to choose from, lol.  Both incidents were within a mile of fueling up, while accelerating to highway speed.

1o54hrq,Shifting Struggles after Drain and Fill (Auto Trans),"My 2003 Infiniti FX (Yes, 5-Speed Auto Transmission, NOT CVT) is really struggling to shift after I replaced the radiator (and thus had a drain and fill on the ATF since all the transmission fluid came out). Additionally, the ""AT CHECK"" light flashes at startup. I refilled the transmission to spec, but it is really struggling to shift. It'll go into park, reverse, and neutral just fine, but drive is a different story. 

Immediately after I finished the job, it would shift between 1-2-3 just fine, but wouldn't go into 4-5, but since then the situation has deteriorated and now it seems to be stuck in 2nd. It'll still do reverse, neutral, and park, but when you go into drive, it'll only go in 2nd. Fluid levels are still fine, and the transmission has shown no signs of stress beforehand; It's been running great (and yes, the old fluid was clean and the new fluid is to spec). I cannot figure out why a drain and fill is having this issue. 

What I've done so far:

\- Gone through all gears in tiptronic mode (has no effect, screen readout shows that the computer thinks we're shifting gears, but the car stays stuck in neutral with seemingly no attempt to shift at all)

\- Triple checked fluid levels (dipstick reads slightly above median, but still within safe zone)

\- Battery disconnection for computer reset (at first it seemed to be a computer issue. When I did this, the car stopped shifting from 1-2-3 and stayed stuck in 2nd.)

\- Checked for leaks. No leaks are happening, and the fluid is clearly flowing to the radiator as one line is much warmer than the other line. 

  
Anyone have any idea why this could be happening? I'm at a total loss right now.

Things that are over-complicated tend to be less reliable and more expensive to repair. Sometimes even more expensive to maintain. 

So sure, they’ll get better gas mileage while still feeling zippy… but they lack towing capacity on larger trucks and SUVs. But it doesn’t necessarily help the consumer if they require premium fuel to run properly and cost of ownership is higher than a more simple design. 

And I care about the environment. I just think tailpipe emissions are a drop in the bucket… there are much bigger fish to fry if we’re really trying to protect the earth. 

If a 2.0L Turbo in a pickup truck proves to be unreliable, just how much carbon is going into manufacturing more and more trucks to replace all the dead ones that get thrown away because of an unreliable engine? 

There’s no actual logic to it. It’s all just performative. 

Maybe they’re good, maybe they’re bad… But cars and trucks didn’t used to be this disposable. And that’s arguably worse than the tailpipe emissions.

1o50rdk,Dealership made a big mistake,"Hi all! Need some advice/information from anyone who is a mechanic (especially at a dealership) that knows more about this than me. So I have a brand new 2025 Nissan rogue that I bought from a Nissan dealership on July 1. I was lucky enough to get the 0% APR Cause I’m a broke college student that needs a dependable vehicle. I just hit 5000 miles earlier this week and had a scheduled appointment at the dealership for my first maintenance visit. Drove to the dealership and the car was in perfect condition, they did an inspection and everything passed. They did the oil change and as soon as I left the dealership and got on the interstate I noticed my car lurching a little bit. I figured maybe the oil hasn’t circulated through correctly yet so I pulled over,revved it a little bit,and turned it off and back on and it seemed to be fine. I drove 20 minutes home after that with no issues. Later that evening, I was driving to a friend’s house and I noticed that there was light gray smoke, bellowing from my exhaust (so much that I couldn’t see behind me). So I pulled over and popped the hood, checked out all my fluids, and they seemed fine including the oil but I couldn’t tell the exact reading on that, but there was definitely oil. I turned my car back on, and my power steering light flashed, and the car shook, that’s when my check engine light and oil light came on. I had the car towed to the dealership but am kinda worried about what the outcome would be long term. Wouldn’t be surprised if they claimed to fixed whatever it is but it leads to a long term issue that doesn’t pop up until my car isn’t under warranty anymore. I’ve been doing some research on what it possibly could’ve been and I’ve been hearing a lot about the oil being overfilled or being the wrong kind. Currently I’m leaning more on the side of the oil level being filled way too much just based on the symptoms. Anybody have a better guess on what it could be? Also does anyone have any experience with how dealerships would deal with something like this? This is a brand new car and Thus a brand new engine, even if they fix the issue there can’t be a guarantee that this won’t cause something further down the line, or maybe enough damage has already been done.

I have a 2020 Ford F150 with 160,000 miles. I went to a mechanic in the end of June because check engine light was on. Truck was giving code for catalytic converters and so our vehicle wouldn't pass inspection which was due at that time. He put both catalytic converters on the vehicle (front and back). The check engine light was still on after this. He continued to reset the code telling us to drive around. This happened numerous times over a three month period all while he had my vehicle for weeks at a time while he was trying to ""fix"" it. Supposedly the first cat was bad so he replaced it. Then he told us it was the turbo and not just the cats so he replaced the turbo and the passenger cat the third time (last time it could be warrantied). We still have a vehicle with a check engine light after a couple months of dealing with this. We are getting code P0420 (Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold Bank 1). I spoke to two other mechanics that both said you need to put FORD cats on the truck because the aftermarket cats aren't going to work on my vehicle. The second mechanic explained that my vehicle is CARB-compliant and so you can't use federal compliant catalytic converts on it. I did get under the truck to take photos of the cats to see if they were CARB-compliant. I see the ""FED"" on the catalytic converter so I'm assuming it's federal complaint and not CARB-complaint. I can't tell on the driver's side catalytic converter though. Can anyone here tell me if they driver's side cat is also federal-compliant?  Meanwhile, the mechanic that did this work on our vehicle refuses to return any phone calls and has blocked my husband on text messages. My question would be is it against the law to install federal compliant cats on a vehicle that is CARB complaint (it's clearly stated on a tag on the hood of the vehicle). At this point, I'm so frustrated over this whole situation and living in the State of NC, I now have a vehicle that won't pass inspection after spending thousands of dollars to get it ""fixed"".

It is possible for a bad turbo to dump oil into a catalytic converter and destroy it.  

The downstream O2 sensor is what causes this code to come up. It is the last check in the emission system. If anything is wrong before that sensor you will get a P0420 code. 

I had a car that would throw this code if the air filter was dirty. 

You need to find a competent mechanic that can use real time diagnostics on their reader and determine the actual problem.

1o4vkua,Help Diagnosing Gearbox / Diff noise,"Hi all,

I'm hoping someone can help us. To start, we acknowledge we are 'cowboys' / home DIY mechanics, so if this is simple / obvious, sorry..

Car: UK 2013 VW UP Manual

We recently changed the clutch (days ago) as this was warn. No issues seemed to come from this (that we noted during the disassembly / install) but when we started testing it we did have issues with the clutch pedal (either staying down or becoming stiff and not being able to move)  
This ended up being the slave cylinder, so we changes this and bleed the clutch and all seemed good.

Now, we're noticing this noise when the car is driving the wheels or the wheels are being rotated (As heard in the video, the almost crunching noise happening 1 / 2 times a second). We've confirmed the noise does not occur when in neutral, or in a gear but with the clutch depressed. When driving, if we go into neutral, the noise stays as long as the car is rolling / the wheels are rotating.

If we rotate the wheels by hand, we can't hear this, but we are assuming its because we cannot put enough speed in to cause the noise. The noise is quite evidently coming from the gearbox. This is a FWD car so its hard to tell if its from the 'actual' gearbox or diff.

For reference, when we changed the clutch, we drained the gearbox and removed the driveshafts. When reassembling, we added around 1.3L to 1.4L of oil back in. We had some concerns this noise came from potentially ""overfill"" so we removed around  300mL but this made no difference / made it worse.

Current working theory is diff input bearing or some kind of bearing between gearbox and diff may have gone (maybe due to over oiling or under oiling.. we don't have a great reference on the 'correct' amount of oil) but we're not sure how to test or prove this, and want to avoid testing by replacing if possible.

Again, we're cowboys just trying to learn. Any help, theories, ideas, tests we could do or just anything really would be much appreciated.

Thanks

Hey everyone,
I’m dealing with a frustrating situation right now and could use some insight.

I have a **2014 Hyundai Elantra** with **125k miles**. Yesterday, while doing Amazon Flex deliveries, my car suddenly stopped moving in *Drive* — it revs up but doesn’t go anywhere. However, it still goes in *Reverse*. After trying to move it again, the **check engine light** came on and I got a **P0722 code** (output speed sensor).

Here’s the part that’s bugging me:
A few months ago, when I hit around **100k miles**, I made a post on here asking what maintenance I should do. A few people mentioned changing the **transmission fluid**, but when I went to my mechanic, he said it *wasn’t necessary*. So I skipped it.

Now, after what happened yesterday, I can’t help but wonder — **if I had changed my transmission fluid back then, could this have been prevented?**

For context, I mostly use my car for **Amazon Flex**, which means a lot of **constant stops and starts**. I’m starting to think that may have put extra wear on the transmission.

Would love to hear from anyone with similar experiences or any Hyundai techs who know if skipping a fluid change could’ve contributed to this issue.

Yes I can jack it up and put axle stands on all 4 points, but the max height you can get is limited to 30/40cm and thats obviously not from the bottom of the wheel so you're actually losing a bit of height by standing on the frame as opposed to the wheel.

There are always ramps, but again only roughly 30cm and whilst that is better because you also get to keep the wheel clearance, ideally I would love to have more space.

Mechanically the car is in good shape, she keeps up the maintenance, oil changes, etc. These days, her commute about 3 miles each way plus grocery & Target runs once or twice a week, maybe 50 miles total a week.  Because her budget is tight, she wants to keep this car for as long as possible. I could see it easily going another 5 years the way she drives.

I was getting my car ready for winter and while removing a wheel, my jack failed, causing the car to drop onto the rotor on the concrete tiles. The only point of contact was the rotor.

1o4iof3,"2018 Toyota Corolla SE AC Dies After 5 Mins at Idle/Low Speed, Works Perfectly on Highway. Why?","I hope to have provided as much details as needed below.
I will be grateful if anyone could find the issue causing this. Thanks!

So I recently hit a significant pothole on the highway (adaptive cruise control is now throwing an ""unavailable"" warning, but that's a secondary issue for now). The day after the impact, my A/C changed its behavior drastically.

The Symptoms:

1. At Idle / Low Speed: The A/C blows cool air perfectly for about five minutes. After that, the cold air suddenly stops, and it continuously blows ambient air.
2. To get cold air back at idle: I have to turn the A/C system off for a few minutes, then turn it back on, which restarts the 5-minute cold cycle.
3. Cooling fan starts when AC is turned on and keeps spinning fast for 5 minutes then enters low speed mode. Bear in mind that before I hit that pothole the cooling fan would cycle on and off when at idle and the AC would cool properly and consistently.
4. Now whenever I switch the AC on when idling the RPMs drop below 500 for a split second then stabilize.

This problem doesn’t happen when I'm driving at highway speeds. The A/C blows continuously cold and strong on the highway.

Here's the things I did when the issue arose the next day:

• Checked refrigerant level and it's good
•Checked my coolant level. It's good
• Checked all fuses in the cabin and the engine bay fuse box and they are good and not blown
• Checked all relays and they're good. I even switched the compressor magnetic clutch relay with the horn one to make sure it's not faulty and both are good
• I sprayed my condenser and radiator grills with a solution of warm water/soap and vinegar in case the condenser was clogged with road debris and bugs then I rinsed everything thoroughly. Clean as a whistle
•I changed my battery for a brand new one and tested voltage. (12.63V when car is completely off then 13.66V when car is on with all accessories on including high beams and AC)
•I visually checked AC lines for any bending or looseness in case the pothole impact did comprise them. Nothing. They're intact.

1o4xxj8,Bought a CPO Tesla — just discovered two doors were resprayed. What are my options?,"Hi everyone,

I bought a Certified Pre-Owned Tesla online 13 days ago and collected it eight days ago. The car drives beautifully and I genuinely love it — but I’ve since discovered signs that both doors on the left side were resprayed, even though I was assured before purchase that the car had never been repaired. I’m now wondering if I should return it under the 14-day distance purchase period.

Before placing the order, I phoned the sales assistant to confirm whether the car had ever been repaired, as I was deciding between this and another vehicle at the same branch. I was told it hadn’t. At collection, I noticed both left-side tyres were brand new, which seemed odd (typically you’d replace tyres on the same axle). I asked again if the car had been repaired and was told no.

On closer inspection this week, I found paint drips on the front passenger door handle and paint overspray on the black window trim of the rear left door. These suggest both doors were resprayed.

I did my best to inspect the car at collection, but after three train cancellations and a six-hour journey, I was exhausted and just wanted to get home with my new car.

Imagine some here will say to return the Tesla and get a proper car, but can others advise how Tesla handles returns in this situation?

Will the 500 miles affect my right to return it under the 14-day window?

V40 is more or less identical up front, but the doors are much thinner. Boot space is adequate for small families. 

I thought the seats in the C30 were more comfortable overall, and the facelift versions after 2010 slightly more attractive.

Petrol engines on the C30 tended to be not terribly efficient and not massive on power (I think about 140/150bhp, which is fine). V40 petrols tended to hit the defined T2-T5 badging scheme, from 120bhp, increasing in about 30bhp increments, although this depends on the age of the car.

1o4svdd,Is the Vauxhall Mokka really that bad?,"Boyfriend spent the weekend driving one around and he really liked it. We’re looking for a new car at the moment as the last one died. The Mokka was a 25 plate so more modern than what he was used to and he loved it. Loved the sensors, CarPlay, and everything else. I know it’s fairly standard now, but his last car was 2008 and the last was even older. Mokka also gave him the confidence to drive an SUV.

Looked on here though and people have nothing but negative things to say. Mostly that it’s boring and Vauxhall is far from a reputable manufacturer. I will say, however, that the car definitely wasn’t the smoothest drive and the shiny dashboard did my nut in as I was constantly blinded.

Are we better off looking elsewhere?

You can download the VAG app and track when it ends up doing an active regeneration and if that occurs you simply keep the engine running for 15-20mins. I think the DPF issues are overstated especially in the VAG 2.0 TDI due to how it actively regenerates when the DPF is full. The fuel economy is also better in the 2.0 TDI.

I’ve attached a google image of the car on the post as I can’t find any recent ones I’ve taken.

Anyway back to the story…

Not long after my dad recruited their baby sitting and whilst parked at our house my dad managed to reverse into the Fusion.

The boot didn’t open to begin with but after that was fixed the button in the dash board no longer worked to open the boot. It’s now key only and there is no boot popper button in the boot itself.

I am now in line to inherit this car as my Grandma has stopped driving, and was hoping to try and resolve this.

Wondering if anyone had any ideas on how to fix it, or if they knew a way I could retrofit a boot popper onto the actual boot panel - I am worried about leaking/rust though, could I put a button in place of the key hole? 

The reason I’ve come here to ask as from my understanding this vehicle is 1 of 1 in the country, so any parts that are native for the vehicle will have to be ordered in. Unless it’s a generic ford part there is no chance of finding one in a scrap yard.

With cars at this age what you're looking for is the MOT and service history. Mileage doesn't really enter into the equation except in the case of being really low - something that's done less than around 5k a year has spent a lot of time sat parked and cars don't like that. 


Look for a full service history from the same garage or mechanic, and look at the last couple of MOTs for any corrosion or rust warnings, as well as any oil leakage. When viewing the car, check underneath as much as possible for rust or corrosion.


Outside the cars you've looked at, consider Seat Ibiza or Skoda Fabia.

Other than that it seems a perfect little car for driving to work and back with plenty of service history and receipts owned by an old couple from new by the looks of it then apparently used by a local mechanics wife for a couple of years (the guy selling it used to buy and sell but just takes the occasional one now he’s retired and brought it from the old couple, sold it to the mechanic then had it back off him when he upgraded a few weeks ago) 

All in all, does this seem like a reasonable buy and is there anything else I should check for/enquire about?

To me that, along with the other issues you mentioned make it sound like the car has been driven harshly or not been well cared for which is a red flag for me

1o4jq0j,Is it worth buying warranty for 2019 BMW 330e petrol plugin hybrid?,Basically that's the question.

I would wager that 2019 isn’t that old and going off some other EVs that have been out longer that generally the sort of batteries that goes into cars are more durable than we are led to believe.

1o4jflo,Seat Arona or Suzuki Vitara?,"After weeks of searching for a used car, I finally got my options down to these two:

1- 2019 Seat Arona Xcellence Lux 1.0 TSI 7-speed DSG (115 HP)

2- 2019 Suzuki Vitara SZ5 1.4 Boosterjet 6-speed TC

Both around the same price and mileage. I really like the interior and comfort of Arona over Vitara.
But my main concerns with Arona is that it only comes with 1 year warranty, and it has a dry timing belt. Whereas Vitara still has the remainder of 10 years warranty, and it has a timing chain which are supposedly immortal. But the infotainment and the interior of Vitara is quite outdated. Another slight concern about Arona is the engine power when overtaking or when carrying our camping stuff around.

Are these concerns valid? What would you go for between these two?",0,1760256500.0,2,CartalkUK,1760383989,2025-10-12 08:08:20,2025-10-13 19:33:09,"blackreaver (Score: 2): Haven't driven the Arona but have the Vitara.


1.4 Boosterjet has decent power, plenty for overtaking. I get about 48mpg average in the 1.4 129 mild hybrid which is really good. Mild hybrid also has regenerative braking which makes it easy to drive and less wear on brakes.
Interior and boot really spacious for size of car. Supposed to be very reliable, haven't had any issues so far.


Downsides, bit of body roll in corners, infotainment system is a bit dated and doors/boot can feel a bit cheap when you shut them.


All round decent car, would buy again.

Grahamr1234 (Score: 1): I had the Arona as a hire car for a few days. 1.0TSI FR version.

It was alright, but the engine was very lackluster once you tried to get onto the power. Everything else was okay in it.

Can't comment on the Vitara as I've never driven one, but I would have thought the Vitara might have the better engine of the two."

bourton-north (Score: 38): The key question is what kind of driving you will do. If you will charge at home every day, and do short trips under 20 miles a lot then it might be worth it. If you aren’t doing much of that or not charging at home you’d be better off getting a simpler petrol car and just using it normally. Less complicated, less to go wrong.

roger_rabbit_71 (Score: 41): I've had a 21 plate 530e for 6 months with similar mileage. Unbelievably smooth drive due to the hybrid drive. Hybrid system has a 10 year BMW warranty which includes battery replacement if it drops below a certain capacity level (80% from memory) so longevity shouldn't be a huge concern. It makes sense to charge it at home though - I charge overnight on octopus go. The 3 pin outlet fully charges in 5 hours and gets 22-30 miles depending on driving style/temp etc. Doing a long run with a full charges will get me 80+ mpg. The same without charging gets me 40mpg for mixed driving, nearer 50mpg on a run. Coincidentally my dad has the new 530e and we agree the quality has dropped and the 2021 models were much nicer to drive and to be in. Hope this helps, I don't have any regrets (fucking love the car)"
