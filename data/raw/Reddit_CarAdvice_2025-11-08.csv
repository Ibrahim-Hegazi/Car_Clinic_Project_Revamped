The key I have looks totally normal, and I have a keyfob that locks/unlocks doors. The clicking in the video is coming from the fuel pump relay most noticeably, and another quieter clicking somewhere down in the back middle or lower part of the engine bay as well. I can hear it down by the fuel tank / fuel pump as well, but I'm assuming that's just from reverberation because it's quieter.

**Vehicle details: 1999 Ford Ranger XLT 4.0L V6 4x4,143k miles.** I'm the 3rd owner. Previous owner had a few vehicles and didn't drive it as a daily.

Driving history/initial indicators:

Test drive went great, no issues. Took it to a mechanic for a pre-sale inspection and he said it was in good shape outside of a valve cover leak and front cover crank seal leak. There's definitely an oil leak with a mix of old and new oil covering the bottom half of the engine, but when parked in the driveway overnight after driving for a while there were two drips about the size of a dime.

Drove daily for a week. I noticed a few days after purchasing that it would take a few seconds to turn over when I first started it up... ""rer rer rer rer"" Then it drove fine and started up fine the rest of the day.

Five days ago I try to start it (I had driven it an hour prior) and it turns over but then cycles high rpm, then low rpm, then high rpm, then low rpm and then stalls. The lights in the video come on. I think ""not ideal"" but I try again, same thing. Try one more time and it turns over and runs fine. I probably should've dealt with it then but I've been exceptionally busy so I figured very light use for a week or two would be fine given that was the only time that happened.

Then three days ago I'm driving, about a 15 minute drive, and it dies mid-drive. I try to start again and it's struggling. Try a couple more times and it starts up and I'm able to get it out of the middle of the intersection to the side of the road before it dies again - power steering, brakes, etc. I had it towed back to my place where I've been doing my best to figure it out but I'm a bit overwhelmed. More complicated diagnosis than I was hoping for my first DIY attempt.

**Here's what I've investigated:**

Used a circuit tester - all circuits are working fine both under the hood and by the driver's side door. I visually inspected a handful as well, no issues.

Ran an OBD II diagnostic with the key in ""ON"" position using Forscan (obviously can't scan with the engine running). It came back with a number of codes but I'm unsure which of these are actually active and which are historic and were never cleared. The guy I bought it from mentioned he'd fixed a couple of things so it's possible he never cleared codes. He's a 50 year auto parts salesman which makes me feel both good, and also slightly scared. Was he a knowledgeable parts guy? Or a ""just weld the hitch to the bumper"" guy? He seemed very nice and trustworthy, and I'm generally a good judge of character but maybe I missed this one... Hoping not.

**Here are the codes that came back:**

PCM P0171 & P0174

PCM 1000

GEM P1808

GEM P1804

GEM B1483

GEM P0500

GEM B1359

ABS C1230

ABS C1102

I'm praying some of these are historic and have been fixed... Given none of the breakers popped in the power distribution box it seems odd all of these circuits would malfunction at once without impacting a single fuse? Or maybe that's naive. My level of knowledge is based on about 1,000 google searches and youtube videos built on a foundation of generally being handy around the house and not being a moron.

I also tested the battery - charge was fine when it died, tow guy checked it and it was right on the money around 12v when he arrived. I'm assuming that means it wasn't an alternator overcharging things?

EDIT TO ADD: Serpentine belt is fine as well. No gauges indicated issues before it died mid-drive, no check engine lights came on. Just died and now this.

Looked at the air filter, looks almost brand new. Checked the connection to the MAF and a few other sensors and they all look fine.

Checked all the fluid levels and condition shortly after getting it, and everything looked fine. Brake fluid was a little dark but not alarming.

So what would you do next? I have a running list of guesses from my internet searching and youtube vids, but I'm kind of paralyzed by what the next best step is going to be. Some of the guesses for the stall + start, rev, stall + fuel mix code lead me to bad fuel pump, clogged fuel filter, vacuum seal issue, bad MAF sensor. But the ticking fuel pump relay and ticking in the engine bay area + the sensor failure codes are making me worry about electrical issues.

I'd really like to figure this out myself if I can, both to save money and also to have some pride in being able to fix something like this, and take the opportunity to learn.

Thanks in advance. Happy to send any other photos or videos that would be helpful. I can try to start the engine again for an example. I didn't include that here because I'm generally trying to avoid doing that too much because I have no idea if it'll make things worse.",1,1762552153.0,3,MechanicAdvice,1762630414,2025-11-07 21:49:13,2025-11-08 19:33:34,"Prescientpedestrian (Score: 2): Sounds like a problem with your anti theft immobilizer.

1or5xbt,Mechanic damaged my car?,I have a 2013 Jeep JK 2 dr sport. I snapped my front drive shaft last year and my oil cooler housing has also been leaking. I recently brought it to the shop to get an aftermarket driveshaft installed (it’s the proper fit for my lift) and replace the oil cooler housing. Received the card yesterday and was driving fine for 10 minutes then I started experiencing what felt like the clutch slipping accompanied my chattering where the whole jeep was rumbling/shaking. It only happens when I get on the accelerator in any gear above 1st. Typically starts to slip and chatter above 2k RPMs. It also doesn’t happen every pull. Probably about 90% of the time. Drove the jeep today as well and again it was fine for the first 15 minutes before the issue arose again. Also worth noting that my clutch isn’t biting as hard when I got it back from the shop. Mechanic test drove with me today and doesn’t seem to know what’s wrong. He doesn’t think it’s the clutch because it’s intermittent and not constant. My personal theory is he got oil down the bellhousing when replacing the oil cooler and the clutch got contaminated with oil. Symptoms only occurred 15 mins after driving because the clutch is virtually unaffected at cool temps when the oil saturated clutch is still hard and as it starts to warm up the clutch and oil start to get hot and get slick. Bringing the jeep in again next week for the mechanic to check things out but he seems hesitant to believe it was caused by his work. Also important to note I got the clutch replaced ~30k miles ago.

Some have a safety switch where the engine won't get a spark if the oil is low. Test this by adding some old oil. If that fixes the problem, drain and fill with new oil.

A dirty air filter can make it run rich, leading to carbon build-up on the plug tip. Clean and gap the plug (most don't need a new one), and if that fixes it, put in a new filter.

The bracket and pins don't technically need to be removed to replace just the brake pads. Just gotta pull the caliper off then remove the pads from the bracket (bare minimum work, I do not recommend pad slapping, especially if hardware is gonna be neglected)

Hard telling what it actually needs, uneven pad wear (between inner and outer pads) can be caused by a few different issues. And you may have only gotten the truck 5k miles ago, but that does not look new, so 5k miles ontop of how many miles where already on it?

The guy put a high stall converter with a shift kit with shorty headers. But everything else is stock. After pulling the tree is has been acting weird. I know it isn't operator error since we used our little 2018 Honda hrv and it never messed up the car. But there was a noticeable knock one day coming from under the cab. It has gone away and has never came back. I put a new fuel filter in. We think it might be the steering column. The truck was in park but it started in reverse and the low/high beam switch only works with wiggling the steering wheel.

I can’t invest another 5k and I’m weary about having someone do it for much cheaper and finding a rebuilt transmission, if this car will countinue to have problems.

find another mechanic too.  everyone has different strengths, and electric may not be one of his.

find out why he knows it's not the battery.  some batteries develop internal shorts and die over a day or two sitting.  these can be confounding because the act of removing and reinstalling the battery may resovle the issue temporarily, as internal debris sloshes around and resettles without the short.

it's pretty cheap/easy to hook up a multimeter to verify a parasitic draw (that's not intermittemt), and then pull fuses one by one to isolate the problem circuit.
if he can't tell you which circuit is the issue, or that they all checked fine, then he hasn't done his due dilligence and either you or him are half-assing with direction or effort.

multimeter test for amp draw on circuits.  if no clear problem circuit, replace the battery and monitor.
if battery is over 3 years old, just start with a new battery and do the multimeter circuit tests.

1or2jfa,Paid someone to do Cv axle.,"I will preface this by saying that I usually do all my own work. Through YouTube there's been nothing I haven't been able to accomplish with my vehicles. 

About 2 months ago I replaced my cv axle on my 2013 Mazda 3. The repair went well until I noticed it was leaking trans fluid. The axle went on easy enough and I couldn't figure out why it was leaking fluid. I also replaced the output shift seal 

I work a demanding on the call job so i broke down and paid a mechanic. He told me the output shift seal was wrong and it would cost 250$. I agreed and then a day later he said the cv axle was wrong. So he gets one from the dealership. All in all it cost me 607$. As long as it didn't leak fluid I was thrilled to pay it. 

The fluid leak was fixed l! Oh how joyous I was. Fast forward a month. I notice a weird clank noise. I also start hearing a grinding. I jack the car up and there is play in the wheel. So I figure it's a bearing. I get the parts and begin to disassemble the car. As I take the wheel off to access the axle nut I notice something is missing. 

The Axle nut is gone. The mechanic never put it back on. I find an extra and slap it on there. All the problems vanished... I'm at a loss for what to do but one thing I'm for sure about is I will go back to doing my own work for now on..

So I ordered a new weatherstripping. Pulled the old one off, cleaned the metal and got rid of any of the old residue. Installed the new one….

I pulled off the new one, and of course the white glue/adhesive pulled out and was all stringy and a mess. 

I reversed it and put it back on. But have I ruined it by seating it, pulling it off, and reseating it, so the white adhesive might have gaps and may not properly seal the trunk anymore?
 Will I need to buy a NEW weatherstrip with the adhesive intact? Leave it as is and hope for the best? Pull it off, put a bead of 3m super weatherstrip adhesive down and have adhesive on top of adhesive?

THere's lots of ways to destroy an engine if you have access to the oil filler cap:

* A handful of fine silica sand or valve-grinding paste mixed into the oil turns the oil into liquid sandpaper. The bearings and journals wipe out in minutes; the engine locks up solid.
* Sugar. It caramelizes, turns into  carbon deposits, clogs oil passages, and seizes the engine. Syrup, honey, or molasses ...  Things like that.
* A cup or two of brake fluid poured  ... eats seals and gaskets within 20–50 miles. Oil pressure drops to zero, bearings spin without lubrication.
* A tube of RTV squeezed into the oil filler clogs the oil pickup screen and pump.  Starves the engine of oil → seizure in under 5 minutes of running.
* Straight bleach or pool chlorine poured in the oil eats aluminum and copper parts, creates massive sludge, and locks the engine.

Open that filler or drain the oil that should tell you by smell.  If it was brake fluid that may have burned up during the drive, so evidence would be minimal.

I'll call myself an experienced amature. No formal training but very handy and have done major amounts of work myself.

I currently have no power steering assist at all and can't figure out the problem.

Initially started as dead spots while turning and quickly became total loss of PS.

My first instinct was to replace power steering pump. Has 250k miles on it and I was in there for a leaking water pump anyway. No big deal. New pump, fluid change and pressure line(old one was locked solid on the old pump and pretty rusty anyway) and a new serpentine belt later I fully expected the problem to be fixed.

No change. I did bench bleed the system and have muscled the wheel and forth a million times. No change. Reservoir is full and not foamy but does have circulation.

Hmm. Thought well maybe the cheap chinesium pump was bad. Swapped in another pump. No change. 

Pulled the return line off the reservoir and looped it into the top and watched it pump. It's definitely moving fluid. Sucked the res down in about 2 seconds if it was not being refilled.

Hail Mary time because now I'm frustrated. New rack goes in along with new steering shaft. This had to be it right. Nothing else left....no change. 0 power assist. Doesn't matter if revs are idle or 5k. It gives nothing.

Am I missing something??? I have looked for pressure sensors but can't find anything. There is a loop for the return line that acts as a cooler and that is the last original price but it looks ok.

In any case. it's time to measure the outlet pressure from the pump.  You will need to rig up an adapter with a pressure gauge and attached it to one of the ends of the pressure line that runs from the pump to the rack.  Either the pump isn't building pressure (yet shows flow, which is possible if the pressure relief valve is wide open) or it is bypassing the rack valving (possibly due to a bad seal in the valve body)."

Most of the oil seems to be concentrated on the front corner of the engine, between the filler cap and the oil filter. The underside of the engine cover is also wet with oil in this exact spot (see more photos in comments).

The upper timing cover is leaking (easy) and likely the cam ladder too, which is not a simple ""valve cover"" job and is fairly involved for someone new to wrenching.  The biggest issue with the cam ladder leaking is it'll burn off as it goes straight to your exhaust manifold, then on the other side it leaks down past the intake manifold and eventually coats your water pump, which will then also leak.  On the back of the cam ladder is your vacuum pump, these can also dump oil.

You're not losing THAT much oil from these leaks, you're adding oil because of consumption.  Search ""Audi VW 2.0 B12 Chemtool piston soak"" and you'll find how to free up those piston rings.

Replace the upper timing cover, do the B12 chemtool piston soak, replace the vac pump or gasket if it's leaking, clean the cam ladder well and monitor it.

I put valve cover in quotes because its not a traditional valve cover. if you were to remove it, your cams would pop out because they don't use traditional camshaft hold downs. the ""PCV"" has a check valve in it which prevents your boost pressure from entering your crankcase. this check valve is known to fail which allows boost pressure in and can blow seals out creating oil leaks. there is a hard plastic hose that runs from the ""PCV"" to the intake manifold. remove it from the intake side and try to blow through and suck through it. you should be able to suck air through it, but it should prevent you from blowing into it. if you get air movement both ways, you need to replace the ""PCV"". It's made by Hengst btw in case you want to buy an OE part without paying OE prices.

  
as far as the piston ring oil consumption issue, my buddy has a 2015 A6 with the same engine. when he bought it (used) it was going through a quart every 300 miles. I told him to drive it like he stole it. beat the hell out of it. the increased cylinder temps and pressures help break up the carbon deposits that are clogging the oil control ring which is the cause of your oil consumption. he has done this for about 6,000 miles and now he's at 900 miles and less than half a quart low. also, don't do your oil changes any later than 5,000 miles. the oil doesn't break down, but you want to remove the carbon deposits."

Thankfully I bought the extended powertrain warranty from the dealership, it is being covered and the dealership is paying the deductible. They’re also giving me a loaner car to drive while it’s repaired.

My question is, how far do I take this? At the moment I’m really pissed and am tempted for them to take this car back (even though I like it). Do I have them pull their service records to see if they knew about the issue? Do I get a lawyer? Do I make them reimburse me for the price I’m paying for their extended warranty?

1oqs9lr,2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee (WK2) - 3.6l - overheating,"I've got a 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee with the 3.6 Pentastar.  130K Miles.  (I know now, I will never buy Stellantis again.  This thing has seriously had 30K in work in the 50,000 miles since I bought it, most of it paid for by warranty company thankfully.)  I'm not the most experience backyard mechanic, but I'm not a total newb either. I've successfully replaced water pumps for example.  But I'm more familiar with older vehicles and Toyotas, and this one is a new experience for me.

Driving home from work on Wednesday and the car overheated suddenly.  I hadn't seen any previous indication of overheating.  Managed to limp to the next exit, and saw that the coolant was low.  Topped it off, but it was still over-heating, so I burped.  And burped.  And burped.  I have one of those ""spill proof"" burping funnels, and once it got to full temperature the funnel, which is probably at least a half gallon/2 liters, overflowed.  A LOT.  Got more antifreeze, did it again, same result except this time I kept it from overflowing.

Tentatively, I think it's a thermostat, but it could also be head gasket or water pump.  (Obviously, hoping for a thermostat!)  Here's why, can anybody check my thinking?

1. I don't think it's a bubble because I burped the crap out of it.
2. I don't think it's a head gasket because nothing happens until it gets to temperature, and then it starts backflow immediately, oils looks fine, and there aren't really any bubbles to speak of in the fluid (which there would be if there was exhaust gas leaking into fluid in head gasket), and there's no sign of running rough.
3. I tend to suspect that the thermostat is only partially opening, or maybe only opening sometimes, because it works fine until it gets to temperature and then suddenly the funnel starts filling up. It seems to be cyclical, with the backflow lasting maybe 10 seconds out of every 30. That to me is much more consistent with a thermostat than anything else.
4. There's also the question of why I was low on fluid.  Could it be that the thermostat stuck and it backflowed out the overflow tube?

Once I burped it again, I did drive it to the auto parts store and back to get a thermostat, which is about 5 miles.  The temperature was still not acting normal but it did manage to avoid overheating too much.  The gauge on the dash was pretty stable until I got home and revved it to 3000RPM for a couple of minutes, at which point it started to go up.  On the road, it was where I would expect it to be (right below the half mark).  In other words... acting like there was a bubble in the coolant system.

Obviously, a thermostat is 2 bolts and ten minutes and $20.  If it's a head gasket, it's probably totaled unless I do it myself.

Thoughts?  Ideas I haven't thought of?  Any diagnostic steps I should take?  I probably have some version of most any tool you can name or would be happy to buy it if I don't.

1or9o4q,Headlight Upgrade for 97 Savana 1500,"(reposted from r/GMC)

1997 GMC Savana 1500 Passenger v8 5.0L

The lights on my van offer poor visibility at dawn/dusk, and are barely better at night. I bought new ""higher"" grade bulbs (pic 3) recently but notice very little difference, if any. As I was looking around for other solutions I discovered that there are two types of headlight configurations made for my vehicle:

* composite, which I currently have (pic 1 & 2)
* sealed beam (pic 4 & 5), which seem to provide significantly better lighting

Initially. I thought I would just buy a new grille that fits the sealed lights, buy new lights, and enjoy better visibility. Then I woke up from my dream, did my research, and surmised that it was going to be much more involved than that. Besides just a difference in form factor, the connectors are very different, and a quick search didn't turn up adapters (though I may have just not been searching for the right thing - I'm learning as I go, if that wasn't already obvious). This brings me to my questions.

1. How feasible is it to make this kind of ""upgrade""? Besides the new grille, are there other parts I need to make this swap? Are there adapters for the connectors, or is there something more involved?
2. Are there other options to upgrade my current lighting situation without changing the grille? Different lamps or better bulbs I should look into?

I can get the new grille from RockAuto for < $120, and the new headlights run upwards of $70.

- Your headlights may have oxidation or deterioration on the silver that reflects the light forward. This is not an uncommon problem overall. 
- It could just be a mediocre design of headlamp. I feel that manufacturers started to compromise light quality with these slim headlights in the late 90s, styling more than the lighting technology could compensate for. But if you’re going to replace any assemblies, yeah might as well go sealed beam given it’s a choice. It would fit the look of your car too.

So it wouldn’t be a lost cause at all.

AAA replaced my battery last week, and in the dark they dropped and lost both side-post battery bolts for my 2005 Sierra. Instead of replacing them properly, the guy just jammed in smaller ones — so the cables keep popping loose like cheap earrings.

No big deal, right? Two bolts. I figured someone in town would have a couple lying around. I hit AutoZone, Advance Auto, O’Reilly’s, and 3 mechanic shops, and a tire place. Every single one said either, “We don’t carry those,” or “We can’t do that without an appointment… next week.”

I tried everything.
💵 “I’ll pay you $100 cash.”
🙄 Nothing.
💵 “Okay, $200 if you just pop two bolts in.”
Still nothing.
Finally I joked, “Alright, $1,000 if you fix it right now,” and the guy dead-seriously said, “We’d still have to make an appointment.”

After two hours of this scavenger hunt, I gave up, walked into Walmart, and found the exact bolts for $2.27 in the automotive aisle. I’m going to install them myself tonight, which should take roughly the same amount of time as opening a bag of chips.

I guess I’m just shocked. I’m a child of the seventies, and back then, if you waved a $200 around, someone would’ve jumped the counter like it was the Price Is Right. Teenagers would’ve fought over who got to do it first. If someone offered me $200 back then to tighten two bolts, I’d have not only fixed it — I’d have polished the terminals, waxed the car, and probably detailed the cupholders, AND got an STD test after going the extra mile.

I’m not mad — just bewildered. Have we really become so appointment-only, insurance-covered, corporate-policy-bound that nobody wants easy cash anymore?

If it's a ""10 second job"" and so easy, why are you going to multiple repair shops to have them do it? Your logic is flawed. 

If someone fucked up the job, it adds risk. The wrong size bolts they added could have fucked up the threads, the bolts in the battery terminals may not be something you can usually just easily buy separately, and 

Lots of shops have a bunch of random bolts laying around, but it time to match them up and figure it out.

There are two noises I consistently hear, and I am really struggling to describe them to a mechanic. Both are sounds that personally I can best describe as ""about to be abducted by aliens,"" so you can see how that might not be useful for diagnosing the actual issue. I'm going to attempt to elaborate on this, but the further explanations might still be bad.

Sound 1: when I am accelerating, there is a sort-of pulsing sound that's a little higher pitched. It's actually sort of like an ambulance siren sound, but less loud and more wind-y sounding? 

Sound 2: when I accelerate/decelerate, there is a sound like a ufo is nearby. Again, really struggling to describe this. Roaring might come the closest?

The first mechanic I brought it to told me that it's a brake issue, despite the pads actually being fine in terms of wear. They said that there's uneven wear that's causing the sound but I'm not fully sure why that would be the case as the brake pads aren't at the point of being replaced regardless of uneven wearing. 

I am in grad school. I make very little money. I do not want to be replacing things that don't need to be replaced, and I think my inability to articulate the actual sound my car is making is hurting me here.

OP, you can see that darker colored circle going all the way around the sidewall of your tire? That is an unmistakable sign that you drove on it while it was flat or severely under inflated and that will cause the tire to get destroyed right where that circle is. Even if it isn't completely destroyed, the sidewall gets more and more thin and the material on the inside of the tire is being grinded off.

And so even if the hole itself can be plugged, it should not be because your tire is highly weakened and dangerous to drive on.

The wheel tilted to the left now and pulled even worse so I decided to just drop it back off and throw my key in the drop box. Get a call at 7:20am the next morning and the guy asks me “what my truck is doing here”. Told him it was worse than when I brought it in and he said they would fix it.

So later that day I go back in and he starts telling me how they put my front tires on the back and that he’s out of adjustment on the left tie rod and that he might need to order adjusters for that?? I asked him if the wheel was straight and he said “straight is different for everyone” 
I’m pretty pissed at this point but he says to drive it and see how it is.
Well what do you know? The wheel is now tilted to the right like it was when I first came in and it pulls to the right. 

This is super frustrating. I booked an appointment with a different shop and if they get it I’m going to demand a refund. 

I’m not sure if they just don’t know what they’re doing or their alignment equipment is just shit? I’ve attached pics of the two sheets and they seem to show that it’s within spec (the one with the -1 5/8in toe is from when I brought it in)

Something to consider before jumping to any further conclusions. 

When changing brake pads, rotors should be replaced with them at the same time. I know some people will argue and say that rotors should be turned or how they get away with pad slap. Rotors just arent built the same way they used to be. They are a throw away item, just like pads, in most cases. 

So if the agreement was for just the pads to be replaced, then the rotors may have a hot spot from the previous pads.

Theres a few things to look out for if you changed the piston head, the piston ring being appropriate for the rod end, for thrust & play prevention - if or you changed as well the connecting rod bearings to the crank shaft with the bearing + clearance for oil lubrication. 

then rings really would determine the over all piston rings can also affect oil pressure, oil by pass & detonation ratio.

The engine had seized up because he didn't check the oil, making the vehicle a total loss. I just gave them the title and they waived all charges and sold it for scrap.

So with all that being said, continue to make payments until it's paid off. The towing company will continue to charge you storage fees until you surrender the title to the car. Once you do that, they'll just sell it off as a junked vehicle. It's a better alternative than paying all of the fees to get it back and then winding up in the same problem again.

The rough idle/engine noise issue could also be due to the valve cover. The spark plugs have seals as well to prevent oil from leaking down into the spark plug wells. If oil is leaking into your spark plug wells, your going to end up with misfires which could explain the engine noise. 

Not saying that will fix your problem 100%, but you definitely need a new valve cover gasket and spark plug tube seals. May solve your issue tho."
1or8ibx,I Do Not Understand This Noise!,"So there is this ""TUG"" noise when you move slowly (1st video) which doesnt sound like that when youre driving at normal speeds, it just sounds like a patch of contact with the brakes.

I suppose you already suspect things like the disk not being straight and you can see the state of the brakes.

But what i dont underatnd is what does that have to do with suspension?

The reasin i ask is because the noise completely disappears when you accelerate or slow down (with brakes or engine brake, noise disappears either way). The noise is there when the balance is neutral, basicaly. It's the reason why i cant reproduce the noise if i lift the car. Taking away weight (accelerate) or adding it (slow down) makes the noise go away.

But there is this high pitched nosie that seems localized (so like the tug) and that seems to be coming from the brake but i dont unserstand why that would make the nosie disappear.

Can anyone explain how a noise that seems to be coming from contact between a moving component and a fixed one would disappear if the suspension moves?

Fine. I paid $170 to tow it to his shop. Then, costs eventually ballooned to $2,200 for extra parts and repairs he ""forgot"" to include. Then one day, he called out of the blue and said that all 4 tires needed to be replaced for $1700, which was not mentioned at the diagnostic. I declined and took the vehicle back when he was done with it.

Lo and behold, 2 days later, it wouldn't start. He quoted me another $1400 to investigate the parasitic drain. Said automotive electrical work was $250/hour, but he'd cut me a deal for $200/hour and it would take 7 hours. After my partner informed him that it was unacceptable that he took our money to service everything but didn't address the primary issue, he ghosted us.

All in, I'm nearly $3,000 out and I don't have a functioning car.

1or4fsp,Is top tier gas with it?,I just bought a new car and I just found out about “top tier” gas. I’ve always just used premium from Circle K though. Is top tier gas actually worth it? Will it make a difference on fuel economy and car health?,20,1762545256.0,83,AskMechanics,1762630414,2025-11-07 19:54:16,2025-11-08 19:33:34,"bradland (Score: 58): First thing to understand is that in the US ""premium"" fuel is no different in quality than ""regular"". The only difference is the octane rating. 

Gasoline is made up of hydrocarbon molecules of various lengths. The ""oct"" in octane means there are eight carbon atoms in the molecule. Heptane has seven carbon atoms. The more carbon atoms there are in the molecule, the more resistant it is to combustion. That might sound backwards — like, wouldn't we want *more* combustion? — but inside your engine, it gets really hot, and we don't want the fuel spontaneously igniting. That's called pre-ignition (if it happens before the spark) and detonation (if it happens after the spark), and it's bad. Like, ""put tiny dents in your piston until it breaks"" bad.

So we've come up with ways to measure gasoline based on its resistance to combustion. Premium is 93 or 91 in the US, depending upon where you live. Regular is 87 *just about* everywhere, but some regions will have 85. These ratings don't actually tell you how much literal octane molecules are in the gas. They only tell you how resistant it is to combustion. Modern gasoline has other additives that increase resistance to combustion, which makes the term ""octane"" a bit of an anachronism... Anyway. We're deep enough down this rabbit hole.

None of this has anything to do with what you'll see advertised as Top Tier, which is a literal trademarked brand name that was created by the fuel industry.

Top Tier fuels include an ""additive package"". This additive package includes detergents that clean your fuel system. It used to be that some stations included this kind of additive in their 91/93 ""premium"" grade fuel. Both Chevron and Shell used to do this. These days, Top Tier stations put the additive in all grades, because running 91/93 in a car that only requires 87 is not only a waste of money, but it can result in unburned hydrocarbons that have to be burned in the catalytic converter, which is (negigibly) harder on that component. It's just a waste on all fronts to require consumers to buy 91/93 just to get the detergent additive.

So is this additive worth it? That kind of depends. Some engines are more prone to the kind of issues that result from dirty fuel systems. Others tend to run clean on their own. If you do run a Top Tier fuel, your fuel system *will* stay cleaner. That's an established fact. The detergent additives do clean injectors and the inside of your combustion chamber. It's just that these components tend to last a very long time even without the detergents. So why should anyone care about a clean combustion chamber and injectors if it's not exactly klling their engine?

Therein lies the rub, and why this question is so hard to answer. It's not a simple, objective matter of ""yes you should"" or ""no you don't need it"". It's nuanced. It's an individual choice.

Present-Delivery4906 (Score: 28): Changing your oil and filter on a regular basis is more important to longevity than fuel. Yes, top tier gas (which is not the same as high octane) will keep your injectors a bit cleaner (due to added detergents) but you can also run a fuel system cleaner through your tank once a year and get nearly the same benefits. It will likely NOT impact your gas mileage in any significant way (having tires under-inflated by 5psi would have a bigger impact.)"

1or3f7r,2016 Kia Sportage - Auto Transmission,"Hi folks, hoping for some help. I have a 2016 Kia Sportage 2.0 CRDI AWD Auto. A few weeks ago I was driving and the car jolted from harsh engine breaking. It seemed to drop a couple of gears. Then it wouldn't shift. Wouldn't shift in manual mode either. It said it was in 4th when in manual mode, but it felt more like 2nd or 3rd as it was at about 2k rpm at 30mph or so. 

Got it home and parked it up and a few days later my mechanic came to get a look. Took it for a drive, with no issue. Just said it shifted a bit rough. He changed the oil and a few days later the same thing happened. Took it to a ""specialist"" who, again, took it for a drive, with no issue. On the way home from the specialist the same thing happened while on the motorway. Loud thud and dropped some gears with harsh engine breaking. Some ""shuddering"" (felt like clutch drops) too when limping home. 

Engine light on with pictured codes.

Specialist saying best bet is to replace all the solenoids (can't remember what collective term he used), filter and oil (£1,500), but this still might not resolve the issue. If it doesn't it's money wasted and I'd be looking at £5,400 for replacing the whole transmission with a reconditioned one. 

I suppose my question is, is anyone aware of this issue with these cars (Hyundai Tucson would be the same platform)? 

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks

Coming the the light I had to smash the brake way harder than normal and it continued to idle at like 1900rpm, wanting to go. When I pulled into the gas station and put it in park the RPM shot up to 3000rpm and I immediately killed the engine. After restart it ran normal. 

The next day I started the car and it ran normal for about 30 minutes before I noticed it happening again, both in drive and in park, and again a restart solved the issue in the moment. 

From the little research I've done my guess is the TPS, maybe the MAF, and maybe the IAC. I say maybe to the IAC because it's only had a rough idle once, though that was recently.

The first thing I would do is look under the car to see if there's any coolant residue, because if it's something like a random radiator fan issue, then it might boil out while you're driving, so you would never see any leaks.


Then I would do a coolant pressure test - that's where you pressurize the system to 15-20 PSI with a pump, and look/listen for leaks.


After that, I would do a combustion gas leak test - that's where you pull air from the radiator through a colored liquid that changes color if it detects combustion gases (aka blown head gasket)."

My first try is change the batter, it was tested by AutoZone, confirm it's death. But the new battery can't get the car started. The fuel pump was replaced two years ago. Four ignition coils and spark plugs was replaced not so long ago. So I don't know what's wrong with it.

Bring to the car shop. Told them everything above. They said they have to run an advanced diagnostic, which is $172. I'm fine with that. Later on, they called back and said the fuel assembly was the issue. I'm surprised because it was replaced 2 years ago ( I check the old invoice, paid \~ $500 for that replacement). and it costs me \~ $1,100 to replace the fuel assembly, plus $172, total is \~ $1k2. 

I feel I was scammed. I don't know how they can diagnose the bad fuel assembly. Do they need to take the whole fuel assembly out of the gas tank to test the pump? If so, why I was double charged for the diagnostic fee ($172) and the labor to replace the pump?

If you question the diagnostic provided, get a second opinion.

But no, you don’t usually need to remove the entire fuel pump assembly from the gas tank just to test the pump on a 2009 Toyota Camry. Most diagnostic tests such as checking fuel pressure, voltage, ground, and pump operation can be done while the pump is still installed. You can use a fuel pressure gauge connected to the fuel rail under the hood to see if the pump is building enough pressure, and you can check for power and ground at the pump’s electrical connector under the rear seat. If voltage and ground are present but the pump doesn’t run or the pressure is too low, that usually confirms the pump itself has failed. Removing the entire assembly is only necessary when you’ve already confirmed the pump is bad and need to replace it.

There are mixed opinions on engine flushes, along with the effects it may cause. Other commenters will point that out.

To clean all the sludge out would be a labour intensive process and will cost a decent amount of money. The cleaning itself may remove all the sludge but the potential damage from running the engine on no oil will not be solved.

If the check engine light is on, I’d suggest identifying what that problem is first (which codes) and address it.

I would also go to an independent shop to have any cleaning or work of this nature done. 

There are other issues that could cause the decreased power and if you are lucky there isn’t significant damage internally to the engine. However If the engine is cooked then you may be looking at considering an entire replacement.

1oqivuh,Should I Switch Trades?,"Hello everyone. I know that this isn't a car related questions, but I'd like to get some outside perspectives/advice. 

I just want to go over my background. I'm currently 23 years old, and I never went to trade school. I originally started working in automotve in August 2023 at a quick lube spot, eventually getting promoted to assistant manager. It was a lot of fun but I ended up leaving because the company was bought out. I ended up going to PepBoys as a lube tech in May 2025. The shop started turning into a circus due to bad management so I left there and got hired at Toyota, as a lube tech. I've been at Toyota since September. So overall, I have a little bit over 2 years in the field, and about 6 months in a real shop environment. 

I'm seriously considering changing trades. It's not so much that I don't like automotive, its just that I don't know if I can see myself doing this for the rest of my life. I feel extremely discouraged, especially at Toyota. The guys in the lube tech department are idiots. They don't have much knowledge on cars, and they don't seem to have an interest in progressing. I try to leave my area as much as possible to hangout with the older guys and learn the trade. Shadowing them, we have conversations about what days are like. From what I've gotten from all of the techs I've worked with is that no one makes hours. I think a good amount for the week is around 30. And those are the numbers in high season, the summertime. I know that once you get your certifications, you make a much higher flag rate, but starting out its pretty low. I'm very worried that if/when I get promoted to main shop, I won't be able to provide for myself. I'm getting older now and really want to move out, and become fully independent and I'm just not sure if this field is going to get me there. I've already worked two jobs for a while to help get some extra money since the lube tech pay just doesn't cover my financial needs. I thought getting into this field I would be able to make a living.t I'm not too sure if that's the case, at least for another few years. I've done construction on the side and really enjoyed that. I liked learning and exploring other trades. I actually had an oppurtunity to become full time in a commerical HVAC business but I wanted to take a final shot with automotive doing Toyota. I don't necessarily want to restart in another trade, but at the same time, I don't have the patience for the slow promotion process of automotive. When I was helping in construction, they threw me right into it, and I was actually making more there then I was as a lube tech. It was a full entry level under the table gig. I know that the other trades have a better starting wage and a pretty linear way of promotion. I just want to get transparent advice on what I should do now.

The shift solenoids are the controlled outputs that direct fluid through the valve body to apply the various friction elements in the transmission to give you your different gear ratios and gears.  Diagnostic process would be to first identify the correct circuits in the wiring harness that correspond to the B solenoid.  It will be two circuits, a power and a control.  The power circuit will most likely be a shared power circuit with the other transmission solenoids.  The control circuit will go to whatever module (computer processor) controls the transmission electronics.  Once those circuits are identified, you'll check them for a short to power, short to ground, or an open circuit (high resistance,broken or extremely corroded wire).  After that you'll measure the internal resistance of the B shift solenoid itself via the connector on the transmission, if the resistance is in specification, then you'll check the ability of the solenoid to work by briefly applying power and ground to the appropriate terminals and listen for the suspect solenoid to ""click"" which identifies that the solenoid functions.  If all those tests are good, then the concern will most likely (but not always) be an internal fault in the controlling module.  If you find a wiring fault, then of course repair the wiring and retest.  If the solenoid does not read the correct resistance at the transmission plug, then you would need to remove the transmission pan and check at the solenoid itself (the internal transmission wiring harness can fail).  If the resistance checks good, but the solenoid doesn't click when power and ground are applied, then the solenoid will have to be replaced (some can be replaced individually, some are only available with the valve body assembly).  Depending on the exact specs for your vehicle, the new solenoid would possibly have to be programmed so the controlling module knows it's expected specifications.  Same would go for changing the whole valve body, some have to be programmed. Lastly if the controlling module is found to be at fault, it will require replacement and programming as directed by your manufacturer.  
I know this is a lot to read, but it's the best information I can give and hope it helps.

It only does that when it’s in high rpm or I give it some gas. I took it in and otw my check engine light flashed for like a minute then was solid. I took it in and they said this at first. I let them get more time on the car and they said the purge valve and all 02 sensors needed to be replaced and it would be 1,692 before taxes. It doesn’t look hard to change those but I feel like there is more wrong with the car. Can anyone help me diagnose it from the description I gave plus the obd scan.

Therefore I'd say it depends how often you want to change your car. If you want a new car every year or two, leasing will probably work out cheaper as new cars depreciate in value so quickly anyway. But if you're not gonna change cars often, then I'd say it comes down to whether you want the experience of a brand new car and take the financial hit, or buy a car that's almost new with only a few thousand miles on the clock but with a significant discount compared to brand new.

I bought a second-hand Peugeot 2008 (2017 reg) back in June from a big dealership/garage. They gave me all the paperwork showing it had recently had an MOT and some work done.

A couple of months later (in August), I found out there actually wasn’t a valid MOT when I bought it. I took it back to the dealership, and they did an MOT on the spot. It felt a bit rushed, but I assumed (naively) that everything was fine — the car passed with no advisories.

Fast forward to this week (November) and I noticed the exhaust was hanging at a weird angle and the car was losing power during acceleration, so I took it back to the same garage. They sent me a video from under the car and I was shocked — the exhaust had completely snapped off because it was rusted through.

They’ve quoted me £800 for a replacement and repair.

I feel like the dealership should pay for this. Surely the rust would have been there back in August when they did the MOT — and even when they first sold me the car? It seems like they sold me a car and then passed its MOT knowing there was already a serious issue developing.

I’m quite new to driving and owning a car, so I’m not sure what my rights are in this situation.

Edit:

There is a principle of insurable interest - the legal requirement that a policyholder must have a financial stake in the item or person being insured, meaning they would suffer a financial loss if it were damaged or lost. Without this interest, an insurance contract is void, as it prevents people from profiting from insurance policies on property or lives they don't have a legitimate relationship with. This principle is fundamental to insurance law and helps distinguish it from gambling. 
Key aspects of the principle
Financial stake: The insured must have a financial or legal relationship with the subject of the insurance, such as a property owner or a life insurance policyholder.
 If the insured item is damaged or destroyed, the policyholder must be able to demonstrate that they would suffer a direct financial loss."

1oqxoz0,M4 Vibration After Diff Bush Replacement – Looking for Advice,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for some advice regarding my BMW M4. Earlier this year I had the front and rear differential bushes replaced, and since then I’ve noticed a vibration from the rear at higher speeds. I’ve had the wheels balanced and the car inspected by a couple of independent BMW specialists, both of whom pointed to possible damage to the propshaft around the diff connection area. One of them also noted that the cement nut may have been reused.

The car is currently back at the garage that carried out the work, but they’ve suggested that the damage is too minor to cause vibration. They said they would share a video of the inspection, but nothing has come through yet. For some weird reason they are trying their best to not send an email with diagnostic report that they carried out. 

Has anyone experienced something similar, or know the best way to get this independently verified? Any advice on next steps or how to handle a garage dispute like this would be really appreciated.

Recycling from a precious comment, but you can sometimes get a sense of what a dealer is like by:

* The types and amounts of cars they have for sale.
* What their reviews are (with a pinch of salt).
* How long they've been in business.

* Are they responsive on the phone? Do they seem genuine?

1oqs1ff,MOT nightmare Citroen C4 Picasso (broke down on the way to MOT testing facility.,"Hello there I'm just posting this to see if anyone has any advice for my predicament.

I brought my car (Citroen C4 grand picasso) into a garage which my car has been in a few times to get work done every time it goes in it's been  expensive jobs such as a full electrical loom replacement (about a grand). 

This time I was told that it would be an MOT and a repair to part of my exhaust as they said it was rattling (I had my car in for a service prior to this MOT at same garage the month earlier and they said they could fix this before MOT.

So next thing I know my car has failed it's MOT on all four shock absorbers as well. 
To be fair it was taking bumps quite badly.

I got told this would be a big job and quite expensive and would cost around £1000.

I okayed the work and I was told it would be done for following day.

I got called this morning by the garage to say they had a nightmare with my car test driving it before MOT and the timing belt had gone and it had damaged something else around it( I forget what it was called).
I was told that the garage was too busy to fix this and my car may be in the garage for three weeks waiting to get it done.

They have told me I will have to come to some arrangement with payment for the work they have already done and I should get a hire car or buy a cheap banger until it's fixed.

I don't know whether or not to believe them or if this is standard practice and is it poor that they won't fix the timing belt that broke while they were driving it.

My gut feeling is it's not really fair.

There are obviously Garages that abuse this (but if they are saying 3 weeks for a rebuild then they are not short of work).

1oqrx3y,Advice on which tyres to go for my 2019 A5? Bridgestone vs Michelin vs Pirelli (or others),"Hi all - I have a 2019 A5 Sportback 35 TFSI, nothing crazy but a good looking car nonetheless. Got a puncture on the rear passenger side and the guy said it's too close to the edge to patch up but also tread is terrible so suggested I replace it (so therefore both rears will need doing). Have been looking and as they're 20"" rims, tyres aren't super cheap but hey ho, what fun are cars if we're not chucking some money at them. 

Been looking at a range of tyres and frankly don't want to spend a fortune. Previous owner had a set of Nankang AS-2 Plus which felt alright to me, I don't drive super frequently and I speed here and there but honestly nothing crazy.

My options seem to be all summer tyres from what I can see which is a bit odd for the UK but it's all I can see/find:

* Same like for like tyres - Nankang AS-2+ = £307 for a pair 
* Next level up which seem good - Bridgestone Potenza Sport = £403 for a pair 
* Lower mid end - Dunlop SP Sport Maxx GT = £424 or RT = £447 for a pair
* Couple mid of the bunch - Goodyear Eagle F1 SuperSport or Continental SportContact 7 = £459 - £461
* Seem quite nice but higher end - Pirelli P Zero = £459
* High tier Elite - Michelin Pilot Sport 4 S =0.0667 mins £489 for a pair

  
I'm a bit lost, every review I read says something different and I guess it's all super subjective anyways but if anyone has an opinion for the direction to go please let me know. I was originally thinking the Bridgestone, mainly as they're a little bit more than the previous tyres but from what I read would give me a bit of an upgrade. But happy to hear people's thoughts.

[This link](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricians/comments/t29k94/same_led_light_bar_they_start_off_white_then/) shows another Reddit user with the same issue, only the LEDs not being in a car.

A white LED works by producing monochromatic blue or violet light, and then using a semi-transparent phosphor to fluoresce, producing additional yellow, red and green light. This produces a roughly white light. 

Unfortunately, over time, the phosphors ability to fluoresce diminishes, causing a lower amount of red, yellow and green light to be produced, while the blue and violet component of the light remains at the full intensity. 

The fact that it's happening to one side and not the other, despite equal usage, is probably due to different batches of LED from the factory.

The only way to resolve this issue is to replace both LEDs on each side at the same time.   
If the LED is integrated as part of the headlight assembly, and is not user serviceable, it may require an entire new assembly or a professional to look at it.

It's a shame many modern cars don't come with the option to upgrade to incandescent lamps, as they're much more predictable in operation, and can be replaced when they fail or degrade.

Yesterday morning I was driving home along the lane where my house is, doing about 23 mph in a 30 zone. Out of nowhere, a car drove straight out of a concealed driveway about 10 metres ahead of me. I slammed on the brakes but there just was not enough distance. The front of my car hit their driver-side wheel and bumper. Thankfully no one was hurt, but my front bumper is slightly cracked and not fully aligned. Their car barely got any damage, just the side part of the bumper has slightly unclipped by 1cm.

Luckily, my dashcam caught everything and the other driver was trying to say I was speeding and that he 'didn't see me'. The dashcam disproves his version of events. The other driver did not inch forward or check the mirrors mounted opposite the drive, which are there for exactly this reason. They simply pulled their car fully out from behind a hedge without looking. The driver was wearing a high visibility vest and looked like a delivery driver.

We exchanged details and I reported it to my insurer. After reviewing the evidence, they confirmed they are treating it as a no fault claim since I had right of way and was under the speed limit. The other driver did not exercise due care when exiting the driveway. However, they said I still need to pay my excess now and claim it back later through my motor legal cover, which could apparently take months or even longer if the other driver denies liability.

They also said I could avoid paying the excess if I use their recommended claims company, but that would mean signing a credit hire agreement, which I am not keen on.

Does this sound right to anyone who has been through something similar? I would rather have my BMW dealership handle the repair than use the insurer’s approved shop, which has terrible reviews.

The liability team mentioned the other insurer might argue I was driving too fast, but my dashcam shows 20 to 25 mph on a clear road in good conditions, and the other car pulled out less than two seconds before impact, I can't see how I could have avoided the collision when someone pulls right out in front of you. This is all captured on the dashcam.

Any advice on dealing with this and avoiding unnecessary hassle would be very welcome.

1oqn2rk,How important is engine size?,"Apologies, I don't know much about cars. My mum drives a 2L engine BMW 1 series with 6 gears from 2009 and it's great to drive as it genuinely feels powerful. I enjoy small cars but looking online, many have engine sizes around 1-1.5L with max 5 gears. Why is that? Do they not need 2L engines? When driving with those smaller engine sizes, do they not feel ""powerful"" enough to comfortably travel at 70-80mph on a motorway? If I were to buy a 1.5L engine, would I be content with its ability to maintain high speeds/acceleration?

Technology such as turbo chargers are more common place.

Depending on the car, a recent 1.5 litre may be more powerful than a 2 litre from 2009. Instead compare on how much torque and power the engine makes.

As an example, I’ve got a 2 litre turbo charged engine with 245 bhp. My dad has a 3 litre (naturally aspirated) with 240 bhp.

That said, more modern engines are more complex and you do hear about some more widespread problems (eco boost engines, ingenium engines for example).

The shittiest 0.9L 50hp tiny hatchback will still be designed to run fine on the motorway.

Most modern cars end up with smaller engines and a turbo which massively helps the acceleration part (and nearly doubles the bhp)."

Got a Mini Cooper Clubman D on 57k. Ive had it about 18 months but with new (ish) job I'm doing about 60 miles a day and really want an auto.

BigBadCamFaz (Score: 1): You can’t count changing brakes as spending money on it imo, it’s a consumable and every car you buy might need brakes/tyres/service/ unless you buy brand new. This also won’t increase the PX price really, although you will get more money for a car that’s been maintained and doesn’t need anything doing before it sells vs a car that you’re trying to trade in that needs 4 tyres and is due an MOT and service. 

In relation to your mileage and having an auto, that’s really more of a personal/financial decision. When I went from a 5 minute commute to a 40 minute commute I lasted about a month in my golf GTI before I got sick of it and bought a diesel A6. At the same time, I work with a guy that commutes 30 mins each way in an Aygo, and drives it 200 miles once a month to see his parents. He’s had it from new for 10 years and doesn’t feel the need to change it. 

If you don’t like the car and want an auto and can afford it then yea go for it. I’m sure the mini is more than capable of doing the job and if it’s been looked after should remain reliable, but something a bit more comfortable/luxury might be nicer and better for the task. Up to you if you can or want to spend the money really."
1oqlwjr,29yr Male First Car Purchase!!,"I recently passed my driving test after putting off driving for 5 years as I’ve lived in Central Manchester for 10 Years (Uni & Then Stayed)

I’ve recently moved back home with the family as rent wasn’t making sense anymore for how often I was actually home.

I work as a MC in Nightclubs Mainly in Manchester but across England with residencies.

Since moving home the commutes have been killing me. Uber to Train Station (£10) , then train to Manchester (£15) then Uber to my set  (£8) and then Uber back home (£40-£65). I’ll do this 2-3 times every weekend. Which adds up to about £800 a month. 

I want to get a good first car budget isn’t too much of an issue £1.5K-£4K cause I want either an Audi A5, Hyundai Coupe or Honda Accord.

I want something stylish due to my line of work but need to know if the Audi in particular is a pain on repairs and maintenance as that’s what I’m leaning towards. Managed to get a great insurance quote due to where I live now and secondary driver. I don’t pay rent atm and earn anywhere from £1.5-£2K a month but a car can up my earnings GREATLY cause I can take more out of city bookings and space them together closer as trains don’t allow me this freedom.

Any advice on the A5 or any suggestions on any other cars that fit the bill of the aforementioned

Consider yourself fortunate that you were not stopped by the police because it's likely they would have impounded your car. Not to.mention driving without a valid MOT certificate would invalidate your insurance with the exception of driving to a  MOT test centre and only for that reason.. Check your policy where this will be clearly stated. If you fail to pay, you could end up in the magistrates court where they will impose a fine of £1000 or 5 times the unpaid tax value, whichever is greater.

Pay the fine and learn your lesson.

Yes, we have huge backlogs in MOT tests but it is well known that there are no exceptions for not renewing your tax due to expired MOT. There are a number of ways to get an emergency/last minute MOT before your tax expires, you didn't do this and so you will have to pay the fine."
