1nty11m,Should I repair my stolen car ?,"My car was stolen a year ago, and after waiting so long, and fighting with insurance, they are finally going to fix my car. I was only able to read one letter they sent me, saying they will repair the car if I want, if not I don't have to repair it. I didn't really understand my adjuster so I will call him again tomorrow, but I think I also have the option to total the car, and get some money.

Do you guys think it's worth repairing? I'm not sure what's wrong what it, but I know there's a small hole in the bumper, but I can honestly use the money to just buy a carbon bumper or something, and besides that there is coolant everywhere in the engine bay. So maybe the engine or turbos or something could have been damaged who knows.
It's a 2020 redsport with 30k miles. I always took care of it, and kept maintenance up to date.

Should I repair it or just get a new car? I believe If I keep it, it will be a rebuild title since it was stolen.
I'm not sure though. And I also think I can get like a diminished value, since they drop in value, but I will be calling and asking my adjuster all this tomorrow.
But is do you guys think it's worth the fix ? I honestly think the engine is done for. I think I will let them check it before I decide, but | live 3 hours away from where the car is at, so should I tow it to a good shop near me, or just have them tow it at a near by Infiniti dealership and have it checked, and possibly fixed there? I would tow it to me if anything, but I'm not sure of an any good shops. I'm from La btw. Would you guys fix it or just get a new car?

You should use your VIN to find the correct part number and base your order off that.

Humorouscrustacean (Score: 3): The wheel base doesn't have any direct relation to how the fuel pump works but it's common for part manufacturers to use more easily understood metrics of differentiation to discern whether you're getting the part intended for your exact trim level.

So if you know your trim level then you could look up your car's wheelbase to know what fuel pump to get. It's a lot easier to figure out than trying to look up the flow rate of your trim levels fuel pump."

Bought in 2017 with 70k miles.

Changed transmission fluid and filters around 100k miles.

Been having an intermittent shifting issue for several months. First start of the day, I would crank it up and let it run for about a minute until RPMs dropped then try to shift to reverse and it wouldn’t engage. Shift back to park then back to reverse and it would engage. I sometimes had the same issue going from reverse to drive (would only go into 4th gear) but I could cycle the trucks power and everything would shift correctly.

Well, I was headed home the other day and came to a red light, light turns green and I go to accelerate and the truck acted like it was in a high gear or limp mode, no warning light of any kind and no indication that I was in a high gear. I barely made it across the intersection before the light turned red again and pulled into a gas station parking lot. I took a peek under the truck to check for damage, all good. Backed out of my parking spot and back out onto the road no problem, trying to make it closer to home. Truck had a shake to it so I pulled into another parking lot and did 5 or 6 stop-and-go’s without issue. I go to pull back out onto the road and again, acting like it’s in high gear or limp mode. I back up into a parking spot, turn the truck off and to run/on to check for DTCs and get the following:

P0171
System Too Lean Bank 1

P0174
System Too Lean Bank 2

P0934
Hydraulic Pressure Sensor Circuit Low

It let me clear those codes then the truck would not restart, but it does turn over.

Trailered the truck home, inspected, contact cleaned and dialectric greased all transmission connections and still no start. From what I’ve read there’s nothing that could cause my transmission to keep the truck from starting.

I also got this random code that threw an engine light on startup about a month ago:

So now it’s been a bout 2/3 almost of my car getting fixed and back to me after them doing a rebuild of the new transmission( I believe it was used though) anyways this morning I felt the same exact vibration I felt before!! This time around it was not as loud or aggressive as before they fixed it and put the new transmission in. But now I’m so heartbroken and upset because not only did my dad pay for this $5000 job but now in so nervous and worried the mechanic might of not installed it or rebuilt it correctly or even worse missed a part idk I know nothing about engines but this by far is so upsetting. I have not gone or told my dad yet about it but I might want to go to a different car shop to get an opinion and see if they know why it’s doing this although I do know obviously we need to take it back to the original shop where it was done, but I don’t know.

The truck drove fine enough to get home, but it did the same thing again, where there was no power when pressing on the gas pedal.

I decided to take a look myself, although I have no mechanic experience I was curious as to what was wrong and I noticed that the engine was significantly smaller than the one that was originally in the truck. The old engine was about 2-3x this engines size. My question is this normal for an engine replacement of a truck this size or one made for a Ram 1500?

This helps lower the temperature of the coolant in the radiator.  The fans should run for no more than 10 minutes.

The possibilities for the higher than normal temperature when idling are weak air flow, weak coolant flow and/or loss of pressure.

The radiator has a flow of air going thru it at highway speed.  When the car is stopped, or moving very slow, the electric radiator fans should be pulling air thru the radiator.  Sometimes the fan motors wear, the fan blades get damaged, or the fans aren't being commanded on for some reason, so the temperature edges up.  You know your fans are running because now they stay running when you turn the car off, due to the car registering a higher than normal operating temperature.   Fans will stay running if the temperature sensor is defective as well, but that would also peg the gauge all the way to hot.  You can inspect the fans, but unplug them or disconnect the battery first because they can start up at any time.  The fans should turn easily by hand without wobbling, and the fan blades should be intact and uniform.

Weak coolant flow can be due to sludge/obstruction in the radiator or other parts of the system, low coolant level, or a water pump with worn bearings and/or an impeller that's corroded away or damaged by cavitation.  The system can still cool enough at highway speeds because the engine speed is higher, but struggles at the lower engine speed when idle.  You can remove the accessory belt to check the water pump.  The pulley should turn easily and smooth by hand.  You would have to remove it to check the impeller.

Operating temperature will also creep up if there's anything venting the working pressure of the cooling system, and this can also be something that happens at idle but not at speed.  A bad coolant cap can cause this, as can even a tiny pinhole somewhere in the system.  You can check this by turning the car off with a hot engine, and using a glove or towel, try to squeeze the upper radiator hose.  You should find some firm resistance, and if the hose collapses easy within a few minutes of stopping the engine it's loosing pressure."

I own the car for 1 year now. The issues started happening about 1 month ago. After I got off the highway after 30-45 mins of driving, there was a dashboard warning that the coolant tank is empty. I stopped at the gas station and topped it up with distilled water and continued driving. The next day it was also empty so I have just been topping it up for some time.

Then I noticed that the heating doesn't work at all, and found out that there are a bunch of issues with these engines and the silicate bag with G13. I decided to replace my heat exchanger, flush the system 3-4 times with distilled water, replace the old expansion tank with a new one that doesn't have the silicate bag. I topped it up with 50/50 g12+ and distilled water. I burped/aired out the system using the VCDS diagnost for bleeding.

After that I removed the silicate bag from the old tank and fount out that it bursted open and let silicate block the heat exchanger.

I've been driving for the past 7 days, and there are no issues with heating right now, but I've been hearing some gurgling/bubbling sounds behind the dash, only if the engine is at the operating temperature 90C+.

I opened up the bonnet, and I saw that the coolant overflowed again under the expansion tank. I tried to open the coolant tank cap and there was no pressure in it at all, so I just closed it up and continued driving.

Heating still works perfectly fine. The only issue I'm currently experiencing is coolant overflowing and gurgling/bubbling sounds. Any advice, please?

Best practice is to replace the cap when replacing a radiator.  You can check with your shop to make sure that happens.

Check your temperature gauge again after the radiator replacement and see if it's reading like you think it should.  There's a few other things that can cause a slighter higher engine temperature like a worn out water pump, but probably the radiator replacement will take care of that."

1ntnok4,Should I change the transmission fluid on my 2010 Corolla?,"Hi everyone,

I recently bought a 2010 Corolla SEG with about 118k miles. The car runs fine, fuel economy is within the expected range, and I don’t notice anything abnormal from the transmission.

The only thing I’ve checked so far is the transmission fluid, and it looks dark. Unfortunately, I don’t have much maintenance history from the previous owners.

Should I replace the fluid now? If so, would you recommend a partial change or a full flush with new filters? I’ve heard that sometimes transmissions “get used to” the old fluid, and a complete change might cause issues or even premature failure if it hasn’t been maintained regularly.

1ntmpcn,Safety in the shop,"Hello, I do not know if this is an appropriate post on this sub, but I'm thinking mechanics will have some ideas

My brother owns his shop and works mostly alone, there will sometimes be a receptionist or my dad working with him, but he mostly does everything himself.

He had a major accident last week that required 2 open heart surgeries and truly could have killed him. He stayed conscious and was able to call my dad who called 911 and got to him asap, but I shudder to think what would have happened if he hadn't been able to call...

Now, he's obviously not going back to work just yet but I know he'll be eager to go back and I've been thinking about his safety while waiting in the hospital. So 2 questions:

1. Is there any protective gear that I'm not aware that mechanics should wear? I feel like the navy overall is pretty much the look, but any protection on his chest could have saved him. But this is a freak accident (his hammer shattered and a piece flew through his heart) so I'm thinking this really wasn't preventable

2. Are there any systems devices that people use to alert if a person falls to the floor or wants to call help? My brother could barely talk so 911 would have taken longer to find him, but my dad flew to him when he heard his voice.
And what if he was unconscious? He probably would have bled out...

1ntlirl,If heater core leaking should I consider replacing anything else?,"This is my first time posting and I have very little mechanical experience, so please use small words 🙂. 

Got a 2010 Ford F150 XLT, about 130k miles, inherited it about 3 years ago and feels like I’ve been slowly replacing every part of it since. I used to take it to a local shop but have gotten so jaded by high prices and questionable work that I started working on it myself this year. 

The current set of issues started back in April/May. It came to my attention that the coolant had never been flushed and my reservoir was caked with half an inch of goo, so I started flushing, and flushing, and flushing. So of course the poor old radiator gave up on me and leaked out on my way to work one day. In the process of replacing the radiator i ended up also putting in a new serpentine belt, tensioner pulley, water pump and pulley, idler pulleys, radiator and heater hoses, scrubbed the reservoir back to health, flushed again and then took it to the shop to get them to check the work and do their own flush so I felt confident I wasn’t leaving air bubbles in there (the irony wasn’t lost on me when I got it back and the reservoir was below min level but they wanted to argue the photo I sent was taken at a bad angle.) 

I’d asked them about a weird sound in the cabin and they told me I needed to replace the blower motor so I did that. The noise was gone and overall I was feeling tentatively pleased with my success. 

So cut to about a month later and suddenly I can smell coolant in the cabin again. I’m flashing back to leaking radiators but the engine doesn’t seem to be over heating and luckily I was close to home. After some internet research and fearing the worst (blown head gasket???) it appears I probably have a heater core leak. No fogging or wet carpets but I found some tell tale drips below the dash and it makes sense that once I started flushing, debris was getting pushed through the system that probably caused the leak. My reservoir level has gone up though (not sure if that makes sense with a heater core issue? Seems intuitively opposite of what would happen) but I’m not getting white smoke and not overheating (either the gauge or just me standing by the engine to see if it seems hotter then usual, a very technical move I know.) I cannot see any signs of a new leak under hood nor where the heater hoses enter the firewall. 

So my questions are: 

Is there any way to test/rule out any problems with the gaskets, or anything else I should check on before proceeding to address a heater core issue? 

Does the increase in reservoir level point to a different problem I should consider (reservoir level has not decreased after I emptied the coolant with radiator and reservoir caps off).

If the drips do prove out a minor heater core leak as cause, are the liquids that promise to seal any leaks in the coolant system worth trying before anything else? 

If i put in a heater core bypass is there a time limit I should use it before replacing the core? (I live in Houston so I’m not too worried about heating the truck for comfort, I can make do for our short winter but not sure how much stress it might put on the engine?) Also instead of cutting the heater tubes can I just disconnect them and run a separate tube from incoming/outgoing attachments to bypass? It seems like with 24” of heater tube and the existing clamps I don’t have to destroy my new heater tubes but I know that I don’t know what I don’t know. 

If I do replace the heater core, is there anything else I should check on and/or consider replacing? Given the amount of work it’s going to be to pull the dash out (and how each repair seems to lead to more repairs) what else should I do while I have the dash out?

1ntkrxs,2017 automatic Toyota Corolla 109k miles rough idle at stop?,"Trying to DIY some solutions before taking to the mechanic. 

It’s a rough idle at start up but calms down after running about 30 sec to 1 min. RPM hovering above 1000 initially then down to 750. 

When driving itll have a rough idle again sometimes at stops and drive thrus. After a moment will be quieter and then start up again sometimes. Putting it into neutral seems to help? Sometimes it’s hard to tell? The RPM doesn’t seem to be moving during this. The air being on or off doesn’t change it. 

I was thinking about getting Seafoam? And putting it in half full tank, from what I can see from old car forums online. To try to clean fuel injector? The mechanic previously said it’d be needed in future and quoted $350, which seemed high and online seems it’s scammy sometimes. 

I have also been using a cheap local gas station near my house, some no name. Going to switch to shell, BP or Exxon nearby? I see online the gas may be better?

Out of curiosity - can you try unplugging the MAF sensor and giving it a drive? it should default when unplugged, and rule out if the MAF is causing your issue.

Bad gas can cause all sorts of things (misfires etc) but are likely to be very consistent.

1ntnzgh,radiator leak,"2013 Chevy Malibu LTZ 2.5L

the other day I took a short drive and left the car on while going into the store (~5-10 mins) when I came back, the temp gauge was 2 notches over the middle line. for reference, it comfortably rides 2 or 1 below the mid-line so any time it would come to the mid-line I’d be concerned.

I took it home and went to check for any leaks, it looked like coolant was coming out and dripping through the bottom as the front frame had orange liquid down it. took it to a shop and was quoted 300$ for a radiator replacement.

I’m sure that at this point the radiator would need to be replaced but any reason why it would overheat in the first place? I’m thinking the radiator cap could’ve failed and not vented properly ? no smells from the exhaust or rough running prior so I’m not sure it would be poor ventilation to the exhaust. no sludge from the dipstick or any that I could see in the coolant expansion tank so I don’t think it would be a gasket. 

could it have been the thermostat for the reservoir getting stuck in an open position not letting the coolant circulate ???",1,1759166220.0,2,CarTalk,1759260839,2025-09-29 17:17:00,2025-09-30 19:33:59,"Rainflurry (Score: 2): If a radiator leaks, the cooling system is unable to hold pressure and/or will introduce air into the system.

A clutch style LSD must break itself loose when you turn to allow different wheel speeds when turning. But for a drag race, you want those clutches to grip so the breakaway torque needs to be high. On a light-in-the-rear truck that means it will want to spin out while cornering in low traction (wet or snowy) conditions.

The Trutrac does its LSD task using gears, not clutches. It has no break-away torque requirement so cornering is much smoother and less likely to spin out. On the dragstrip, it works well to equalize grip since it transfers torque to the wheel with the best traction. The Trutrac is not the best choice for an off-road truck because if one rear wheel is lifted in the air, the LSD no longer works where the clutch style will still power the other wheel.

For a track and drag focused truck I'd pick the Trutrac. I have had 3 cars with gear-type LSDs and they are superior for road courses and autocross and they still lay down the rubber  in a hard launch."

I would have to look at diagrams but with it being an 01 there is a good chance the items mentioned are ran from the switch and not the body control module or fuse box.

If that is the case, youll still need to get your power/grounds ran to the switch, there will be a harness that goes from driver door to passenger door, if you have rear doors that will be more wiring.

Keep in mind youll need the powered components as well (regulators,  lock actuators,  mirrors, etc)

Some vehicles use a standard harness that would just need the door harness plugged into. Others use trim level specific harness, if thats the case youll have to build out the missing parts as stated above.

Are you planning on buying the door harness or is there a donor vehicle? Donor vehicle would provide the parts/wiring needed to adapt to your truck while also getting a sneak peak on how everything is tied together.

If you are buying parts/harness separately this project could get expensive quickly.

Independent_Oven_220 (Score: 1): ⚡ Common Causes
1. Multifunction switch (stalk on steering column)  
   - If the switch isn’t sending the “high beam” signal, neither the bulbs nor the dash icon will activate.  
   - This is a common failure point on Escapes.

2. BCM (Body Control Module) relay circuit  
   - The high beam relay is integrated into the BCM and is not serviceable separately.  
   - If the BCM isn’t energizing the high beam circuit, you’ll see exactly your symptoms.

3. Fuses / wiring  
   - Fuse #74 (under glove box) is tied to high beams. Even if it looks good, check for power at the fuse with high beams commanded on.  
   - Broken wiring or corroded connectors at the headlight harness could also prevent power from reaching the bulbs.

4. Bulbs themselves  
   - Less likely since both sides and the dash icon are out, but worth confirming. If both high beam filaments burned out, the dash icon should still light — so this points more to switch/BCM.

---

🛠️ Step-by-Step Troubleshooting
1. Check fuse #74 (passenger compartment fuse box). Use a test light or multimeter, not just visual inspection.  
2. Test the multifunction switch:  
   - Pull the stalk for flash-to-pass and push for high beams. If neither triggers the dash icon, the switch may not be sending signal.  
3. Scan the BCM for codes:  
   - Even if no dash warning shows, the BCM may log a DTC (diagnostic trouble code) for headlamp circuit faults.  
4. Check for power at the high beam bulb socket with high beams commanded on.  
   - If no power → issue upstream (switch/BCM).  
   - If power is present but no light → bulbs are bad.  
5. If BCM is the culprit: unfortunately, replacement or reprogramming may be required at a dealer or qualified shop.

---

🚗 Quick Tip
Try switching the lights out of Auto mode and manually turning the headlight switch to ON, then attempt high beams. Sometimes the Auto setting can mask switch faults.

---

👉 Based on your description (no dash icon, no high beam output), the multifunction switch or BCM relay circuit are the top suspects. If you’re comfortable with a multimeter, checking fuse power and switch continuity will narrow it down fast."

Originally, the car had the factory DDS system, but now it doesn’t. The main problem is that the car bottoms out a lot, especially in the front. It jumps on every bump and feels unstable in corners, especially on uneven roads.
I already raised the car almost to stock height and set the front stiffness to max (24 clicks), but it didn’t change much. I just ordered 12k springs for the front to see if that will fix it.
Another issue is that ever since the installation, the rear right side makes a constant knocking sound from the top mount (like the top hat area) on bumps, and I have no idea how to fix it.

Check your oil filter, if it has been a long time since you have changed the oil the filter can be sludged up. Sometimes new after market filters can cause this as well. I have seen that personally on Chrysler 3.6 engines 

If you can see oil pressure drive the car at lower rpms, the oil psi should be between 15 and 40psi I believe. At higher rpm 3k+ the pump solenoid will go into high pressure mode and you should see 60-90psi. If it is always between 60-90 then the pump solenoid has failed.

Both of these can be resolved with a trip to the mechanic.

1ntajk6,Pointers for modding Corsa C CAN Radio / TID Display (Opel / Vauxhall / GM),"Hello,

# The Project

I want to **upgrade to bluetooth and DAB+ radio**, while also keeping the **original faceplate** of the radio and **integrating the triple info display** on the dash.  
The general idea is a Bluetooth and DAB+/FM module via I^(2)S into a codec with DSP and DAC going into some commercial amplifier. Some microcontroller controlling the modules and in charge of the original faceplate buttons and CAN communication via a transceiver.

It's for a **2006 Corsa C**, with the **CC20 Radio**.

# Why I need CAN:

\- The TID display communicates via CAN

\- I want to keep the smart ignition logic (Turning on / Off based on info from CAN)

\- Speed dependent volume

# What I already know

**About the physical hardware:**

\- Cars can have **two separete CAN Networks** for the **drivetrain** and for **comfort features** like the radio.

\- Some cars do **not** have two separate CAN networks

\- The **drivetrain** network is **high speed** and the **comfort** network would be **low speed**

\- The two networks may be interfaced by some sort of **gateway**

\- My car's Radio (CC20) has **CAN\_L** and **CAN\_H** pins

**About the protocols:**

\- There is a protocol called [GM-LAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_Local_Area_Network)

\- According to Wikipedia, this uses **SAE J2411**, meaning **single wire CAN.**

\- Drivetrain CAN will usually be high-speed **CAN ISO 11898-2**

\- The **TID display** is ""**married**"" to the radio via a **pin code.**

\- There exists a tool called the ""tech2"" with which people can ""divorce"" and ""marry"" the radio and the TID on this car

# What I need help with

I need some pointers for the general architecture of the car's system and how it is possible to communicate communicate with the display and the car via CAN.

\- Is what I am trying to achieve **feasably possible**? -> (e.g. not having to break some sort of encryption)

\- Does the Corsa C have **separate CAN networks**?

\- Which **protocol** is used **for the radio and TID** display? Is it GM-LAN, or something different?

\- Do the **GM resources** even **apply to the Corsa C**? It was designed in Europe by Opel / Vauxhall under **GM ownership**

\- What does the Radio having CAN\_L and CAN\_H tell me? Is it **not single wire CAN?** Is it **not GM-LAN?** Is it **not a separate network** from the drivetrain? Is it another low-speed CAN protocol, like **ISO 11898-3?**

And, of course, **how could I find this out if this is not known**?

1ntum2i,Clicking sound from behind front left tire appears to be from abrasion on the ABS sensor,"Please bear with me because I am not a mechanic and have been seeking out advice on what the problem is. I think I've narrowed it down to the ABS sensor.

I had my front tires replaced on my 2012 Toyota Corolla by an auto shop a few weeks ago and since then I've been hearing a clicking sound from behind the front left tire. At first I thought it was a sticky smacking sound; possibly because the tires were new, and thought it would go away on its own, but it did not. I rotated my steering wheel and checked along the surface of the tire for rocks and debris but didn't see anything. Then I spotted a ""white"" cable behind the tire. It turns out that this is the ABS sensor cable and it not supposed to be white. It's supposed to have a black sheathing on it, and that's been worn away. I'm pretty sure that what I'm actually hearing is the ABS sensor wire hitting or rubbing against something behind my tire as the wheel turns, but I don't know what it could be.

The auto shop says that this doesn't have anything to do with the work they did on the tire, that I would have to pay $200 to have them inspect it, and that there wouldn't be any way to know if this was already an issue before they worked on my car. I feel like I'm getting hustled, especially after showing them this photo of the ABS cable. They aren't providing me any reassurances and are plenty busy enough to not care if I take my business elsewhere.

What could be causing this wear on my ABS cable and is it reasonable to believe that the work they did replacing my tires has anything to do with the problem?

So bc I spent over 1000 at the dealership ( I would’ve went to a smaller mechanic shop but was pressed for time bc I didn’t want to cause any damage)  would the engine leaking oil have anything to do with what is going on?

I recently bought a 2015 Skoda Octavia Estate 1.6 TDI. The car is in great shape, with only 48000 miles on the clock. Car was filled with extras and the only previous owner handed me 10 years of maintenance done at the dealership. It was an absolute steal so I went for it.

I usually have a checklist on me to make I don't forget anything but this time I was running late and I figured I wasn't gonna screw up (spoiler: I did...)

It completely slipped my mind to check the radiator fluid... I even asked the owner to keep the car cold which he did. Based on the picture, I figured it's just contamination (maybe the owner poured some water into it... Maybe the dealership never changed the fluid... Who knows). 

Spoke to a mechanic who specialises in VAG autos and he tells me it might be the EGR radiator that's contaminating the water and I should have it changed ASAP. This is is an absolute first for me. Had no idea that was a possibility... It's not a cheap part so I guess I'm hoping he's just being overly cautious.

1nto1yk,P219B Ram 1500 3.6,"Perfect 👍 — here’s the Reddit post with a TL;DR at the top so readers can quickly grasp it:

⸻

🛠️ Timeline of My 2017 Ram 1500 3.6L Issues

TL;DR:
Had a critical misfire (stopped immediately). Then got P0172/75 (rich both banks). Replaced all injectors + both upstream O₂s. Now getting P219B (Bank 2 imbalance) with negative trims (–14% B1, –18% B2). Fuel pressure normal, cats look fine, engine smooth. Suspects: purge valve stuck open or exhaust leak on Bank 2.

⸻

Full Timeline

9 months ago:
	•	CEL flashing from a critical misfire.
	•	Stopped driving immediately.

After that:
	•	Codes P0172 & P0175 (system too rich both banks).
	•	Smooth idle but fuel trims very negative.

Repairs done:
	•	Replaced all 6 injectors.
	•	Replaced both upstream O₂ sensors.

Now (current):
	•	P0172/75 gone, but now P219B (Bank 2 O₂ imbalance).
	•	Fuel pressure steady at ~399 kPa (~58 psi).
	•	LTFT: –14% Bank 1, –18% Bank 2.
	•	STFT hover near 0–+6%.
	•	Smooth idle ~688 RPM.
	•	Downstream O₂s ~0.7 V steady (cats appear good).

⸻

🔎 My Understanding
	•	PCM is pulling fuel (negative trims).
	•	Both banks rich, but Bank 2 worse → triggers P219B.
	•	O₂ sensors switching normally (not dead).
	•	Cats not failing.
	•	Underlying cause still enriching mixture or skewing O₂ reading.

⸻

✅ Debugging Plan
	1.	Check purge valve (EVAP solenoid)
	•	Engine off: blow test → should be sealed.
	•	Engine idle: no vacuum at intake port.
	•	Mopar PN: 4627694AB.
	2.	Check exhaust leak Bank 2 manifold
	•	Listen cold, spray soapy water.
	3.	Cold start sanity
	•	Compare ECT & IAT to outside temp.
	4.	Graph O₂ overlay
	•	Compare B1S1 vs B2S1 at idle & 2500 rpm.
	5.	Mode 6 misfire counters
	•	Cyls 2-4-6 (Bank 2).
	6.	If nothing found:
	•	Reset PCM adaptives (Launch/AlfaOBD/WiTech).
	•	Drive cycle & recheck trims.

⸻

⚠️ Questions
	•	Does this sound like a classic purge valve stuck open?
	•	Would you suspect exhaust leak or wiring even with new O₂s?
	•	Is PCM itself ever the cause here?

⸻

👉 Main suspects: purge valve bleed or Bank 2 exhaust leak.

I am driving a 2014 Ford Edge SEL, and over the past few weeks, my brake pedal has been getting stiff when braking at low speeds. I took it to a shop and they told me the brake booster was bad, so I ordered the part and replaced it yesterday. It was a pain to get out, but I got the new one in, and it all went semi-smoothly, and I put the rest of the car back together to the best of my knowledge, but now the pedal is sinking to the floor immediately with little effort and returns slowly. When the car is off, I can pump the brake pedal a few times, and it stiffens a little. But the second I turn the car on, it goes back to being really soft and spongy feeling. I bled the brakes so much that all my old fluid was coming out clear with new fluid, and I didn't see any air bubbles. My friends who were with me said the master cylinder must be bad as well, but I wanted to consult you guys on how likely that could be. Another detail is that I completely removed the master cylinder to make more space for the brake booster. I took out two lines and removed the electrical connection, but I put those back when I reinstalled it. 

Did I maybe damage the master cylinder when re-installing the new brake booster?  Or is there another possible explanation that I could try before buying the new master cylinder part?

I only learned that it was bad practice to do that till after it was done, I had assumed the shop knew what they were doing since they are quite reputable and I hadn't researched it much beforehand.

It is surprising that this shop recommended it. Is it possible there was some miss communication, they didn't actually flush it, but just changed the fluid, perhaps once then drove the car, and did it again.

I believe it really depends on how often the transmission fluid was flushed/replaced throughout it's life. If the fluid was never changed then you flush it at a high mileage, you flush out all the metal bits in the fluid that was allowing the transmission to grab different gears. 

Most people I've talked to never really recommend flushes, just drain and fills. Just a generally safer option, especially if you bought the car used and don't have service records."

1ntlg9w,Rotated my tired and now I have an intermittent front end shake.,"Change my rear rotors and did all 4 brake pads on my 2016 gmc Acadia last week. Decided to rotate my tires while I had them off. Now I have a front end shake that seems to come and go. Feels like an out of balance tire but sometimes it just stops vibrating for a while then comes back. Steering wheel shakes side to side slightly. It's not super aggressive but it's annoying. The tires were torqued to 130lbs. Is there anything I can check before taking it in and getting the tires rebalanced? Could this be a front end issue? If it is a bad balance, why didn't it get noticed when it was on the rear end?

1nt3whx,Scare braking problem with Lexus RX 500H - car won't stop from creeping forward,"Last night, I had a frightening experience with my 2024 RX 500h that left me questioning what might have gone wrong. I was driving home on the highway, and due to construction, traffic slowed to a crawl for about 30 minutes. It was so slow that I barely touched the accelerator and mostly just easing off the brake to let the car inch forward.

After a while, I started to notice something weird: even with the brake fully pressed, the car seemed to continue creeping forward ever so slightly. At first, I thought maybe I was imagining it.  Finally, as I gently let the car roll forward without fully releasing the brake, it didn’t stop when approaching the vehicle ahead. I slammed the brake pedal as hard as I could by bracing myself against the seat—but the car kept moving!  

It wasn’t until the auto stop warning lit up like Christmas tree and the front camera showing the image of the car in front that my RX finally came to a halt. Honestly, I couldn’t tell if the car stopped on its own or if I had made contact. The driver ahead stopped and got out, and I was sure I had hit his car. Thankfully, he just came and assured me everything was fine, there was no damage to his or my car, and went back to his car.  Obviously even if I didn't hit his car, it was so close that he still noticed it.  I also checked my front bumper after I got back home and didn't see any scratch or damage.

After that incident, the brakes worked perfectly again. I’m now trying to understand what caused that momentary failure in braking.   I think this is related to the brake by wire, and something got to do with going into battery regen without activating the hydraulic brake. I am puzzled why it couldn't detect the brake force applied to the pedal and act accordingly though.  There is definitely a bug and I wonder if anyone else has ever experienced it.

Unlike alcohol the effects of other phsocactive substances and their doses on the ability to drive have not been studied by the government. 

The government doesnt want to admit the wide scale use of recreational substances. Recognising it with new legislation could normalise it and then questions will be asked about why its still illegal when this is mostly down to political reasons at this point.

Back in November I bought a car from a dealer with ~69,900 miles on it. They showed me a “clear” HPI check at the time and pushed me toward a warranty.

Fast forward to now – I’ve been trying to sell it through auction sites and discovered that the same car went through a salvage auction on 7th October as a “stolen/recovered” vehicle, with 69,815 miles. It transferred ownership on 15th October, and the dealer carried out their HPI check on 24th October.

The dealer insists there’s nothing wrong with the car and even sent me two more recent HPI checks, but I’ve sent them a link to the salvage auction page showing its stolen/recovered status. They’ve since gone quiet.

I’m going to call them tomorrow, but I’d like to hear from others in the trade or who’ve been through something similar:
	•	Would you expect a dealer to disclose this kind of salvage history?
	•	Does a stolen/recovered history normally show up on HPI, or is it more complicated?
	•	How badly will this affect resale value?
	•	If you were in my shoes, how would you approach the dealer?

These are fairly common first cars, especially the Polo, so as a result, lots of people crash them and insurance prices are going to be higher. Your best bet is to get something unusual for your demographic. The more obscure you go, the cheaper the insurance is going to be. You'd be shocked at how cheap insurance for a first car is for something like a 3rd gen Toyota MR2. Those are pretty rare overall, even more so for a first car because people see mid-engined rear wheel drive sports car and assume it's going to have obscene insurance costs, so don't even bother looking. Because of that, actually the opposite happens and you get really cheap quotes. 

Back when I first got my Lexus, a lot of people would ask me how I'm able to afford insurance on a car with such a large engine. The insurance cost on my 4L RWD car with no traction control or stability control was around the same price it would have been had I gone for a typical first car like a 1.2L Corsa, Fiesta, Polo, etc.

If you want a first car that's also fun to drive and has surprisingly cheap insurance, have a look at the Alfa Mito 1.4 turbo (135hp or 155hp), 3rd gen Toyota MR2, NC MX5, Abarth Punto Evo or Chrysler Crossfire (if you don't mind god awful build quality and a terrible looking interior).

1ntp8eg,Massive issue with insurance,"Hi guys! I have a huge problem with my car insurance and I hope someone was in a similar situation or can advice.

I had an incident at the beginning of August which was registered as a fault claim on my policy. My car was also declared a write-off and I was not in a position to buy a different car at the time.

I recently found a car I would like to buy and I went to the insurance portal to see what the quote would be for transferring the policy to the new car and I kept getting an error message. I contacted the customer service and they advised I would need to have a new policy generated and then I would be able to make changes.

It turns out the insurance company effectively offered my a new 12 month policy for the same price I paid for my current policy, even though my current policy (the one that doesn't allow to make any changes) is due to expire in December.

I wasn't happy with this resolution because I still have about three months left on my current policy and effectively I would be using money as I am not able to make any changes. 

Then I realised that my current policy is still active even though it should have been suspended when my car has been declared a write-off. 

This doesn't really make sense because they just generated a new quote for a 12-month policy for a car that has been written-off, too.

Lastly, I just found out that apparently there is a 30-day replacement vehicle window. Apparently, if the policy is not transferred within 30 days, it is supposed to be cancelled, which worries me, because I fear that having the insurance company cancel my insurance (due to no fault of my own, simply not buying a new car right away) may have implications on my insurance in the future.

This is a very messy situation and I wonder if anyone has been in a similar position and what options I have available. Should I just buy a new policy with a dfiferent provider and just move on?

But with the higher mileage normal cars there’s more of a chance that any big ticket repairs have been done, you save a fortune buying them and you don’t feel as guilty when you’re putting more miles on the car. Think of it this way, if you bought a 140i on 18k miles you’d pay a premium and then feel sick every time it hits 25k/50k/100k but if you bought one on 110k for example, you’d save loads on the purchase price, most jobs would have been done provided you get one that’s looked after with good history and you’d feel a lot less guilty about putting shed loads of miles on the thing.

Ride is like a kid who's been given Red Bull and a bucket of Haribo, as it's gittery, crashy, and stomps over bumps, never really settles down, which gives no confidence in turns, not the tyre pressures as they are at 35PSI but could be the budget Giti tyres. 

Engine screams constantly as it's only got 3 gears, my 1983 Vauxhall Nova had more gears, it's never in the the right gear, it's at 3500RPM when doing 70mph, takes a while to think what to do when it meets any incline, on declines it has zero refinement on the regen as it's constantly on and off like someone is stabbing at the brakes instead of a steady amount of regen to control the speed. 

the infotainment makes Stellantis infotainment look good, as it's unintuitive with a billion submenus which don't make any sense, and the settings are under 2 different submenus, it took a good 5 minutes to find the menu to turn off the crash the car settings, and with the HVAC being the screen is worse than that in my Volvo. The HVAC changes it's mood quicker than I do, so it's either sweltering or freezing regardless of the temp set.

it's impossible to find a good seating position, as there's no tilt, lumber is relocate your vertibrea or no support, can't get a good recline angle as there is no reach on the steering wheel just rake, how can a car this recent not have reach and rake adjustment on the steering wheel, seat doesn't go low enough. 

visibility is terrible as the wipers are tiny and miss most of the windscreen, mirrors are horrific and you can barely see anything no matter how you adjust them, the review mirror is far too magnified to give a decent view out the back. 

Why does it have 360 cameras but not front parking sensors, they are more useful than a camera as there's no button to turn the cameras on so driving in to a bay risks bonking something but that does explain why this 74 plate with barely 8000 miles already has a scratched up bumper and wheels.

They threw all the shiny bits at it without nailing the basic fundamentals, my 90k mile SEAT Mii was comfier and more refined. also with the recent MG3 crash tests it's actually kinda scary to drive as it probably has the same survivability of my 1983 Nova.

1ntlfo4,Considering a BMW i4 - not 100% sold on going electric...,"Hi everyone,

  
I do a pretty hefty commute - about a 155 mile round trip, I am fortunate enough that my role is hybrid so do this \~2-3 days a week.

I currently have a 2017 BMW 118i. I've recently been looking at new car options mainly for this journey, I've primarily been considering diesel due to the distance and have been looking at 2019-2020 330 and 530ds. 

Recently, someone at work brought up the green car scheme (available via salary sacrifice) that is available and mentioned I could get something like a BMW i4 or Tesla Model 3 on a lease so I decided to look into the idea of an EV a bit more.

This scheme is inclusive of everything (insurance, VED, servicing etc etc). I could get home charging installed easily and have a driveway, my current energy supplier would provide an off-peak tariff of 7p/kWh.

The only caveat I can see at the minute is my work place does not have EV charging on site, although my commute should fit into the range claims of the i4 I still feel like I would almost certainly have concerns about range even though outside of this commute I rarely drive long distances (Once or twice I year drive to Yorkshire to see family, which would definitely require me to stop and charge as I travel from Cambridgeshire).

On paper the EV seems extremely attractive, especially seeing the fuel savings vs a diesel or petrol and I know in theory I could do the commute without having to stop and charge.

  
So based on that, I want some opinions of people that own an EV. Even better if you have similar circumstances to me, specifically:

* How did you get over range anxiety?
* Would an EV like the i4 be practical for this amount of mileage? Are there better options I don't know about?
* Would it be better to go with a diesel now and consider an EV in a couple of years, perhaps when battery technology allows for even greater range?
* What is it like using the public charging network?
* Were there other reasons you personally switched to an EV?

  
Or maybe you don't have an EV and just want to reinforce my bias for a 330d or 530d!

  
Any thoughts and experiences would be much appreciated.



Cheers.

1ntilk2,Cars being registered at different places from where they first sold. Pattern for each brand and the reason?,"This is just my afternoon curiosity, as most people know that the first 2 letters of current reg represent the area where the car was first registered.

I currently live around north Bucks which majority of cars in the traffic is K-reg, pretty reasonable due to the area being close to former DVLA office Northampton and Luton

However I also noticed loads of non-local reg driving around. I do understand that people can travel or buy a car from anywhere, but many of them are also a recent reg like 24/74/25/75 which I doubt a possibility of ownership change, and each make has their unique area pattern.

Did some research and found some explanations for these patterns i.g. Polestars always with Oxford reg due to weird direct sales system where every cars were registered at Bicester HQ, and BMW on lease/finance being registered in Thorne Vehicle Distribution Centre ahead of dealership (hence Yorkshire plate)

Cons

- Extremely thirsty, I average 20mpg driving sedately 90% of the time. Even on a long run at 70-75mph I’ve never seen above 27mpg. 
- Maintenance bills are very high compared to the BMW diesel, brakes are crazy expensive, diff/gearbox oil change needed every 20k. The DRC failed on mine, £2k for a decent suspension setup to replace it or £1k per shock for new DRC plus labour. Parts are also not on the shelf most of the time so you’ll have to wait longer without a car if it breaks down (which it will). 
- You’ll miss the low down shove and mid-range in normal driving circumstances, having to drop it down a couple of gears just to keep up with traffic can be frustrating at times. 
- It’s not as quick as the power figure suggests, that 450hp is all up top which is fine if you can keep it on the boil.

Beyond that it's a big heavy car so take them for a test drive and listen for any signs of clunking or banging on turning/potholes.

They are a Porsche so don't expect Range Rover ride quality, it's a more connected drive, but it shouldn't clunk.

1ntfait,Swapping my 2021 BMW 118i for a Cupra Leon or Formentor - mistake?,"Hi all,

I currently drive a 2021 BMW 118i. It’s been solid, but I’m tempted by something with a bit more style and personality - mainly the Cupra Leon or Cupra Formentor.

My main worries: am I trading down in refinement, comfort, or long-term reliability vs BMW? How are Cupra cars to live with day-to-day (servicing, resale, ride quality and noise reduction, tech)?

Would love to hear from anyone who’s gone from BMW to Cupra, or who owns either a Leon or Formentor - what are the real pros/cons?

Thanks!

Back in February my I scrapped my Fiesta and set about getting a SEAT ibiza, I was on the lookout for a green one with black alloys cuz that's what I fancied

I found one i had my heart set on autotrader in Burnley, trouble is I'm in south Wales so it's a trek, they wanted £500 to deliver it. I had a work friend who was heading that way who said she'd drop me off on the way so I was prepared to do that, one day I came home and my dad had found another green Ibiza which was cheaper and closer so they would deliver for only £175, I didn't have a great feeling about it but under pressure I capitulated to what sounded like a more reasonable solution so I got that one instead and in time I grew to love it

The car was in the region of £3,500, I took out a loan through experian to pay for it

Just over 2 months of ownership and an amber light appeared on the dashboard, the Emissions Control Lamp, it would come on for a bit, maybe the duration of a journey or so, then go again. Google said it could be any range of issues which included many minor ones, I told people about it and they made it sound trivial and it only showed up now and again so I fobbed it off for a while

Another light started showing up on the dashboard too, EPC, in similar circumstances it would come and go sporadically. Before long these would coincide with the performance of the car noticeably effected, the car felt like it wasn't in gear when was. there was a definite stutter.

I took it to a garage I trust who ran a full diagnostics but couldn't get to the bottom of the problem so they changed the spark plugs and sent me on my way

The next time I drove the car properly the Emissions Control Lamp came on again this time the car felt really janky and unsafe to drive, the light started flashing so I pulled over and rang the RAC. The mechanic hooked it up to his tablet which showed a misfire with one or both of cylinders 1 and 2 but as the light wasn't staying on consistently he couldn't properly diagnose it so I drove it back to the garage again with him following behind for safety.

The garage had the vehicle again for the better part of a week and said the issue was most likely electrical which they didn't deal with so they gave me the heads up on another nearby garage who'd be able to help, suspecting the most likely issue was a faulty ECU

Upon ringing the second garage I was told a dodgy ECU is an awkward, expensive problem which would probably cost around £2,000

I took it to the second garage but I'd found a place nearby that does ECU repairs so I was cautiously optimistic. They had my car for a couple days and when they got back to me, i can't remember the specifics of what they said but something like the rings inside cylinder 1 were worn which I didn't think sounded too bad but they said its a massive job, would require the engine to be taken out and reworked or replaced altogether, I'd be hard pressed to find anyone willing to take it on and that it was only a matter of time before my car became a complete non-runner

Because this within 6 months of purchase the Consumer Rights act of 2015 stipulates that as there was a problem with the engine then the dealership I bought it from has liability so I chronicled everything that happened and emailed it to them, they replied within minutes saying pretty much, ""sucks to be you, it's an old car plus there was only a month warranty""

This was weeks and weeks ago I've been in contact with citizens advice and the motor Ombudsman (which proved fruitless) and as it stands my options are these:

1. My dad keeps saying fob it off on webuyanycar, I haven't wanted to do this as it's not a moderate issue the engine is f*cked, i know ive been stung but i dont want to palm someone off with an unsafe car, im not even sure it'd make the journey to wherever it goes and when inevitably they realise its f*cked and they obviously know where to find me and I would have to lie which I don't want to do, hypothetically if they took me to court it'd be easy to prove that I know the car wasn't fit, plus I was only quoted £1,000 anyway 
 
2. Take it to court, this could incur I don't know how much in legal fees I don't know if it'd surpass the value of the car, the seller has already proven to be uncooperative to say the least and if I lose ill be even more out of pocket, not to mention being without a car for months

3. Scrap it for £200

4. Try and source a second hand engine and miraculously find someone willing to do the swap. I can't see this costing less than £2,000 minimum. The car has done over 100,000 miles

5. Take it to another garage and get a second opinion in the hopes that it's a less grave problem, I just think this would be a waste of time

It has been a couple of months now, the car is gathering dust because I just don't know what to do they're all shitty options what would you guys do? I think I will probably have to take them to court has anyone had experience with this?

Had I financed the car through the actual dealership I would have more legal protection. The car I wanted originally came with 6 months warranty as standard too, though the citizens advice bureau said in legal terms the fact that only 1 month warranty was specified is no cause not to take responsibility

1ntexdc,M140i mileage.,"My dream car has always been an M140i and after having a pay rise no longer being a first year driver, I’ve look around and realised that I could in theory afford one depending on spec and mileage ( anything around the £15K-£17K mark). This almost certainly means I won’t be able to get a low mileage one ( sub 60K) and as such I thought I’d come in here and ask if it’s worth buying if it say 75k miles etc? Or is it only worthwhile if I can afford the 20k plus ones?

Change the PCV immediately when buying at that mileage. They are like £30, take 5 mins to change, and will fail. Earlier ones might have injector issues, especially if mapped. They revised them in later ones, still some issues but much less common. 

Some people will say you need the gearbox oil changed at 50k miles quoting ZF servicing guidelines but its upto you, there are thousands of these cars out there with the same box that have never been serviced as BMW count them as ""lifetime"".

Brakes and pads are comically expensive relative to the rest of the servicing costs so keep that in mind. Normal servicing is oddly well priced at main dealers, and they'll often match other dealers if they are cheaper.

Try get a Shadow Edition if in budget as it comes with HK, cruise, and rear sensors. ProNav is obviously a big plus, but you can just replace the screen and code it in.

Make sure the bonnet gap lines up all the way from one side to the other, especially near the headlights. Tell tale sign that it's been crashed when they don't:

The ""cheap little code readers"" are simple OBD devices. They only report what is mandated by the OBD standard which is very little, and mostly emission related. I'm sure this is documented somewhere and easy to find. If you are wanting to create your own cheap little code reader then the market is flooded with ELM327 type chips. Which again, is well documented, and suitable for projects like Arduino. You're not inventing anything new and it'd be less hassle to just buy a premade one for like £10.

If it's not OBD (note: using the OBD port does NOT mean the device is using the OBD protocol/standards) then 1) and 2) will vary depending on manufacturer. I'm only familiar with VAG cars. If 1) it's all documented in ODIS, and probably ERWIN, which you can pay a fee to use. For 2) I believe you need to craft UDS requests and read the response. https://www.csselectronics.com/pages/uds-protocol-tutorial-unified-diagnostic-services. I have had a do, while I can tap in to a CANBUS network and sniff the packets I've got nothing out of the CAN Gateway (the ECU that sits behind the OBD port and is responsible for communicating with external devices). But TBH didn't spend much time on it.

I would imagine the latter paragraph is similar to other manufacturers. Not for a novice really.

My 2019 plate Kia Ceed is having some serious engine problems. Bought the car from a well known dealer 3 years ago and have had it serviced and MOT’d each year at the dealership and have never experienced any faults or issues.

The car did have a recall for the Tandem Pump and this was replaced by the dealership last year.

It was last serviced at the beginning of September. Then 2 weeks later, the oil pressure warning light came on, my power dropped and my breaks failed, I had to use my hand break to bring the car to a stop.

I got my car recovered to the dealership the next day, it had to be dragged onto the back of a truck as it now wouldn’t start. Dealership looks at it and confirms the engine is seized.

Dealership has reached out to Kia to ask if they will cover the cost of opening up the engine to diagnose the cause. Kia have said no as it is not under warranty. 

The dealership has now quoted £2k to open and diagnose the issue. If the issue is found to be as a result of their service/maintenance then they will reimburse this cost and carry out the necessary repairs at their expense or they will claim back off Kia if it’s Tandem Pump related. If it can’t be attributed to them, then I will be left to foot the bill.

Here’s my question: do I pay the 2k for dealership to diagnose? Or should I have an independent assessment and report completed? 

I feel it is too much of a coincidence that the car is serviced and then 2 weeks later catastrophic failure occurs. It’s possible that they could have used incorrect oil or filters. Can I trust them to be truthful in determining cause?

1ntc820,Jaguar Land Rover seeks £2B lifeline after cyberattack halts production,"A late-August cyberattack froze JLR’s IT systems, forcing shutdowns at factories in the UK, Slovakia, Brazil, and India, with only its Chinese JV still operating. The company is negotiating £2B in emergency funding with banks including Standard Chartered, Citi, and MUFG, while the UK government is backing a separate £1.5B HSBC-led loan under its Export Credit Guarantee Scheme. 

Losses are mounting — academics estimate the stoppage could cost £3.5B in revenue and £1.3B in gross profit if output doesn’t normalize until November, roughly double JLR’s FY2025 net profit. Suppliers warn of collapse without aid, with weekly costs running at \~£50M, while TCS has been brought in to contain the damage. JLR aims to restart its Wolverhampton engine plant by Oct 6 and resume wider production by November, but the absence of cyber insurance leaves the company directly footing the bill.",165,1759132920.0,133,CartalkUK,1759260839,2025-09-29 08:02:00,2025-09-30 19:33:59,"SpongeFixation (Score: 277): Why aren't Tata paying up? 🤣

1ntbtvv,"""Used approved"" car - I think I'm done with main dealers","Update: I had a proper look under the undercarriage today and you can see it's clearly hit something where there's a ton of kerb rash. The dealer has agreed this shouldn't have been missed and has agreed a fix. Thanks to those who left helpful comments.

The last few cars I've bought have been in private sales. I've actually found these pretty good: you can get a vibe from someone straight away, the owner actually keeps the full service history receipts and you can get a sense of how they've treated the car.

Anyway, I decided for my next car I wanted a Toyota. I found a pretty nice looking car around 20 minutes away. I go to inspect it and notice a slight panel gap between the front bumper and headlight. I do know Toyota's have a few documented issues with these and it didn't seem so bad on the day so I didn't think too much of it.

Anyway, I drive the car home and take another look. Either I was blinded by the bright lights of the Toyota dealership or the problem somehow  worsened on the way home. You can clearly see the top clip isn't in its guide. I gave the paint a good check over and it's definitely OEM, the car is also HPI clear.

In any case, is this really what you would expect on a ""used approved"" car from the main dealer? The dealer is now claiming ""sold as seen"", which doesn't really stack up for a main dealer. Toyota UK are similarly not interested. My bodyshop said they could fix it in 10 minutes, but if that's the case why couldn't the dealer be bothered?

I've also got a stone chip and what looks like a large scuff under the front undercarriage. Perhaps it's my fault for not getting on my hands and knees but this I'm my view is beyond wear and tear. 

Has anyone got some advice on the best way forward? I'm reluctant to reject the car on the basis of a simple cosmetic fix but in my view, it isn't good enough and the dealer needs to fix it.

Very, very disappointing given the car has an immaculate service history and the interior was obviously well looked after.",2,1759131320.0,41,CartalkUK,1759260839,2025-09-29 07:35:20,2025-09-30 19:33:59,"g_t_l (Score: 20): If everything else with the car is spot on I would personally take this one on the chin.

We're looking at getting a Maserati for my girlfriend but, realistically, we know that the Porsche will be the far more reliable car, so I won't be getting rid of that.

Porsche dealerships (sorry... centres) really are great at service and support, I've heard a few people complain but by far more praise them. The parts at dealerships are cheaper than 3rd party, the service is exemplary and the international community etc are excellent.

Only thing I would say is the diesels really aren't that fun to drive. They are absolutely excellent cars and entirely fast enough for whatever you'd need - however if you want to get into it and feel like you are driving a Porsche/Maserati then please consider a petrol.

ninja_moth (Score: 2): I've no experience with either marque, but I see lots of Maserati are super trouble free, until they have a problem. On the other hand I see Porsche as reliable if maintained, at wicked cost, but I don't hear about single points of failure often."

2) When you replaced the battery did you reset the BMS.

If you don't reset the BMW in a BMW of that era, it thinks it's an old, worn battery still, so the alternator won't be outputting correctly for that battery and it will either not charge it, or it'll over charge it.

That voltage however when the engine is running, isn't terrible, but it is lower than it should be, first start should be 14-15v, and then it should come down to 13-14v once everything has settled down, engine has warmed up, and it's replaced the charge used to crank.
