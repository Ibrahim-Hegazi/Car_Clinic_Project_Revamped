1m8errs,1.5L Chevy Malibu 2019 crank no start ~90k miles,"My wife and I have a chevy malibu that has a Crank no start. I'm no mechanic but I can move around the basics of car repair. 
Previously the car had a situation where it would completely die at stop signs when the auto stop would trigger (no way to turn it off) and would come back if the car is turned completely off and back on.  Had an error code with MAF so i had cleaned, then replaced the MAF and engine air filter. No luck. Cleaned the throttle body and the error code went away and car ran like normal again. 
Recently it started back up until suddenly in the drive way one morning it went crank no start.  Cleaned the throttle body again with no change.  Replaced and no change.  Continued to have MAF code, as well as crank shaft position sensor code.  Replaced both crank shaft sensors, still no luck.  Mobile mechanic came out and said it must be the PCM and needs to be replaced by a dealer. 
 Had it towed to the dealer. There they did a fuel check and said somehow we had bad gas in the tank and replaced the gas but no fix. Chevy checked the PCM and found no problems, reprogrammed the ECM. No fix.  Double checked all parts replaced and everything was in place correctly. 
At this point they have two error codes that are different than the ones brought in.  Car still won't start but if they try for 10-15 minutes and the car gets warm it will actually crank up but the moment it's put into gear it dies again. They said fuel pump module goes out often and recommended replacing that.  Still no fix.  Next recommended replacing the fuse block since there was signs of corrosion.  Didn't make sense to me but that was the only option they gave and still had no luck.  
They're now saying they tried to get in touch with GM and the best idea they have is its either electrical or fuel delivery. They claim there's no way to check the fuel injectors or fuel pump but those would be their best guess, both very pricy to fix.  I feel like I'm at my witts end and don't know what to do next other than just try to get rid of the thing.

Lean codes can be any number of things.


You're either not getting enough fuel, or there is an intake leak past the MAF sensor putting in to i much air.


The EGR valve can also leak causing this.

If they are relatively new say more than 8 mm then take it back to where you got your brakes done otherwise you were due for drakes. If your rotors are warped there's no fix other than turning them or replacing them. Most mechanics would bother doing any further diag other than driving.

I'm having a really annoying issue with the wipers on my 2019 Toyota Corolla SUN (it's the non-hybrid model, 1.6L 1ZR engine), and I'm hoping someone here might have experienced something similar or can offer some insight.

The main problem is that the wipers frequently get stuck in the middle of the windshield. This isn't consistent, but it happens a lot. I can have days where it doesn't happen at all but recently it's always happening.

Additionally, when I use the windshield washer fluid, the wipers will often make many, many passes – way more than usual – before eventually getting stuck in the middle again. When they do get stuck, whether it's mid-swipe or after spraying, I usually have to fiddle with the wiper stalk by turning them on and off or trying different speeds until they finally decide to go back down to their resting position. It's pretty frustrating, especially when driving in the rain.

I took it to the official Toyota dealership, but of course, the wipers were working perfectly fine while it was there, so they told me they couldn't diagnose the issue. My current mechanic (not an official Toyota dealer) mentioned it could be a number of things. I'm hoping to get some more specific ideas to help focus his diagnosis.

My mechanic opened the door, cleaned the tracks, and said it was likely a silicone issue, so I used WD-40 silicone spray and that fixed it for a while. But one day at the beach it got stuck again and I had to force it closed. Today it goes down and up fine the first time, but after that it stops responding. If I get out, lock the car, then unlock and get back in, it works again — but only once. Anyone know what could be causing this?

Had an issue where my car wouldn't start yesterday (2005 Accord 2.4 V4 auto). Anyway, I turned the ignition, and nothing happened - No crank, no starter sounds, nothing. I kept trying 20 times, and then maybe on the 21st time, it finally worked. During all this time, the dash lights seemed to turn on when I unsuccessfully tried to turn on the car. This also had also happened a 2-3 weeks ago, although the car worked after the third turn (and had been perfect until this incident).

Worth noting that I had the battery and starter tested at a place when it happened a few weeks ago, and the guy said that both seemed fine. The same guy also cleaned one of the battery terminals, although he said he wasn't sure if that would have been the issue. So, I'm kinda wondering what you guys think? I also noticed that maybe an hour before it happened, I tried to put up my driver side window (while the car was off), and it seemed a bit sluggish going up. It's probably not related, but I thought I'd include that fact anyway.

I started the car this morning successfully about 10 times in a row. My guess is that a test on the starter / battery would probably say that they're healthy. Overall, I really would like to resolve this, while at the same time not spend money on repairs that are not needed.

 if you unplug the engine coolant temp sensor. it forces the computer to put on all three relays giving you high speed fans.. 

 you are going what..   yep. its insane but it works..

 in low speed fan.. only relay 12 is turned on..  feeding thru the left fan.. backwards thru the normally closed contact on relay 15 and thru the right fan to get to ground.. so both fans turn on at low speed.. 

 when the computer calls for high speed fans.. all three relays come on.. relay 15 switches and connects the left fan directly to ground and  relay 14 comes on and gives the right fan direct power.. 

 do not try to operate the relays manually with the covers off.. because you have ground and positive 15 and 14.. you can blow the fuse as you are not as fast as the computer is at turning both 15 and 14 at the exact same time..

 if you have had severe death wobble or hit pot holes at high speed or like doing washboard roads at high speed..  i hit a patch of washboard pavement on the freeway late one night.. i knew it was there and forgot . my ford van went over it and actually was just clipping the tops of the washboard which is fun with a fully loaded van ..  i got off about 2 miles from home to drop off something and the tapered pin from the drag link thru the pitman arm sheared off while i was parallel parking.. not doing 65 on the freeway..  it was obvious damage from the washboard as both sides were cracked and just a strip in the middle was left. 

 please also ..  jack up one end of your front axle at a time.. just so the tire is about an inch off the floor.. with a block of wood and a pry bar.. lift the tire while eyeballing the ball joints .. you should not have vertical play.. swing the prybar to put side to side force on your ball joints .. they should not move  sideways..

Park car on level ground 

Remove dipstick and clean oil off with paper towel, 

then put dipstick back in fully, 

and pull back out once more, 

then the true level of your oil will be visible on the dipstick

lampministrator (Score: 2): OK that hashed area is the ""indicator"".  The more full the oil is, the ""higher"" the level will move up toward the handle of the dipstick.  Right now your oil looks full.  Technically speaking, as long as your oil is somewhere in the hashed area you are ok.  If the oil level were halway through the hash marks, that typically means you are a 1/4 to 1/2 quart low.  If it's at the bottom of the hashed area (near the tip of the stick), it typically means you are 3/4 to 1 quart low.  If it's at the top of the hashed area (like it appears to be now), your oil level is full.

HOWEVER You need to check the oil after letting the vehicle sit on a level surface for at least a minute with the engine turned off to get a truly accurate reading.  And dip/wipe at least twice to get a accurate reading as well.

lampministrator (Score: 1): You could be masking another issue by doing what you did here.  There are a few reasons that a properly adjusted lifter will tick .. A weak valve spring ...  A sticky valve ...etc etc

You won't hurt your cam by doing what you did.  BUT what you ARE doing is not allowing that valve to close all the way.  On an intake, that's especially concerning, because you have raw fuel sitting on the other side of that valve, and even a small quarter thousandths opening is enough to burn by and start burning your valve up.  In severe cases you can even damage the valve seat.  You covered up the symptom but may have caused another problem.

If you are certain you lashed them correctly, you may need to delve deeper as to why the tick is still here.  It's a pretty simple setup.  Push rod bent, weak valve spring, worn lifter, or a sticky valve.  Hope this helps, and good luck!"

My guess would be that the connector / wire harness for the missing fog light was dangling and flopping in the wind, which eventually wore through the insulation on the wires causing them to short catastrophically, catch on fire, and burn everything around the shorted wires - including your ambient air sensor. I’m assuming the switch for your fog light was in the “on” position.

When the sensor (which is just a thermocouple) doesn’t give a recognized response, the readout just defaults to some pre-set limit. That’s why you’re seeing -40.

Check your battery terminals for tightness and corrosion.  

You can have the battery load tested at any auto parts store, Walmart, Sam's Club, Costco, etc. in or out of the car, so if you can remove it and catch a ride, try it that way.

If that's all good, check the condition of the big cables, both positive and ground, between the starter, battery, and alternator, in particular the ends of the cables and the terminals.  If you have a multimeter, disconnect at least one end of each of the big cables and check for resistance.  Anything more than a dead short suggests the cable is full of corrosion.

1m86fcg,[Advice] 2013 Jeep Grand Cherokee overheating + codes P0520 &amp; P0325 — what should I do next?,"Looking for some advice on my 2013 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited (3.6L V6, \~112k miles). I'm not a car expert, just trying to stay ahead of an overheating issue before it gets worse.

I scanned it and found these two codes:

* **P0520** — Engine Oil Pressure Sensor/Switch malfunction
* **P0325** — Knock Sensor 1 Circuit (Bank 1)

**The problem:**  
The car starts to **overheat after about 10 minutes** of driving. I can usually go a few miles before the temp gauge climbs and the warning light comes on. I filled it with a full jug of coolant, but it’s burning through it quickly — like I have to refill every time I drive. So I suspect a **coolant leak**, though I haven't found any puddles under the car.

I looked up the knock sensor and oil pressure switch — parts are pretty cheap online. But again, I’m not much of a car guy. I can maybe do basic stuff but nothing too technical.

**Questions:**

1. Could either of those codes be causing the overheating?
2. Should I go ahead and replace those parts myself, or is this a bigger issue?
3. Would it make sense to **buy the parts and take them to a shop like Pep Boys** and have them do the work?
4. Any other components I should be checking or replacing while I’m at it (thermostat, water pump, radiator, etc)?

The loss of that much coolant with no obvious leaks is indicative of internal leakage.

Then you open up the bleeding nippel on the caliper farthest away, usually rear right.

Close it as soon as the fluid flows and Do it on the other side too.

And always check that enough brake fluid is in the reservoir, i usually overfill it and then drain it on the last caliper until it is at max.

OEM sensors are expensive but cheap sensors cause problems.  Sometimes sensors are bad right out of the box.

Gas mileage is directly related having a function MAF sensor.  Without it, the PCM will default to ""open loop"" mode and add extra fuel to keep the engine running because it doesn't know how much air is entering the engine.

There's a few other things that can cause a MAF sensor related code like the wiring and connector, but it's usually the sensor.  

The real solution here is to get a Nissan OEM sensor, or at least a quality brand like Hitachi, Denso or NTK.  You might be able to get a used but good OEM sensor from a junk yard for a fraction of the price of a new one.  Sometimes they offer a short warranty period to make sure you get a good one.

1m7zbo6,Coolant expansion but no vacuum recovery,"I’ve been chasing a frustrating coolant issue on my 2011 G37 sedan (VQ37VHR, 7AT) for months. The problem is that while coolant expands normally into the overflow tank during driving, it never returns back to the radiator after cooling down — meaning vacuum recovery isn’t happening. The system holds pressure and vacuum perfectly (confirmed with tests), there’s no overheating, and a combustion gas test was negative. I’ve replaced the radiator cap (OEM), radiator neck (engine-mounted), neck O-ring, overflow tank, overflow hose, clamps, thermostat, and had the system vacuum filled twice with fresh coolant. After driving, the coolant rises to the reservoir as expected, but it stays there after a full overnight cooldown — even though the hoses go soft, indicating vacuum should be forming.

Usually the system will suck it back if there is coolant missing but if the system is already full it won't.

As long as the coolant in the reservoir doesn't drop it should be fine.

Is there anything they may have done incorrectly during the oil change to cause the head gasket to blow?? I don’t know much about cars but it seems so random. The head gasket is a SUPER costly repair, which they don’t do, so it doesn’t seem like they’re trying to extract business from me.

1m7uwj0,Break Pad Replacement Options,"Brief Intro:

Hi guys, I am just about ready to switch out my breaks soon on my 2018 Hyundai Kona SE. I am thinking ahead for Black Friday/Cyber Monday and wanted to know what are good alternatives for replacing the stock break pads. I know they are ""Hyundai Disc Brake Pad Set S5810-13QA5-0NA"", but it lists no specifics on thickness, or how the pads are held together.  Which goes towards differences in different type of break performances, and type of vehicle needs. I mostly would see responses from sedan, or performance race track cars that would give out suggestions, however; for daily commutes I don't know how helpful they are.

Little Digging of Knowledge:

I did a little bit of digging to familiarize myself with how break pads work, types, and different road conditions specific to driving habits. However, it just left me with a little bit of doubt because it still does not answer for my own specifics of my car type. I understand that Ceramic pads are best for breaking overall, but they need to be warmed up to keep on doing that. Semi-Ceramic seem to be best for breaking quicker, but over time; depending on your breaking frequency can wear them down. I know Semi-Metallic are more for daily commute, but don't last long. Also, break pad life and quality depend on which ones we're installed on the rotors previously. I am guessing for my case it was the original Hyundai pads, but lists nothing if they are built on a galvanized steel backing plate against dust.

Past Car:

2001 Mazda 3 with lots of break dust and noise. Think I bought AutoZone breaks that always squeaked, so I don't know if it was the install or I just didn't know how to pick them.

Driving Distance &amp; Habits:

I am just back and forth from work 5 days a week, and groceries 1 time. Daily commute is 17 miles total each day, off days for chores ranges from 5 miles, 12, to 20 if pushing it. On freeways, maybe twice a year for couples of miles of 100 perhaps. I am not a fast driver, and have only hard braked twice this year.

I live in Las Vegas:

1. Over population, and unpredictability is ever increasing now.

I know it's true all over the world, but just dealing with out own types of unpredictability here. Especially when it comes to distracted driving, overbearing people cutting you off, and just homeless people acting erratic. Yes I threw them in because it's been happening way more often now. Has incidents where a child ran across the road in diapers, then a homeless guy standing in the middle of the road playing with legos, or now it's just badly dimmed streets because of copper theft.

2) Summer heats are just increasing

Summer heats are getting brutal here every year, and this tagged along with overbearing, and sudden snaps of road rage is adding on to the predictability and goes towards my understanding of warped rotors and stopping power needed.

What I am leaning towards:

I am on [RockAuto.com](http://RockAuto.com), and am leaning towards either...

1. RAYBESTOS EHT1855AH &amp; RAYBESTOS EHT2094H
2. BOSCH BC2094 &amp; BOSCH BC2188
3. Just buy the ones it came with, but it only gives me a year of durability from the manufactures site.

I don't know if I can mix and match Front/Rear, but then I am guessing that would mess with the lifespan of the front pads.

I do know that Akebono is top of the line, but they do not offer for rear breaks.

So with all this in mind, would my thinking leaning towards these break options be the correct ones to cover break dust, rotor warping due to heat, and unpredictable stops for my vehicle/habits? I'd like to buy either OEM, or Premium to lasts me longer.

Honest to God, I just don't know unless you try them. I Just don't want to make the wrong decision again, like I think I did countless times going with what AutoZone would tell me.",2,1753331415.0,7,MechanicAdvice,1753465898,2025-07-24 04:30:15,2025-07-25 17:51:38,"mlw35405 (Score: 2): On a Hyundai Kona OEM is going to be your best bet for normal use. More aggressive friction material is going to wear the rotors down faster, produce more dust and they tend to squeak during light breaking. Carbon metallic pads will last forever but  your wheels will always be covered in black dust. Cheap ass pads have inferior friction material and don't stop as well and don't last very long along with other issues. OEM friction composition of any well known name brand ""OEM equivalent"" is going to give the best performance, minimal noise and dust and longest rotor life. Side note have you ever considered investing in a Comma 3x?

1m7uoej,A lot to unfold here. But lots of DTC’s and no where to start more down below,"So I bought a 2019 mustang gt from a used car dealership, a couple weeks later I had to bring it back to be fixed because the entire exhaust system needed replaced, the first set of codes you’ll see is before I took it in. Car was gone for 2 months, got the car back last week and it drives much better but codes are still popping back up, the few pictures is the invoice of everything that was replaced to it, after I got the car back and the codes popped back up I checked the spark plugs/injectors and they were good, replaced the camshaft position sensor with a ford oem part and that didn’t work. I’m at a loss on what to do next as I don’t want to take it back up to the dealership as they take forever with the warranty claims and everything. Is there anything I can check to see if a loose wire is causing the issue? Here are my issues down below 

1. Car drives much more better but I feel like it shifts to erratic 
2. Sometimes the CEL with flash along with a ticking sound coming from the passenger side and my exhaust sounds rough but it goes away after 10 seconds even less sometimes 
3. My acceleration feels off, idk if it’s the 10r80 transmission that shifts to 10th gear quick but my throttle response doesn’t feel right imo (first v8 and mustang so maybe that’s normal) 
4. I have several options available to get it looked at by a mechanic shop in my hometown, ford dealership is a little bit farther but are very expensive, and last option is to take it back to the dealership and maybe take another month or 2 to get it back

**\*MORNING UPDATE**\*\*\*\*\*\*\* *as noted by commenters, i let the truck sit overnight &amp; used a rag to wipe down my oil dipstick. i checked it 3x times, wiping off, re-inserting &amp; pulling out to check each time. it was very clear after letting the truck sit overnight that my oil level is indeed WITHIN the ""safe"" mark line on the dipstick. however, i've crawled underneath &amp; i've spotted some greasy/oil/wetness on some areas above, that may be the reason for the check engine light. i will make a new post about that with pictures included. i'm still working on getting a code reader or making it to o reilly's &amp; plan on updating this thread with all other new info. THANK YOU so far for all comments* \*

i have a 5.7 V8 dodge ram 1500, that i've done my own oil changes for the last 15k miles. i do the same procedure each time &amp; on the same driveway (very slight incline). this time is the only time i've experience something like below...

yesterday evening i:

\- replaced oil filter, lubricated the top &amp; filled it about 1/2 way with new clean oil (like i've always done)

\- once all old oil stopped dripping out, i then replaced old drain plug with a new one

i slowly filled back up with new, 5w-20 full synthetic, again as always. i would only pour little by little until all 7 quarts were put in. the dipstick read just nearly to the top of the safe/cross-hatch line area.

i started it up yesterday right after the oil change, no weird noises, no smoke, no check engine light, no dripping anywhere, no oil light, normal oil gauge reading.

**however today on initial start up, i immediately hear like a buzzing noise that lasts a 2-3 seconds ( i thought the radio was on some AM station with feedback/humming, but the radio was off) &amp; the steady orange check engine light came on.**

**after i see my check engine light turn on today, i shut the truck off &amp; tried to check the dipstick. i pull it out, wipe it, put it back in &amp; pull out once more. there is oil that tracks all the way up the dipstick**.

is that because the truck had just been started &amp; oil got splashed around inside? the very top of the dipstick hose (on the outside) looks a little sweaty or moist as well. i will wait until tomorrow morning to re-check it under the sunlight to see if i can get a clearer reading after letting it sit overnight.

all my gauges are still reading normal (normal oil pressure, etc.), no smoke, no dripping, etc. the engine doesn't sound different.

i'm very hesitant to get it on the road though.

family &amp; neighbors keep telling me if i did the same thing as the last 2x times with no problems, which i did, that i should just drive it for a few miles &amp; things will straighten out. but i don't want to destroy my truck if there is an issue.",1,1753330278.0,9,MechanicAdvice,1753465898,2025-07-24 04:11:18,2025-07-25 17:51:38,"nimbleVaguerant (Score: 1): Code?

1m7qgmg,"AC compressor blowing fuses after replacement, 05 Dakota","AC started acting up about a month ago, it would blow cold for a few minutes and then warm for a few. Finally it gave out and stopped completely. I could not get the clutch to engage even when jumping from battery to coil terminals. 

Spent a good amount of time watching videos and learning how an automotive AC functions. Compressor has two wires and I was getting 12v at the terminals. I did a resistance check and I had 70k ohms on the coil. To me this was indicating a failed coil.

Ordered a new compressor and evacuated system. I went out and bought gauges and a vacuum pump and attempted to do this myself (figured the new tools were less than the cost of a taking it somewhere). I installed the new compressor and ran the vacuum pump for an hour and let it sit for a half hour. It was still holding a vacuum. I hooked up a new can of coolant and opend the low pressure valve. The gauges were both reading 100. I turned the truck on with the AC and blower at full. No engagement of the clutch. At this point I think I made my mistake. I did some googling and found advice saying to jump the AC clutch relay. 

I used spare wire and tried jumping the 30 and 86 terminals, no luck. I tried jumping to 86a as well. I then took wire and tried to jump directly from the battery to the terminals of the compressor. No luck. At one point while trying this I believe that I accidentally bumped the wires across both terminals. The coil is reading one ohm in resistance now, which I believe is too low.

The AC clutch fuse is blown, upon replacement it fails as soon as the AC is turned on. When I disconnect the the AC compressor and turn on the AC the fuse is not blowing. To me this indicates it is not a shorted wire or an issue with the relay. Again the fuse was not blown originally prior to the compressor.

Now some backstory, my car was gifted to me and before hand my grandma got her AC fixed and I'm thinking that this part  is NOT clipped on properly and it's causing dirty air in my engine.

I've done off road driving for over 20 years and run both booted and un-booted shocks; they don't really increase the life of the shock and can hide problems.  I prefer to run the shocks naked these days so I can spot leaks and clean dirt and debris off the pistons and seals.

I doubt these dust boots are causing any noise, it's more likely that something else is just as worn out."

The front and back pads are basically brand new and all three shops have said the brakes look in good condition other than this mystery sound. The Jiff Lube guys cleaned the front right calipers. Still happening. It’s a low groan that gets progressively worse, and only happens after I’ve been driving for a few minutes. Really only happens at low speeds, and brakes very well in general. Doesn’t make sound from high speeds. But, if I stop from a high speed and then kinda stop and go testing brakes, I’ll hear it. It doesn’t really happen if I’m breaking uphill, but definitely on flat ground and downhill. It doesn’t sound overtly metallic or like a scratch/grind really. The guys I usually go to said rotors are fine. The two shops drove it and of course it wouldn’t make the sound, but it really only happens after heated up. Finally the jiffy lube guy got in with me and validated what I was hearing, but the caliper cleaning didn’t help. It’s a much worse sound in person but wondering if anyone here has thoughts.

I bought a 2014 Honda Civic Hybrid EX-L new 12 years ago from this dealership. When I bought it I got remote start installed (through the dealership). 

Recently, my battery has been dying. When I jump it and drive it every day it's fine but if I spend two days or more without starting it, it dies. The battery was relatively new.

I suspected that the battery drain was from my Keyless Entry because I also noticed that the door would unlock before I even got to the handle. Like walking up to the door it would unlock. 

So I brought my car to the dealership. They confirmed there's a draw but they want me to remove the remote start and charge me $950 to do it. When I asked if they could just disconnect it for the draw diagnostic they said no they can only remove it. That price doesn't include them putting it back in. Something about how the wires are spliced in, I'm assuming it's connected to the security system and other places.

What do I do? Take it to a local mechanic? I feel like they are trying to scam me here. Should I just ask for a new handle since I suspect that's the draw anyway? Can I ask them to just disconnect the keyless entry? I feel like there's a ton of ways to diagnose this without fully removing my remote start.

1m7lki2,Help :( ticking / rattling noises,"Hi everyone,

A few months ago, I bought a 2012 Honda Insight (Hybrid, 1.3 i-VTEC, ~228,000 km / 142,000 miles). It’s actually my second Insight — my first one got totaled while I was on holiday by a drunk driver who crashed into it while it was parked 😢

After I got back home, I needed a car quickly, and I loved my old one so much that I went with another Insight. It seemed to be in good condition, but sadly I think I’ve been scammed — it had hidden issues and was poorly maintained.

The biggest issue right now is a ticking or clicking sound that appears between 1500 and 2000 RPM, only under load. Here’s what I’ve noticed:

•	⁠Only when driving — never when idling •	⁠Not present when the engine is cold (first 5–10 minutes) •	⁠Always under load, even with very light acceleration, Rpm related •	⁠The sound disappears above 2000 RPM •	⁠i can “hold” the sound steady by keeping my foot in just the right position •	⁠Not related to wheel speed, road speed, or air conditioning •	⁠It doesn’t sound like a worn bearing — no grinding, whining, or metallic rubbing. It’s more of a sharp, rhythmic ticking or clicking.

The car still drives well, pulls fine, no power loss, no CVT slipping. There is a check engine light on, but otherwise the engine idles and runs smoothly. Multiple mechanics have looked at it, but they didn’t hear the noise until I drove the car with them.

It burns a lot of oil — about 1 liter every 600–800 km (400–500 miles). I’ve heard this is common with older Hondas, but it still seems extreme. •	⁠Recent oil and filter changes didn’t change anything •	⁠The water pump pulley has a very slight wobble, but my dad and others say it doesn’t sound like a bearing issue •	⁠Heat shields and exhaust have been visually checked — nothing seems loose

Possible causes people have suggested:

•	⁠Piston rings (oil control rings): I’ve heard there was a known service bulletin or recall for this engine — the rings were too narrow and tend to stick, possibly causing ticking or piston slap. •	⁠Hybrid electric motor (IMA system): Some people think it might be internal bearing or drivetrain wear. •	⁠CVT transmission: A trusted mechanic suspects the noise could be coming from the metal drive belt or the pulleys inside the CVT, especially under load.

These are all just guesses at this point, but I’m really hoping someone here might recognize the specific RPM-dependent ticking pattern or has seen something similar.

I’m not a native English speaker and don’t know much about car terminology, so I apologize if anything isn’t clear!

I’ve attached two audio recordings — I held the gas steady to “lock in” the sound when it was most noticeable:

1m85dew,All four of my tires keep losing air — not sure if I should replace them or not,"Hey everyone,

Since April, I’ve been driving my first car, and lately I’ve been using it quite a lot. Everything seemed fine — I even passed my PVI at the end of June — but now I’m dealing with something really annoying: all four of my tires systematically are slowly losing pressure.

About two weeks after the inspection, I checked the tire pressure and they were all around 1.7 bar, with one even at 1.6. I’ve had to top them up twice in the last two weeks, and visually they also look a bit flatter than before.

I’ve looked around online and I’m seeing different possible causes — from weak tire sidewalls to valve stem issues or even poor quality equipment being used during the last service.

In a bit of a panic, I ordered new tires (Hankook), which should arrive today. But now I’ve realized my current ones are actually still quite new — three of them are from week 50 of 2023, and one from week 12 of 2023. They're Vredesteins, so I assumed the quality would be decent.

I asked my dad about it, but he’s never had this issue before. I’m really new to anything car-related, so I honestly have no idea what the best thing to do is. I plan on visiting a local tire shop soon, but I thought I’d check here first in case someone has experienced something similar or has any advice.

Spray some penetrating oil on it (not wd-40), let it sit a few hours and apply heat around the bolt on the drain pan, more penetrating oil.

It shouldn't be corroded like a rusty bolt as there should be oil on the threads but just try it, will only help.

Then just make sure you're losening it with the appropriate size socket and braker bar and hit it with your purse, or a impact gunz it's probably what a mechanic would do.

Worst case your destroy the pan and need a new pan/ gasket.

I'm trying to track down a car that meant a lot to my family — my grandfathers **1968 Oldsmobile Cutlass S Holiday Coupe**, originally licensed in **Oregon** in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It had the black Oregon license plate: **D 56497**.

Here’s what I know about the car:

* It was a **1968 Cutlass S 2-door hardtop (Holiday Coupe)**
* Factory color: likely **Jade Gold Metallic** (dark green with gold flakes)
* The photo below was taken sometime around the late ’60s or early ’70s
* It had **dual hood louvers**, **rally-style wheels**, and **whitewall tires**

I’m hoping someone might:

* Recognize the car from a show, auction, barn, or garage
* Know if it’s still in Oregon or was sold out of state
* Own it now or know who might

1m89rzp,2016 Lexus CT200h - Cycling squeak noise on driver side,"Hi all, 

I(F) wanted to figure out what this noise is coming from my bottom driver side, I’m guessing it’s brakes/rotors or wheel hub but wanted to confirm. My car is roughly at 95k miles and tbh I missed the 60k service that changes out all fluids (I know, I’m a dummy for not getting it). I also got brand new rotors when I first got the car in 2022-23, new tires, alignment &amp; wheel balance a few times since then. 

When I drove this morning on the highway 70-80mph, I heard a slight squeak noise but thought it was someone else. 
As I started to slow down to 25-40mph, it got louder and more obnoxious, it was me Barry. 
The noise occurred when turning my wheel &amp; driving below 40mph but would lower as I start to brake. 

I got to my destination and left, the noise would cycle &amp; squeak even Louder until I reached a certain speed (55-65mph) and the noise stopped for the entire ride home on the highway. When I exited and slowed down to 30-45mph, the sound went away as if it never happened. 

What do? I have videos of the sound while leaving the parking lot, if needed, I could DM them to whomever would like to listen for insight.

1m7qsgm,"2016 Lincoln MKX — Catalytic Converters, Misfires, and Possible Shop Screw-Up?","Looking for some advice or insight here.

My wife has a 2016 Lincoln MKX with the 3.7L V6. Both the driver-side and passenger-side catalytic converters have gone bad. We took it to the dealership and a separate well rated shop - both quoted us right around $6,000 for parts and labor.

At the time, we weren’t noticing any major issues - no overheating, no strange smells, no noticeable power loss or rough idling - so we figured it wasn’t super urgent and put it off.

Fast forward: we recently had new rotors, brakes, and a brake fluid flush done. After the service, I noticed the shop had overfilled the brake fluid to the point where it was spilling out of the reservoir. Shortly after that, the car started misfiring on almost every cylinder and we now have a blinking check engine light that throws it into limp mode.

We tried swapping out the spark plugs, but obviously, that didn’t fix it.

So here’s what I’m wondering:
	1.	Is $6K really the going rate to replace both  cats?
	2.	Has anyone dealt with a similar issue and found a more affordable solution?
	3.	Could the shop be responsible for the misfires due to the brake fluid overflow? I know brake fluid is corrosive as hell and I’m wondering if it could’ve caused damage that’s now leading to these misfires.

Whether it's normal or not, I'm not sure, but if it's really hot and the radiator maybe has a bit of air in it, I can see how the engine temp may rise a bit above normal.

1m7lmbe,Help:( Honda ticking noise,"Hi everyone,

A few months ago, I bought a 2012 Honda Insight (Hybrid, 1.3 i-VTEC, ~228,000 km / 142,000 miles). It’s actually my second Insight — my first one got totaled while I was on holiday by a drunk driver who crashed into it while it was parked 😢

After I got back home, I needed a car quickly, and I loved my old one so much that I went with another Insight. It seemed to be in good condition, but sadly I think I’ve been scammed — it had hidden issues and was poorly maintained.

The biggest issue right now is a ticking or clicking sound that appears between 1500 and 2000 RPM, only under load. Here’s what I’ve noticed:

•	⁠Only when driving — never when idling •	⁠Not present when the engine is cold (first 5–10 minutes) •	⁠Always under load, even with very light acceleration, Rpm related •	⁠The sound disappears above 2000 RPM •	⁠i can “hold” the sound steady by keeping my foot in just the right position •	⁠Not related to wheel speed, road speed, or air conditioning •	⁠It doesn’t sound like a worn bearing — no grinding, whining, or metallic rubbing. It’s more of a sharp, rhythmic ticking or clicking.

The car still drives well, pulls fine, no power loss, no CVT slipping. There is a check engine light on, but otherwise the engine idles and runs smoothly. Multiple mechanics have looked at it, but they didn’t hear the noise until I drove the car with them.

It burns a lot of oil — about 1 liter every 600–800 km (400–500 miles). I’ve heard this is common with older Hondas, but it still seems extreme. •	⁠Recent oil and filter changes didn’t change anything •	⁠The water pump pulley has a very slight wobble, but my dad and others say it doesn’t sound like a bearing issue •	⁠Heat shields and exhaust have been visually checked — nothing seems loose

Possible causes people have suggested:

•	⁠Piston rings (oil control rings): I’ve heard there was a known service bulletin or recall for this engine — the rings were too narrow and tend to stick, possibly causing ticking or piston slap. •	⁠Hybrid electric motor (IMA system): Some people think it might be internal bearing or drivetrain wear. •	⁠CVT transmission: A trusted mechanic suspects the noise could be coming from the metal drive belt or the pulleys inside the CVT, especially under load.

These are all just guesses at this point, but I’m really hoping someone here might recognize the specific RPM-dependent ticking pattern or has seen something similar.

I’m not a native English speaker and don’t know much about car terminology, so I apologize if anything isn’t clear!

I am going to venture a guess and suggest that th engine in your vehicle might not have received proper oil changes at the correct intervals, thus you have the oil buring issue, which you perhaps did not have in your previous insight.  I think your noise is potentially a stretched timing chain and that rpm is allowing the slack to still be sufficient to make that engine noise.  and would often present as a ticking sound, but could go away when the chain is slung around at higher speeds in the engine.  A shop could remove the valve cover and do some checking on the chain wear.   Personally if it was my car I would find another engine that was lower miles, which is a bit of a risk, or do a light overhaul on your existing engines with rings, bearings and timing chain components, but that is not inexpensive.  You may want to evaluate other alternatives.  If you could find a lower mileage engine from a wrecking yard, that would be the lowest cost solution or even a replacement engine from Honda is worth pricing out. Sometimes dealer engines are not outrageous and have guarantees.  Assuming you love the car."
1m8egqi,2007 Chrysler Town and Country,"So, about a year ago I attempted an engine swap with a friend for this vehicle. The original motor is a 3.8L V6 and we (attempted) to install a slightly less powerful 3.3L V6 of the same manufacturer. we hooked the hoses up, bolted everything, connected electrical systems (except for a couple that did not have a home on the 3.3) and attempted to start the car. The car will crank endlessly but does not want to start. Is this an issue with a computer (PCM or ECU)? The chances are high. Is it an issue with the camshaft or crankshaft sensors (which may be related to the PCM/ECU issue)? I understand we did not do enough research on engine swaps and probably made a rookie mistake. I lost a lot of money on this car and would absolutely love to drive it again. Though, I'm fully prepared for answers telling me that the total cost to get it driving again will be $1500+.

Hydraulic Lifter Problems:
Hydraulic lifters maintain proper valve clearance by using engine oil pressure to compensate for wear and thermal expansion. A common cause of the ""knock"" is when these lifters lose their ability to maintain proper oil pressure, leading to excessive valve lash. 
Oil Pressure Issues:
Low or inconsistent oil pressure can also cause lifter noise. This can be due to a failing oil pump, clogged oil passages, or using the wrong viscosity oil. 
Camshaft or Lifter Wear:
In some cases, the camshaft lobes or the lifter rollers can wear down, causing the lifter to not function correctly and resulting in a knocking sound. 
Debris:
Debris in the oil system can also cause lifter noise by obstructing oil flow or damaging the lifters. 
 Add a quart of transmission fluid to the oil as a temporary measure to help clean varnish and potentially free up stuck lifters. 
If the lifter noise is severe, it may be necessary to inspect the camshaft lobes for wear. 
Examine the oil galleries and passages for any blockages, especially in the cylinder head. 
You said you've already had the valve lifters replaced so you may need to have a full oil pressure inspection. You could also try getting an oil change and seeing if the oil filter was clogged. If it is clogged you will need to have the oil cooler inspected as it may have gone bad and is building up metal and/or debris in the oil passageways."

1m7z9rt,Coolant expansion but no vacuum recovery,"I’ve been chasing a frustrating coolant issue on my 2011 G37 sedan (VQ37VHR, 7AT) for months. The problem is that while coolant expands normally into the overflow tank during driving, it never returns back to the radiator after cooling down — meaning vacuum recovery isn’t happening. The system holds pressure and vacuum perfectly (confirmed with tests), there’s no overheating, and a combustion gas test was negative. I’ve replaced the radiator cap (OEM), radiator neck (engine-mounted), neck O-ring, overflow tank, overflow hose, clamps, thermostat, and had the system vacuum filled twice with fresh coolant. After driving, the coolant rises to the reservoir as expected, but it stays there after a full overnight cooldown — even though the hoses go soft, indicating vacuum should be forming. The overflow system is 100% new and properly sealed. My radiator does not have a cap or internal vacuum return path — the radiator neck is separate and mounted on the engine. At this point, I’m wondering if I got a bad OEM cap or if there’s a microscopic leak at the overflow hose barb that breaks the vacuum seal. I’m open to any ideas from people who’ve fought similar issues — everything else seems to be working perfectly, yet vacuum recovery still fails.",5,1753347303.0,12,mechanic,1753465898,2025-07-24 08:55:03,2025-07-25 17:51:38,"nips927 (Score: 3): Probably your cap.

I ran over an object and had to have my radiator replaced. I brought it to a Kia dealer and they were able to get it replaced and everything seemed okay. This was earlier this year when it was still relatively cool. Then as soon as I started needing the AC I realized it wouldn't cool when I was idling. I made the mistake of not really looking into it and just waiting until I needed an oil change (~2,000 miles).

I brought it into a Midas for the oil change and specifically told them about the AC not cooling while idling. They even specifically mentioned the cooling fan when I dropped it off. I had to ask about the fan when I picked it up and they said it was fine. Realized a bit after it was doing the same thing (but cooled a bit better because they added more refrigerant).

I was fed up with it this afternoon and finally looked into. After a bit of digging and checking the relay first, I found that the Kia tech just didn't plug the cable back into the cooling fan controller 😡 Probably drove another 1,000 miles like this.

1m8815s,Custom Cluster for a school project,"I did this post on the Hyundai reddit, and one person told me i'll probably have more chance here so here we go!  
  
Hello guys! I have a personal project in my engineering program and ive decided to make a custom cluster for my car (Hyundai accent 2013 Rb)!

The first step of my project is sniffing the CAN bus to understand where is my speed and rpm meter. Also im guessing my fuel meter, transmission info (my car automatic so the P,R,N,D positions) are in the CAN bus, because i took off an old cluster and did some tests.

I asked on a forum for infos and received the cluster connectors!

I also end up powering up the cluster and some different type of lights (left signal, check engine, etc)

But as you can see, i didnt figure out how to make my speed move yet nor my transmission position. I am wondering if somebody can guide me a bit here. I don't know if it only takes the CAN bus signal or something else, because the connectors pin out has a speed input. Do i need to use it with the CAN signal at the same time? Does somebody has the CAN id's of an hyundai accent 2013 or similar plz??

I can keep yall updated on the project if yall wish!! thank you guys",2,1753372214.0,3,CarHacking,1753465898,2025-07-24 15:50:14,2025-07-25 17:51:38,"neonsphinx (Score: 2): I don't have any specific insight on this cluster, on on Hyundai. More just questions about the process. 

Do you have CAN data saved from the bus that interfaces directly with the cluster? Have you tried playing it back with the cluster removed? 

Do you have data on that bus all the way from key off, to driving and getting movement on needles? 

I know that some head units will lock you out unless you're in Park, or neutral and not moving. So there are certain triggers for behavior that need to come from other components. Maybe there's a signal from the PCM that happens during key on or start?

I, unfortunately, deal with a lot of proprietary data at work. If I had to reverse engineer a component I wouldn't bank on having an interface control specification on hand that tells me every message, word, and bit. But if you are using ""the right process"", you can accomplish a lot without necessarily knowing that ICS.

That being said. A great place to start with clusters is by marrying up OBD2 data with CAN. Speed, RPM,  fuel tank level, etc. are common pieces of data and should be a matter of looking for CAN messages with a payload that scales the same amount as the OBD2 field at the same time.

I hope that makes sense. What software are you using? I like SavvyCAN and a cheap USB-C adapter, but haven't used much else to be honest.

A mechanic told me it needed a new alternator so I replaced it with a Remy remanufactured one myself. The first time I turned the car on and off with the new alternator the problem was still there. I took the car back to the mechanic and they said they tested the voltage regulator and battery and the battery had a 2 amp parasitic draw. They said when they disconnected the alternator the issue went away.  
They are recommending a new alternator(lifetime warrantied) from them. That would cost around 900 dollars. I feel like they could be missing a more underlying issue but I don't even know where to start. Maybe take it to another mechanic? I have a near lifetime warranty on the Remy alternator so I could just replace it again.

Today I attempted to change the oil in my car myself for the first time.  
I found out that I could rent a fully equipped garage with a two-post, assymetric, hydraulic lift just across the street from my house, so I rented it for two hours. I then spent an hour and a half just trying to properly lift the car, only to eventually give up and admit defeat before I would hurt myself or damage the car.  
The problem was that my car is a small hatchback (Toyota Auris 2011), and the arms just seemed too long and the lifting points too close together. Getting all the pads aligned required positioning the car super accurately, and for me it was just impossible.  
Part of the problem was that it was the first time in my life I was using a hydraulic lift, so I wanted to be 100% sure that the rubber pads were properly positioned under the lifting points, because I was really scared of going under the car.  
I think an experienced mechanic would be able to quickly lift the car just by not placing the pads exactly at the lifting points or by having the circular pads slightly off-center, but I decided not to take any risks.  
I just wanted to ask if this is a common problem with small cars, or if it was just my clumsiness /cowardness. I feel really stupid because I spent hours preparing for the oil change, creating a detailed checklist, and making sure I had all the proper parts and tools, only to fail at step one.

My car was hit by a coworker while parked at work, and the entire front bumper was ripped off. Insurance has already inspected the damage and provided an estimate, but I believe they’ve overlooked several key issues.

I'm not very familiar with the technical terms on the invoice, so some of it is confusing to me. For context, the vehicle has 77,000 miles and was in excellent condition with no prior damage. The accident caused significant damage, including both headlights (looks like they only want to repair the one) there was surface damage to the second one and not internal damage is why I don't think they wanna fix it. the driver-side front wheel well, a cracked windshield wiper fluid reservoir, and a bent hood on the driver side.

Despite this, it looks as if the insurance company wants to repair the hood instead of replacing it, which I don't agree with. The vehicle had no previous damage, and I feel the proposed repairs are more of a temporary fix than a proper restoration.

Is it possible that the insurance company is undervaluing the cost of parts and labor? Should I be pushing back to ensure the vehicle is fully and properly repaired? I’d appreciate any guidance on how to approach this.

TLDR, Car is cursed. Love her but she a magnet for bad juju. Car started acting off after a few shop repairs, and a bag being pulled under the passenger wheel. Though bad tierod, not the tie rod. Noticed this yesterday. What’s the prognosis doc? And average price to replace motor mounts? 

I swear the cars cursed. Had two accidents, one being a month after purchase in 22, and a fairly decent rear ending on thanksgiving that resulted in my rear end from the trunk out being rebuilt.  The ‘22 accident didnt get repaired until this year. The car passed inspection for 11/23 to 11/24 but failed because the front plastic bumper was “sharp”. Was going to get the front repaired in Dec, but was rear ended before I could. Damage to the rear was more pressing to fix because the trunk was smashed in and open to the elements. Got the rear fixed in January, made the appointment to fix the front of the car for mid march, got the car back, inspected it the next day. Three weeks later I noticed that my steering felt intermittently loose, my front passenger wheel felt like it was off balance, and would occasionally start to “wobble” (ive been in a car that the tie rods have failed while on a highway, and it’s almost similar to that sensation.)
 Thought my tie rod was possibly damaged from a trash bag being pulled under that wheel during bad weather. Had a buddy check it out (works at a dealer) he said he thought it looked fine but he’s no Kia expert. Ended up saying screw it and had an alignment/ balance done figuring they would obviously be able to tell if it’s the rod while aligning it. Said everything was good. The issue felt better for like a week and then came back. I noticed yesterday while replacing my low beam, that my PCV valve hose was being vibrated pretty good/ sounded like it needs to be checked. Decided for some reason to check the passenger side mount, and was able to move it about 1/8-1/4 inch with just my thumb and pointer finger. Decided that probably isn’t good, found a way to set my phone up to record (part) of the engine on start/shifting between R/N, and D.

That’s so NOT normal mount play, right? How likely is it that I caught it in time and there’s no other serious damage?  I’m about due for an oil change, but while it’s not low, there’s definitely oil being used up somewhere as it’s smack dab at the halfway mark.

I scanned it and found these two codes:

* **P0520** — Engine Oil Pressure Sensor/Switch malfunction
* **P0325** — Knock Sensor 1 Circuit (Bank 1)

**The problem:**  
The car starts to **overheat after about 10 minutes** of driving. I can usually go a few miles before the temp gauge climbs and the warning light comes on. I filled it with a full jug of coolant, but it’s burning through it quickly — like I have to refill every time I drive. So I suspect a **coolant leak**, though I haven't found any puddles under the car.

I looked up the knock sensor and oil pressure switch — parts are pretty cheap online. But again, I’m not much of a car guy. I can maybe do basic stuff but nothing too technical.

**Questions:**

1. Could either of those codes be causing the overheating?
2. Should I go ahead and replace those parts myself, or is this a bigger issue?
3. Would it make sense to **buy the parts and take them to a shop like Pep Boys** and have them do the work?
4. Any other components I should be checking or replacing while I’m at it (thermostat, water pump, radiator, etc)?

Your PCM got unexpected voltage readings from your knock sensor.

>it’s burning through it quickly — like I have to refill every time I drive

Drop your engine beauty cover (if available), point flash light in between engine heads, inspect the oil cooler housing base. If you see your coolant there, here's your answer. If you don't see you coolant there, inspect hoses under the hood for dry coolant residues, check your oil level. This amount of coolant loss is easy to diagnose.

Avoid shops with a lot of youngsters.

You haven't diagnosed anything. When you replace parts mentioned in trouble codes, it's not diagnostic."

It did the morning I was bringing it in to do oil (I just don't do oil myself anymore).

They ran the code to and I just said while it was there might as well change it out and be done with it. 

Turns out they did an entire tune up and replaced all the plugs too and charged me for it. 

When I spoke with the manager about it they tried to tell me all the plugs were non resistor and you can't install those in a Toyota at all but they discounted everything to wipe the cost of the parts and labor on the plugs. They did give me a 10% discount on everything but they usually do anyway. He tried to say he was just super busy and forgot to tell me over the phone. Tbh I think he's lying to me because I told him several times all the plugs were brand new.

If there were NR plugs in there why would they come up as compatible in the parts store system? I mean I guess the store system just looks like for a general fit and gap and shows it. Should I keep pushing this or just let it go?

1m84f37,A/C Diagnosis Help,"Hi all, 1999 Lexus GS400. Tomorrow a mechanic friend will be properly charging my A/C and I'm trying to rule out any issues before then. So far I have:

-changed expansion valve
-changed o-rings
-changed schraders on both service ports
-filled with plain 134a (no stop leak)

Once pressure reaches 31psi the compressor engages. However, the high pressure side does not change - I'm filled to 35psi, both gauges display this with the engine running and the A/C on full blast. 

Before I spend the money on a compressor, is there any other culprit to check for? I understand that there may be a blockage but unless it's in one of the hardlines between the compressor and HP service port I don't know how it would affect it in this way. 

EDIT: When I bought this car it didn't have an o-ring at all on one of the compressor fittings.

A standard compressor should show a pressure change.  

Variable displacement compressors were pretty new technology 20 years ago, not sure if a 1999 vehicle would have one.  You can tell if it’s variable displacement as it will have a control wire to the compressor, usually at the back.  This will be a separate wire from the clutch wire.  You can try to add more refrigerant to see if it finally kicks in.  Early variable displacement compressors could take up to a minute or so of running before they started pumping good.  You could also have a control signal problem to the variable displacement solenoid."

1m83h5w,Mazda6 2007 2.3l cranks but won't start,"Hi,

  
I'm officially out of ideas now and have no idea where to go from here.

**Car background info (if it's of any use):**  
\- Partner (owner of the car) and I were on holiday for 3 weeks, came back and the car suddenly doesn't start.

\- Partner did not report any unusual behaviours or symptoms prior to our holiday.

\- I do all regular servicing of this car every 6 months/10,000km. The last service was about 9,000km ago (oil, oil filter, tranny oil and oil filter for last occasion, etc).

\- I installed a new fuel pump module in the car less than 6 months ago

\- I installed a new radiator and did a full coolant flush and replacement around 12 months ago, as well as new radiator hoses as they were blistering etc.

\- I replaced all 4 spark plugs around 12 months ago.

**Problems/Symptoms:**  
1. The car cranks/turns-over but refuses to start. If pressing the accelerator down while attempting to start the car, the engine will splutter but never start.

Troubleshooting I have done:

*1. Poured 20 litres of petrol into the tank* (she insisted it had fuel but just to be safe!)

*2. Tried jumpstarting*  
Attempted jumpstarting off my other working car in case the battery voltage was too low. No luck.

*2. Confirmed spark plugs are...""sparking?"":*  
 Took one spark plug out and placed it near the engine block, had partner try to start the car, saw the spark plug visibly arcing and creating sparks. 

*3. Confirmed fuel pump module is working:*  
Turned key in ignition to 'on', can audibly hear the fuel pump module priming the fuel line.

*4. Confirmed fuel is making it to the cylinders:*  
Took one spark plug out, asked partner to attempt starting the car, saw fuel down in the cylinder and also smelled the petrol fumes shoot out the cylinder.

*5. Thoroughly cleaned the intake throttle body:*  
The intake throttle body was so disgustingly caked that I thought perhaps the engine wasn't getting enough air. No luck unfortunately after cleaning.

*6. Tried starting the car while spraying brake cleaner down the intake throttle body:*  
Had partner start the car while i had the accordion tube from the airbox removed while I spray brake cleaner down it.

*7. Confirmed the immobiliser wasn't on/engaged on the dashboard via the little car and keylock symbol.*  
The immobiliser light was disappearing when putting the key into the ignition and trying to start, so I don't think it's the immobiliser stopping it from starting.

*8. Checked for car error codes.*  
ODB2 reader showed the car had absolutely no error codes (was thinking maybe it was the crankshaft position sensor)

*9. Tried manually resetting the ECU by taping up the two battery terminals together and leaving for 20minutes.*  
Not actually sure if this works for this model of car, but at this point I was desparate :-)

  
Anyone have any recommendations for me to try and investigate? I'm lost for ideas now ..

How important is this to address? I haven't noticed a drop in oil level or anything. They quoted $3k, which after looking around at forums seems realistic considering they have to yank the engine. 

So, worth addressing, or are we good to just keep an eye on the oil level? If it'll spiral into more serious engine damage without being fixed, we'll probably pony up and spend the money.

1m82w90,Is this drop in RPM and car shaking normal?,"I have a 2009 Toyota Camry LE with about 115k on it. Runs fine, but I've noticed for the past year the RPMs will sometimes drop a tiny bit, the car will shake rather noticeably, and then it'll go back up and be fine. The issue is very intermittent and is most noticeable while idling in park, but it can also happen in drive or reverse (e.g stopped at a red light, backing up in a parking lot). If I were to idle for say 10 mins waiting for someone, I'd estimate I see this happen like 4-5 times. 

I've tried to attach a video of the issue. As soon as the clip starts, you see the RPMs drop a bit then go up. You cannot hear or feel it from the video, but the car will be shaking rather violently during this time. I've had several folks ask me if my car is ok while riding with me when this happens and I just tell them it's because the car is old. 

Things I've done for this car:

- New battery and alternator (separate issue) 
- New air filters for engine and cabin
- new spark plugs
- Taken to 4 different mechanics. 1 suggested fuel induction service for $100. 1 said this is normal and sent me off with no charge. The last two agreed something is off, but said I'd have to drop off and pay a diagnostic fee for them to fully troubleshoot the issue. 

I finally bit the bullet and dropped it off to one of the guys, and they suggested a fuel induction service and throttle body cleaning would fix the problem. Also said the negative battery terminal needed cleaning. Issue wasn't resolved and I got charged a grand total of $500. Luckily I got a refund and was only charged a diagnostic fee of $100 when I threw a fit about the issue being there still.

Some mechanics have suggested I see if this happens when the A/C is on/off or when I roll windows down. Sometimes it seems to be triggered by the A/C being turned on/off but it's not always. This has happened with the A/C being completely off. I wanna say this happens when some sort of fan turns on and it draws power (radiator fan?). 

I was wondering if anyone here has any idea what this could be? I'm pretty close to giving up and chalking it up to my car being old.

1m7xo6f,"Coolant low, mixing different types of coolant","Long story short, just got a new used Mini Countryman 2017 1.5 petrol, manual, 150.000km, and after a couple of weeks, I got a notification that it's running hot. I checked the coolant, it's bellow min line. (When purchased from the car lot, it had all the papers that it was serviced and registered a week before I got it).

The problem is that I don't know which coolant is in there. Up to OEM MINI spec, G48 is listed, but it is not available in the area. As far as my light research goes, BMW engines also use G11, so that's what I want to go for. I don't have the facilities to do a full swap, to drain whatever's left of the old coolant and put the available G11. I want to top it off, see if it leaks. If so, will take it to the shop sooner, but if I can drive it for about a week or two with the top off, that would fit what I have piled up, and then next Friday I leave it in the shop.

My questions are the following:

* In case it's G48 there, is it safe to mix with G11?
* I also got a tip to just top it off with distilled water. It's summer, so no need for Anti freezing properties atm, I can get by with distilled water if I don't want to mix coolants.

BUT

g48 is a specific type of G11 coolant, but not all G11 are G48... so you can\`t swap between g48 and g11...

So, if you don't need to add too much, use distilled water for now, order the correct coolant, and then flush out some of the old coolant and add the new one, to the correct level. 

Don\`t play with this, because you can fuck up the engine big time! It\`s even more dangerous for the car than putting in the wrong oil. 

If the owner's manual says ""G48"", then that is what you put in.

Recently, I have had an issue with my car stalling (I hope that’s the right term.) My car will just turn off when not in motion. It happens when I start the car and idle for too long, or if I am stopped at a light, or when I switch from reverse to drive. I can turn my car off and back on and it works just fine. It is not consistent, and happens at least once a day. 
I took it in when it first started happening. My mechanic found that my exhaust needed replacing, he checked my fuel pump, and my brake line had rusted through which he repaired (that was scary to find out.) 
The stalling was still happening when I got it, so I brought it back in and he cleaned my throttle body. Unfortunately, it’s still happening. 
Does anyone have any idea what could be causing this? Is this car worth putting any more money into? I am a student, so getting a new car would be a serious investment, but at this point I am willing to do so.

Inevitable-Web2606 (Score: 1): Is your check engine light on?  That will provide some clues to what is wrong.

Stalling could be many different things, maybe more than one.  Something in the intake, old spark plugs, timing is a bit off, an air leak in the intake, etc.  Your best bet is to have a chat with your mechanic about the car's overall condition, and what it might need in the next year or two, or 10k to 20k miles.  Brakes, tires, suspension and steering parts might need to be replaced if they haven't been done ever (or in a while for the brakes).  It partly depends on the overall condition of the car's body, is it rusty or not.  It might be fine for a couple of years without any really big repairs, or it might be getting ready for some pretty big bills, in which case maybe selling it to someone who can fix it themselves is a good idea.  

Subaru's of this age are known for having head gasket leaks, those are expensive to repair.  It also has a timing belt that needs to be changed on schedule, which according to Google is every seven years or 105,000 miles, whichever comes first.  That's relatively expensive as well.

But if this car is paid for, and you just have basic insurance, payments on a new or newer car plus full coverage (the bank will want this) will be lots of money.  If you can buy something for cash, that's usually better financially in the long run."

I scraped most of it out and wiped away what I could and it looked like I got most of it but Im sure there are little bits left and I don't know what the inside of the oil pan looks like. I usually do an oil change in spring and fall. I now think I will do them more frequently since sludge is still building up. 

So now that I scraped the crap out, would it be better for me to use an engine wash additive or should I just do a bunch of oil changes in fairly short intervals like every 2000kms? I have heard that using oil that has detergent is the way to go to help reduce the sludge but how do you know which ones those are? Is it just the ones meant for high mile engine or is it a specific type of oil?

1m7t8c0,"Wheel Not Centered, Steering Wheel Natual Position Also Off Center","Hi, long story short I had a front end accident a while back, almost all of the damage was on the passenger side.

The shop replaced all of the following on the passenger side:
* Control arm (not sure if lower or upper)
* axel
* stab link
* ball joint
* core support

It was drivable again, I was just happy to get back on the road, but I noticed the front passenger wheel sits further back (towards the door), almost rubbing if it was 0.5in further back, and 2) the car pulls to the left if the steering wheel is straight.

For the past couple months I've been driving with my steering wheel pointed 5-10degrees to the right to keep straight. If I left go of the steering wheel, it's natural position it will return to is that 5-10 degree turn towards the right, so it's not like I'm applying constant pressure to maintain the ""turn"". 

Ive taken the car to 2 other shops, and gotten 2 alignments, made no difference.

One shop told me the subframe might be bent from the collision, the other shop said it might be a bent steering rack, but both shops had no concrete idea of what was actually wrong and would charge me $300+ for further diagnosis that may or may not lead anywhere.

Wanted to see if I had any luck here before going down that route.

* 2011 VW GTI
* Tires are pretty old but shops said they were fine, and 1 of them is starting to show some cupping, but I think this is a symptom rather than the cause

Car goes from the mid range, which is 202-217,  up to around 230 and cools down to around 220, then bounces back and forth between 230 and 220 until parked.

Will do this within 5-10 minutes of operating car from cold, with or without AC. Will also hold steady in the mid range for a while sometimes, then starts to overheat after a random amount of times.

Things I've noticed, the two lines on both sides of engine are wet around clamp. One I assume is from either water pump or AC line, but other is connected to bottom of Radiator.

Red/brown build up around battery, and it's a wet/mushy consistency. Smells like coolant, in my opinion.

Even if I let the car cool off overnight, then take the radiator cap off (I squeeze the upper large radiator tube to make sure there isn't a significant amount of pressure) there is a good bit of pressure still and will spit out coolant when opened.

1m7q3xs,pls help me understand this CVT(?) noise :/,"hi everyone,

I have a 2015 Subaru Forester 2.5 premium with 157,000 miles. About 4 months and 1500 miles ago my CVT valve body was replaced (classic solenoid issue). Ever since then, the car has a new noise: a fluttering / grinding sound under acceleration at low speeds, but only when the engine is cold. After 10-15 minutes of driving, the noise goes away. The noise goes up in pitch as I give it gas, but I can't hear it when rev'ing the engine while in park or neutral.

I have checked the two radiator fans, serpentine belt, tensioner and pulleys etc. and it's not coming from there. Driving the car feels fine, fuel economy is good.

Because I can only hear the noise while driving, it's hard to get a good recording, but this youtube video sounds extremely similar– so I'm worried it's transmission related.  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGMTx0Wcicg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGMTx0Wcicg)

my question is: should I be concerned about this? is a high mileage CVT allowed to make a bit of noise like that? what steps should I take to diagnose this further?  
there's no performance issues but it's annoying me and taking up mental space. I replaced head gaskets last year and with the valve body this year I'm hesitant to pour more money into this thing– at the same time, I would love for it to last another 50-100k miles.

any wisdom and constructive takes appreciated!

With finance you have a bit more chance of a discount but don't focus on the raw monthly payment and instead see what they can throw in as a bonus. Best thing to ask for is an increase in px value if you are trading your old car in, or a deposit contribution, though not many dealers offer these.

It helps if you can be a bit flexible on delivery date as there are often incentives for monthly or quarterly targets.

They are rebuildable with a seal kit but with the state of the outside I'd look to replace with new (if you can get it) or a good used one.

The rest of the stuff I see looks like suspension components which are heavier steel and will be OK for longer - you could wirebrush them and paint as a temporary repair, or look to replace if you care about keeping the car long term. 

The most important part of an old car is the body shell so it's worth treating any areas of rust you see on that because they will get worse and the shell is not as replaceable.

That style of hose clamp is best removed with a pair of parallel pliers or tongue and groove pliers, just squeeze the two tabs together as hard as you can and wiggle them, they do get pretty badly stuck to the rubber though so you might need to force it a bit. Or you could dremel through them.

An Insurer may ask you for a VIN number when processing your agreement, and the Dealer will also be able to provide this.

In relation to taxing the car, this is pretty normal for both examples. It's a complete pain in the arse for dealers to unravel the paperwork with the DVLA if you change your mind, so usually they will either tax on the day before or morning *of* your collection (I have also heard of places doing it when you turn up).

1m84oma,How to learn from scratch,"**Context:**

Hi everyone, I guess this is not going to be anything new on this sub but I am considering few options and would like to get opinion of more experienced people here.

I know nothing about cars, let us start there - all I know is from the hundreds of hours of content I watched on YouTube from carthrottle, TDC, ChrisFixIt etc. but I never properly worked on a car. And I would like to learn to do pretty much everything - to be able to fix a car, its components, and to be able (in time) to install mods and upgraded parts myself either on my driveway or in rented garage.

**Situation:**

I don't have a garage, just a driveway in front of my house that I can park anything on and work on it, I also have just some basic tools at home, no pneumatic guns and any other expensive fancy stuff.

Due to the fact that I have a mortgage I cannot really become an apprentice in a local garage (that crossed my mind) and would like to self learn.

**The conundrum:**

I went from considering a project car, to Nitro RC car, to mini petrol engine kits that you build yourself, to Petrol Go karts, to dirt bikes and kind of ended up in a analysis paralysis...

So my question is simple - what would be the most budget friendly way to start learning about petrol engines, how to fix them, how to work on any mechanical vehicle without the need to invest thousands of pounds for equipment?

I have a daily driver that is a lease so I cannot really do anything on it to learn (not even an oil change), so I am wondering what would be the best first step - apart from watching videos and reading books (both of which I consumed too much of).

Thank you for any advice, and for tolerating yet another post like this.

Think you just need to jump in and try something out.

Personally I did similar to u/Competitive_Pen7192 Just got an older car (also a Civic, but a 7th gen) and started with small jobs on that and built my way up. Sold a 2014 and bought a 2004. Something older and simpler to work on that's still useable daily. Something that has lots of parts available and lots of how-to videos on Youtube. But you can do it with most cars. Just buy tools you need for the next job. Doing something like a service or brake pad change will save you in garage costs about the same amount as the tools so it doesn't have to be a big investment. 

I started with an oil change. Then other servicing like air filters and spark plugs. Then brake pads and discs. Then suspension. Then a radiator. Then a bit of bodywork etc etc. Having a small driveway on a busy street in a rougher neighbourhood does limit what you can do, but I replaced the entire rear end (subframe, diff etc) on a 80s BMW there so a lot is doable.

I have an alternative though for dipping your toes in:

This summer I didn't have anything that needed doing on my car and not enough money to buy another. But wanted to fettle with something. So I bought a generator with a Honda engine and restored it. Could probably have sold for a profit, but have kept it for emergency use. Was much more cost effective than those mini petrol engine kits and more practical and sellable. Those Honda engines are used on loads of stuff so parts and guides are everywhere.

You could rebuild the whole thing or just start with a service. 

This sort of thing:

[https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/146714503114](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/146714503114)

An oil and spark plug change is basically like any engine:

[https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/176960167348](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/176960167348)

Some aftermarket stuff is a bit crap and you're better off rebuilding/refurbing proper Honda gear. But if you just want to get experience changing out the carburetor etc then parts are cheap:

[https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/236115131774](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/236115131774)

You can get every part from new exhausts to new fuel tanks. 

Get a wire brush, some rust converter, and black spray paint (and a hammer to bash it into shape) and just doing up the frame is similar to basic body repair. 

To keep costs down I think this will have basically everything you would need. Was my first and still most used socket set. Can turn it into an emergency set for the car if you invest in a proper set of 1/4, 3/8s and 1/2s.

You might also find you need a tool or two as you go. Maybe a spanner if you need to take it off the frame. Maybe an [impact screwdriver](https://www.halfords.com/tools/hand-tools/screwdrivers-and-hex-keys/halfords-advanced--impact-driver-and-bits-178172) as those exhaust screws look pretty rusty.

1m8422c,Calling all people who know about finance. Not sure what to do.,"My mum financed a Hyundai i30 towards the start of this year on a 5 yr agreement with Oodle Finance. In recent months it has been in and out of the garage for a couple issues they have yet to fix including the oil light randomly going on and off. Without going into too much detail about that, she has contacted the warranty company today to tell them the garage has advised they strip the engine for diagnostics which will cost around £1000. Now she is still awaiting for a breakdown of the costs of all repairs etc to give to the warranty company. But she is worried as she has already put previous repairs on credit cards as she doesn’t have the money to pay right away. I’d guess it depends what they say but what is the best way to go about this? Go ahead with the repairs and potentially be in a lot more debt or can she let go of the car? If she can how much would she probably owe to the finance company? It is under warranty with a company called Warranties2000.

SteveGribbin (Score: 6): I owned a car a few years ago which gave nothing but problems and was in and out of the garage over 10 times in the space of 8 months. The dealership didn't want to entertain the idea of rejecting the car (they were perfectly happy to continue fixing it, but at this point my confidence with the car was gone) so eventually the finance company terminated the agreement, bought it back from me and refunded my payments.

When did the issues first arise? This can be quite important. With my car issues started within a couple of weeks of buying it, but instead of rejecting it at that point I agreed with the garage to repair the car as I really liked it. Issues then occurred pretty much every month until it went back.

Eventually I made a written note of every issue the car had since purchase, including the dates they incurred, and wrote a letter which I took to the dealership advising I wanted to reject the car. When they refused, I contacted the finance company and explained the situation, detailed every issue I had and logged a grievance with them against the dealership. They asked for as much evidence as possible outlining any issues so I submitted all invoices from repairs which had been done, as well as photos and videos of the problems as they happened.

The finance company attempted to mediate with the dealership to come to an agreement, but the dealer still refused to accept rejection of the car. Ultimately after 3 months of back and forth the finance company advised they had agreed to terminate the agreement, take the car back themselves, refund my payments and pay £500 for inconvenience.

The finance company did stress that it was important to have made an effort with the dealership to reject the car myself before taking it up with them.

It was quite stressful, but it worked out in the end.

I am buying a non runner project car, it’s a Chrysler Crossfire with a 3.2l v6 engine. Now, it’s naturally aspirated so only about 220bhp.
The issue is, and I assume this has to do with engine size and my young age, but no temporary insurance company’s will quote me for this car. I’ve been driving for over 4 years, but I just can’t get anyone to give me a quote.

I’m the owner of a BMW E92 330d (M57, 2006).
Mileage is 233,000.

I’m thinking about what to do next.
I bought the car at 112,000 miles. No issues since then — I’ve just been regularly replacing the oil every 8–10 thousand miles.

Recently, my coolant started leaking. I took it to a garage, and they replaced the water pump, thermostat, belt, and pulleys. Everything was fine for about 1,000 miles, but now it’s leaking again — from the water pump.

The engine is generally in good condition. There are some minor leaks around the manifold, and the timing chain has never been replaced — it’s still original.

Now I’m wondering what to do:
Should I do a full engine service — replace the chain, fix the oil leaks, and sort out anything else that needs attention — or just buy a newer version?
I’m a bit hesitant to go for the N57, because it’s not as bulletproof as the M57.

What’s the condition of the underside?  Being a 2006 and on 233k miles, your rear subframe is probably pretty corroded now and they’re expensive to replace.  E92 rear subframes are quite strong, but age will get to it eventually unless it’s treated and protected before the rust becomes structural.
