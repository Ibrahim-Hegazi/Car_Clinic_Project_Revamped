1ojkpyh,Subaru Forester 2015 horror story,"Hi all,

I'll try to keep this succinct:

I have a Subaru Forester XT Turbo 2015 with 88000 miles on it.  Check engine light came on, mechanic says misfire and needs valve head job.   Spend nearly 4k and now needs another 7-8k in repairs.  Car is worth 10k.

Get car back, has acceleration issues, mechanic plays it a few times and it's not quite right. Take it to dealer, they do a valve cleaning of some kind and reprogram the timing, and now it accelerates properly.  Week later, check engine comes back, I take it to dealer and they use a camera in the cylinders and say there is gunk buildup and it needs walnut blasting.   They do it for free which was nice.   Car drives fine for two weeks, then suddenly car engine fails with oil all over while going uphill on the freeway.   Tow to dealer with following diagnosis:

UPON ARRIVAL FOUND THE OIL LEVEL AT 1/4 FULL AND THE OIL IS
CLEAN, AMBER DIPSTICK CAME OUT OF THE TUBE DUE TO EXCESSIVE
CRANKCASE PRESSURE. THIS IS DUE TO TO PISTON FAILURE ON
CYLINDER 4. CODES P0304- PERMANENT, P0302 AND P0300 PENDING.
ENGINE HAS HAD PREVIOUS CYLINDER HEAD WORK DONE. NO HISTORY
OF THIS WORK BEING DONE HERE OR ON THE SUBARU INQUIRY . #4
SPARK PLUG BROKE. NO COMPRESSION IN CYLINDER 4, LEAKDOWN
100%. THE OTHER CYLINDER COMPRESSIONS ARE AT 230 PSI
LEAKDOWN 20%. SUSPECT RINGLAND FAILURE ON # 4 PISTON. REC
ENGINE TEAR DOWN TO INSPECT INTERNAL DAMAGE

Anyway, took it back to original mechanic and he says it needs a used engine which will be 7k.  I am reluctant because it isn't worth much more than 10k, and I got an online offer to scrap it for 2k.   

Should I keep looking for alternate buyers to buy as-is, pursue a repair?   Any chance of me getting compensation from the original shop? 

Sorry, some of my terminology is not quite right,  but I appreciate any advice. ",1,1761781993.0,2,MechanicAdvice,1761852997,2025-10-29 23:53:13,2025-10-30 19:36:37,"QwopperFlopper (Score: 2): This is the story of every turbo Subaru at some point. I have no idea why people keep buying these cars.

1ojkkca,Acceleration steadily getting worse…help!,"I’ll try to be concise. I have a 2013 Mazda cx5. I bought it new almost 16 years ago. No issues until 3 years ago I hauled a small U-Haul (not very heavy) trailer from Maryland to Southern California. Along the way I first noted that my foot was all the way down and I was not accelerating. This persisted without the trailer. Several mechanics have sent me away with nothing to go on. It’s slowly getting worse to the point that from a stop sign I floor it and nothing happens for 1-2 seconds and then it revs up like crazy and barely gets going. Manual mode is the only way I can get up hills as it seems to not want to downshift automatically but even then it struggles in fourth gear, third it goes red, fifth I can floor it and just go slower and slower. I drive through steep hills daily to and from work. Again, every mechanic has said it’s not fuel pump/ filter, not transmission, not mass air sensor, I did spark plugs myself no change. My intuition is telling me that it’s a combination of things but I’m hoping ya’ll can help me narrow it down so I can not spend $10K all at once. I am not a mechanic but an commercial electrician so I know tools and hope to be able to do the work myself if possible. I’m open to any and all ideas and thank you all in advance.

1ojk0fm,2013 Toyota Corolla - Deteriorating Fuel Economy / Slight idle juddering..,"I have a 2013 Toyota Corolla that seems to now get less than stellar fuel economy. After a reset of the average L/100 I seem to getting between 9.1 - 9.4 (L/100) when tested across two separate 1 month periods. I thought that maybe it was just it calculating it weird and did a range test with 3 full tank fill-ups and I usually get between 425km and 455km on a tank driving mostly the same terrain each fill-up. From what I understand with a good mix of highway and city that should be closer to 8.4 L/100 and maybe even better. I also get a rough idle more than occasionally but no CEL is thrown.  
  
Things tried  
=========  
The car has about 223,000k on it now and so far I've replaced a cracked exhaust manifold a few months back, I've replaced my air filter which was horribly clogged with a new OE compatible one. I've also put in some NGK 93501 spark plugs as well in the past few months. Lastly I removed the MAF around the same time and used the proper cleaner (half a can) and it didn't seem to make a difference.  
  
I work at at a small used car lot and have access to a ODB scan tool (Autel MX808). I've gone in and read some of the O2 related parameters. I thought at first it was maybe catalytic converter related but I'm not convinced now (the temps at upstream / downstream seem about right). The one thing that does seem quite off from a lot of videos I watched was the Short / Long fuel trims. The short at idle seems to be around 10% most of the time (compared to a another 2018 Corolla on the lot that was reading around 0-1%). In the Youtube embedded video I also rev up to around 2500 rpm and it seems to go about -1.5% on the STFT and +12% on the LTFT.  
  
I am thinking of doing a vacuum test tomorrow to see if there is anything obvious showing up there. Also maybe spray some carb cleaner around the intake to see what gives.  
  
I've attached a video of it at idle after 20 minute warmup and half way through video while revving to 2500rpm.

1ojj24w,Car battery gone bad twice now,"Hi guys,

Have an old 2010 Mazda 3.

Twice now in 6 months I've had two batteries go bad on me with the same symptoms. First battery was under a year old and second one is 5-6 months old. Both Kirkland signature ones from Costco.

Same issue twice, this time after coming back from vacation for 3.5 weeks. Battery dead, won't hold a charge and if I boost it the car will keep dying, power off and on quickly, have no power steering, etc... and just repeatedly die. If I swap for another battery from my other car no issues at all so it's definitely the battery.

I've tried to recondition both with no luck and luckily Costco just replaces it but I don't want this to happen again.

Any idea what's causing this ? Is it parasitic draw from being idle too long ? We don't use this car too often as as mentioned was about 4 weeks on vacation this time around.

It's not the need to boost it, this is a non issue, it's the fact that I'm somehow bricking batteries.

Since the start of the year more or less, I feel how I lose my turbocharger while on the highway, making me lose a lot of HP, which affects me being able to overtake safely, and also penalizes me a lot on inclines.

This is something random and not too frequent (it happened 3-5 times so far), and the problem is gone the next time I get the car.

I have an old ODBII reader (those Chinese blue ones with Bluetooth), and I was able to read a P0299 error code in the history (turbocharger under boost) that makes sense with what I have experienced.

If you have an F40 like I think (the problem is very common) there are workshops that can repair the instrument cluster for you. Bear in mind you will need to remove the cluster (not difficult) and ship it to them. Expect to pay £200-250 for the repair, there's far more involved than two needles. [Here](https://totaltronics.com/instrument-cluster-repairs/bmw/bmw-1-series-f40-instrument-cluster-repair/) is an example, if you are not far you can book an appintment and they will repair your cluster while you wait.

Looking for some advice. My 2018 Hyundai Elantra recently started driving really rough and threw a code for a cylinder 3 misfire. (VIN KMHD04LB7JU511149) I took it to a local mechanic, and after doing a compression test, they told me there’s a leak in that cylinder.

The shop said it would be more cost-effective to replace the engine rather than trying to fix the leak due to the labor involved in figuring out what exactly needs to be fixed. I’m trying to figure out if the car’s a lost cause or if repairing it might still make sense.

The car has 120,000 miles, and otherwise it’s been in decent shape. Has anyone dealt with something similar? Is an engine swap the best route, or could this be repaired for less? Should I just sell it and move on? 

Thanks so much for any advice!

RudbeckiaIS (Score: 1): Ferrari and Maserati dealerships charge 2 hours per wheel for brake replacement. I don't think they charge less than $300/hour, likely closer to $400/hour these days. It's a standard charge for the job, you cannot escape it. 

The Levante came with two brake options and I bet this is the one with the sport brake package: those brakes are really expensive, and part price more than doubled in price in the last 3 years. 

In short nothing abnormal for these cars and the reason nobody wants a used Maserati: I remember it was already this way with the 90s Biturbo/Ghibli. Even basic maintenance/wear item replacement was prohibitively expensive for a car nobody wanted to buy used.

Bear in mind these high end Brembo love to squeak, and the best way to get them to squeak is to use cheap components, whether rotors or pads. Maserati owners expect not having to return to the dealership/garage because their brand new brakes squeak continously."

The calipers themselves are extremely rusty but I read online that that doesn't make a difference. Anything helps, thanks!

Not working:
	•	Windows
	•	Blinkers
	•	Sunroof
	•	Headlights
	•	Interior lights

Working:
	•	Small side marker lights near the headlights
	•	The car starts and runs normally under regular conditions

Special note:
	•	After disconnecting and reconnecting the battery, the car beeps loudly and dies immediately.

Here’s what I’ve already checked or done:
	•	All fuses in both fuse boxes are fine
	•	Battery terminals are clean, and the battery itself is charged
	•	Door wires have been checked
	•	Some of the grounds going to the main fuse box were corroded, which I’m cleaning but don’t have a lot of tools so I’m waiting on some from work. 

I suspect the issue might be with the BCM (Body Control Module) or a related connector/circuit.

Has anyone experienced something like this on a Jetta? Could missing or corroded grounds at the fuse box cause all these issues? Any tips for diagnosing BCM problems or where to check next would be greatly appreciated. Also I should add I don’t really know anything about electrical lol I have my repair manual and chat GPT that has been getting me through all my work lol

At first I thought that expansion tank was cracked but after inspecting I saw nothing was cracked, broken or damaged in any way. Only transmission cooler was popped off from radiator so l replaced O rings, assembled everything back to together, bled the system and everything was fine. Couple months after, I started to get coolant light that was coming on and off and then suddenly I felt strong coolant smell and it was leaking again. Same thing, nothing is damaged, broken or cracked. This time expansion tank was popped from the radiator mount. Before both of this issues happened I had similar coolant issues, always something was popping off the mounts/connectors, nothing ever cracked of broke.
Now this time I decided it to replace every single part of cooling system. Even the pipes under intake manifold. I spent so much time and money and after I was finally done, bled the system, and again, my coolant light kept coming on and off. and after couple days guess what? Hose that connects to the coolant distributor pipe under expansion tank popped off. Still no cracks or broken parts. When everything is working fine and some random parts are not coming off the mounts or connectors my coolant never leaks. This already happened around 5-6 times. What could be the reason? Why are my parts randomly coming off from connections?

I had to replace the engine, and in doing so one of the wires that I described broke - I had to replace it, it’s the one that was standalone and didn’t merge into the ring terminals. The fusible link was colored green, if that helps. I have all 3 mounted onto the starter stud, but I don’t know where the other end of the wire I replaced goes. It can’t be ground, since connecting the positive to a ground would create a dead short. Here are some photos of the wire (it’s red, but it’s just dirty) And the first photo used to have a green fusible link with a ring terminal that went to the starter, but it broke. It’s the other end with the small hole that I can’t figure out.

The whole car has electrical power, but leaving the one wire disconnected means the car does nothing when I turn the key to the “start” position. So it must have something to do with the crank electrical system. Please help!"

1ojb77e,defective PCV valve on Audi EA888 2.0 TFSI?,"Hey guys, about a month ago i bought a 2009 Audi A4 B8 2.0 TFSI with 190k km/ 120k miles and noticed really quickly that it has high oil consumption which seems to be typical for this car relating to and issue with the piston rings, I have bought an engine flush and a spray to clean the piston rings, which i didn't use yet. I have also checked if the PCV valve is okay by opening the Oil Cap while the car is running and it created a vacuum and the RPM etc didn't change at all.. 

So I assume it's broken, but while checking the production date on it, I have noticed that it has a Production date of 11/2022 (original Audi part), and according to the Inspection date the car had around 165k km at the time this PCV valve was produced. 

So my question is, what is the chance of it actually being broken again after around 30k km or 20k miles? Or what else could it be?

The carborator is calibrated (from the factory) to use E0 gasoline. I live in MN where E0 is available but expensive. So i generally run on E10.

It runs good-great on e0
it runs ok-good on e10, i do lose some power but not enough to be notable or a problem.

So the issue at hand is since this is my commuter, i want to be able to fill up on gas wherever. Top tier e10 is what i run it on right now, but SOME gas stations only have e15.

E15 is a bit too lean for it to run well.

Could i rejet the carb, go up a size or 2, to have it run great on e10, and ok-good on e15-e30?

It would be nice to have the greater flexability and also possibly use (slightly) cheaper fuel.

To get ahead of the people that will say ""corrosion"" or ""gaskets, seals, and hoses"", the entire fuel system has been upgraded to be ethanol resistant already (Ptfe and ethanol resistant hoses, aluminum fuel lines, ethanol resistant carb parts, electric fuel pump rated to run pure ethanol, and a plastic fuel tank). Also it gets driven ~700 miles per week, the fuel will not be in there long enough to go stale or absorb water.

If not that it could be your heat shield rattling..Have you had your brakes changed recently?

Ive also written it the wrong way round you wanna check if it’s your heat shield first and then once that’s eliminated then you can start thinking about the cv joint 

Just go around your car and give the heat shield a little shake, it’s the thin piece of metal behind your disk brakes, no need to take your wheels off, if it has movement in it then happy days it’s a cheap fix

1oit2c8,Water pump bolts snapped,"**Background:** My daughter bought a 2013 Chevy Sonic from a used car dealer a little more than a month ago. Drove fine and the check engine light came on, and was making a knocking noise when accelerating when stopped - doesn't do it while accelerating while moving.

**Issue:** Car is in the shop (mechanic I trust - great shop) and they told me that they discovered the water pump bolts were snapped and had ultra grey all over it. They looked at the bolts and said they were galled and it would be difficult/risky to try to take them out because on that model Chevy the bolts are at the edges of the block, and trying to remove the bolts and rethread the holes couldn't be done because there wasn't enough ""meat"" at the edges where the bolts are. 

Called the dealer and they said it was a trade-in they got a few weeks before we bought it, and they would contact the previous owner about the water pump. Dealer called back and said the previous owner did have the water pump replaced but wouldn't give the name of the mechanic or shop name (pretty sus). Work was done in 2023. It was covered in ultra grey, so the previous mechanic that f'd it up knew that and just put a band-aid on the issue. Driving it over time obviously was not kind to those bolts.

Mechanic said the best way is to drop another engine in it - best cost was $4500 for engine/labor. My daughter only paid $2500 for the car, so replacing an engine for that cost does't make much sense, and again, I trust this mechanic. He said to take some time to think it over, and when I call tomorrow, he'll most likely agree that replacing the engine wouldn't be feasible, as the work to do it will almost be double the cost of what she paid for the car. 

**Question for the group:** Is it possible that there could be a way to fix it by way of removing the bolts somehow without compromising the engine block? I believe my mechanic, and they do good work, so I'm thinking they're worried about any liability trying to get the bolts out, but I'm wondering if anyone here has experienced the same circumstances and was able to fix the issue, rather than replace the whole engine?

So, currently my tread depths are as follows: FR = 6/32, FL = 5.5/32, BR = 4.5/32, BL= 4/32.

1oiw83e,is PPF Worth it on a new car?,"Paint Protection Film (PPF) is a product that can definitely be considered a good investment for a new car. It works as clear barrier which protects the paint from various damages such as rock chips, scratches, bird droppings and also UV fading. This whole process keeps the car looking newer for a longer time and possibly increases the car's resale value as well. The installation of Paint Protection Film can seem like an expensive affair but in most cases, it is a wise decision in the long run as it significantly lowers the necessity of paint repairs or touch-ups. If you have luxury vehicles, a new car going through a daily commute that involves tough weather, or just want to keep up with the maintenance of an impeccable paint job, the installation would be a great investment.",0,1761715370.0,2,carquestions,1761852997,2025-10-29 05:22:50,2025-10-30 19:36:37,"Unique_Mix9060 (Score: 1): It depends on the car, if it’s a normal traffic car, like Corrolla Camry, even mid teir cars like E class and 5 Series, I’d say is not worth it.

1oj9sgt,2011 Lexus RX350 battery issues,"My 2011 Lexus RX350 has had persistent battery issues. I’m wondering if there is anything else we can do to stop the problems? Or do I need to just continue replacing the battery until the car fully dies? More info below. 

 I’ve been driving this car since 2016, it was my mom’s before that. Since about 2016/17, I’ve had to replace the battery every year once it gets cold. The battery will die, and always ends up needing replaced. One year, the shop that replaced the battery had only hand tightened the battery, which we discovered because sometimes the battery would briefly disconnect while I was driving and the car would turn off then back on while on the road!

We had some of the connections to the battery replaced a couple years ago, as they looked eroded, and so I didn’t have to replace the battery last year in the winter. 

Another thing to note, my parents had Best Buy install a remote start into the car in maybe 2014? I’ve always wondered if that is somehow involved in draining the battery, but I’m unsure. I wouldn’t even know how to go about removing it. 

Well, my battery died today at the gas station. I had driven to the gas station next to my house, and my car wouldn’t turn back on once I finished fueling up. My husband came and jumped my car so I could drive it back home. He took a look and said that the connections still look good.

Gunner_862 (Score: 1): Hi,

A couple of suggestions:

I agree with getting your alternator output tested to ensure it's putting out enough voltage to keep the battery charged and electrical systems on the vehicle running.

For vehicles that get used infrequently, sometimes a battery tender (trickle charger) can help keep the battery up between uses, but only if there is no parasitic draw on the battery.

Get a parasitic draw test performed. This will help locate and eliminate whatever may be draining the battery when the car is not in use. Here is a link to explain the process: [https://www.wikihow.com/Find-a-Parasitic-Battery-Drain](https://www.wikihow.com/Find-a-Parasitic-Battery-Drain) <-can be used to see if remote starter is the culprit

Finally, it's important to ensure that all electrical connections at the battery, starter, alternator and body grounds are clean, tight and free of corrosion. Hope this helps!

1oixugy,Road salt destroys cars faster than people realize,"Winter is coming and road salt is about to wreck a lot of cars. Here's what happens and how to prevent it.

Salt accelerates rust like crazy. It holds moisture against metal and speeds up corrosion. The underside gets coated in salt spray and rust starts within months. Rocker panels, wheel wells, frame rails, and suspension components get hit hardest.

Most people don't think about it until rust holes appear years later. By then the damage is extensive and expensive to fix. Prevention is way cheaper than repair.

Wash the underside regularly during winter. Not just the body but specifically the undercarriage. Many car washes have undercarriage spray. Do this every couple weeks when roads are salted. Gets the salt off before it eats metal.

Door sills and rocker panels trap salt and water. Clean these areas out. Pull back weather stripping if possible and clean underneath. Salt accumulates in hidden spots and just sits there corroding.

Paint chips and scratches are entry points for rust. Salt gets into any bare metal and starts working. Touch up chips before winter. Even if it's not perfect, it's better than exposed metal with salt on it.

Use rubber floor mats in winter, not carpet. Carpet mats soak up salt water from boots and hold it against the floor pan causing rust from inside. Rubber mats can be rinsed off.

Wheel wells are vulnerable. Salt builds up thick and traps moisture. Spray them out with a hose regularly.

Brake lines and fuel lines run along the underside and get salt exposure. Rust on brake lines can cause them to leak or burst. Inspect during oil changes or tire rotations.

Being proactive about salt damage saves thousands long term. Regular washing and inspection catches issues before they become major problems. If buying a used car from a salt state, check hard for rust in wheel wells, under door sills, and along frame rails.",540,1761721749.0,97,autorepair,1761852997,2025-10-29 07:09:09,2025-10-30 19:36:37,"zrad603 (Score: 43): annual ""oil undercoating"" is way more effective at stopping rust than trying to wash it out.

1oj2bn3,Belt squeal and metal clanking after timing cover repair,"Hi everyone, I really need some serious help figuring this out. The vehicle is a 2001 Chevy Express 1500. 

About a year ago, I had some warranty work done on my van to replace a leaking oil pan gasket and timing cover gasket. The mechanic had to remove practically everything in front of the motor to get to it. Right after that repair, the belt started squealing like crazy. We ended up replacing the idler tension pulley and the power steering pump, but the noise kept coming back. The only thing that finally stopped it was replacing the serpentine belt — weirdly, it took two brand-new belts, but the second one finally made the squeal disappear.

Fast-forward a year later, I took the van in for an oil change, and they pointed out that both the timing cover gasket and oil pan were leaking again. Since the repair was still under warranty, I took it back to the same mechanic. He redid the job a few days ago, but now the problem is back — only worse.

This time, the belt still squeals, but now there’s also a metal clanking noise that comes and goes. While driving, if I turn left or right, the squeal gets louder until it suddenly stops, and that’s when the metal clanking takes over. The two sounds go back and forth, never happening at the same time. It quiets down when I’m pressing on the gas but always comes back when I slow down or come to a stop.

We’ve already replaced the harmonic balancer, the AC compressor, and the serpentine belt again. After installing the new AC compressor, it ran perfectly for about five minutes before the squealing started to creep back in — and then the metal clanking followed shortly after.

1oir0p7,2009 Mini Cooper,"Hey guys! I bought a 2009 Mini Cooper convertible (base model) a year and a half ago and I’ve had nothing but problems since. Now I can’t get it to pass smog and I’m looking for advice. I think the most prominent problem I’ve been having is excessive oil consumption. I’ve never noticed an oil leak (not sure if oil leaks are always obvious though..?) and since I’ve had it I’m constantly adding oil. It’s been parked in my garage since July when it was in an accident, but up until that point, I had to add at least a quart of oil a week. That’s totally not normal right?!? Is that a sign that more serious engine problems are present? What are some causes for burning excessive oil?? Everytime I accelerated - I was followed by a black cloud of smoke from the exhaust. So embarrassing!!! I was determined to figure it out until I was rear ended in July. The car still ran after that, I just stopped driving it because the registration was (and still is expired). Paid my fees at the DMV for them to tell me the car is due for a smog check. Well, the check engine light has been on for about 6 months, so basically I just am asking for assistance to get the car to pass smog so I can sell it. I scanned the engine myself and then took it to a mechanic just to cross check the code. The code it showed was P2414 and P2195 - Both related to the O2 sensor. How do I know which O2 sensor needs to be replaced? Is it a job I can do by myself? I am done putting money into it but obviously I’m going to have to, to sell it. I am not a mechanic by any means but since having this car I’ve learned a lot from all its problems. My mechanic skills basically end at changing the oil - which is something I taught myself how to do (with a qualified friend mechanic standing near by, haha). 

Anyways I’m sick of car problems and everything I read on line tells me something different. I’m more confused than ever and I’m feeling so discouraged. This is my last step before I sell/donate the car to Pick Your Part for a whopping $412, and considering I paid $7600 for the car, I’d rather not do that!

I have always serviced it on time at home. It has only been to the dealer for recalls and the occasional check engine light, which has always been covered by TSBs or recalls (power relay replacement and KSDS update).

Lately, I've been hearing knocking during driving, which is to be expected I guess. It does have a Nu with the extended lifetime warranty per the settlement. I've had 2 occasions where it will go to limp mode and P1326 is stored, along with a bunch of other codes. 1st time to the dealer, it got a new knock sensor. 2nd time, the dealer said EGR pipe and valve failure and recommended replacement. I've read the recall/TSB and I'm guessing it didn't fail the BCT. But I really feel I should be getting a new engine.

Also, I've been losing coolant. I don't burn any oil, I don't have white smoke, nor do I have overheating. I don't have milkshake in the oil, radiator, or overflow. I'm just pushing coolant into the overflow and losing it on the ground at a substantial rate (the under engine cover is wet after a drive). I've replaced the radiator cap with new OEM.

Pictures attached are of the valvetrain through the oil fill. Then piston 1-4 and cylinder walls 2-3 (I didn't feel like rotating the engine to get 1 and 4 on the bottom, just wanted to check for steam cleaning of the piston head).

1ojjbfc,Altezza RS200 — high RPM at highway speeds? Final drive or speedometer issue?,"Hey guys,  
I’ve got a **2000 Toyota Altezza RS200 (BEAMS 3S-GE, 6-speed J160 trans)** and I’m trying to figure out why my gearing feels super short.

Here’s what I’ve noticed:

* In **6th gear**, I’m doing around **4200 RPM at 100 km/h**.
* But my **speedometer is off** — when my dash says \~76–80 km/h, my actual speed (checked by GPS) is **100 km/h**

Here are the **gear ratios** for a completely stock rs200. reference:

    1st — 3.874
    2nd — 2.175
    3rd — 1.484
    4th — 1.223
    5th — 1.000
    6th — 0.869
    Final drive (stock): 4.300
    Tire size: 215/45R17
    

So I’m wondering:

* Could my **final drive** have been swapped for something shorter because its acting like a 5.8 which is insane (like a 4.77 or 4.9 like the AE86)?
* Would that explain both the higher RPM *and* the speedo being off?
* Are there any common **diff swaps** people do on Altezzas that would cause this (IS300, JZX, etc.)?

I’m planning to service the diff soon with Red Line 75W90 and want to check if it’s the original unit before that and if its safe to do that.

Any insight would be awesome, just trying to understand if this is normal gearing or if someone changed something before I bought it.

Sep 4: Car passes emissions test and is allowed to be sold in GA (and then my daughter shows up and buys it!)

Good afternoon, everyone. I have a bit of an odd situation that I’m dealing with. 

For the past few months (and dated as far back as a year before), I’ll get a check engine light on my dashboard, and every time I take it to autozone, the codes are P0420 (and potentially P0430 but it’s 100% P0420 at least once). 

So, the issue is that, the light sort of comes off and on, and I usually wasn’t able to determine what makes it come on. Occasionally, I’d buy a bottle of Cataclean or some other additive meant for the codes, and it would go away. 

I noticed recently, however, that more often than not the light would come on after I get within a specific range of fuel. Now, I haven’t taken it to autozone recently, which I may as well do tomorrow, but literally each time I take it in the code reads the same. After I fill up my gas tank, the light takes maybe 1-2 trips to somewhere like my school and then goes away. This light came on like, years ago, and I noticed that it seemed to come on primarily in the colder months, but now it’s seeming to come on mainly with low fuel. I HAVE read into some reddits about this, where people have similar issues, but my car doesn’t seem to be misfiring, or giving any like, NOTICEABLE issues. It doesn’t even say on the dash “check engine” like it tends to do with more severe things that need to be checked 

My question is, what in the world could it possibly be? Again, haven’t taken it into autozone most recently, but even then, it’s most likely still popping up with the same codes.

So I have 2002 BMW 325Ci. Few months ago my car dumped the whole coolant while I was driving. At first I thought that expansion tank was cracked but after inspecting I saw nothing was cracked, broken or damaged in any way. Only transmission cooler was popped off from radiator so l replaced O rings, assembled everything back to together, bled the system and everything was fine. Couple months after, I started to get coolant light that was coming on and off and then suddenly I felt strong coolant smell and it was leaking again. Same thing, nothing is damaged, broken or cracked. This time expansion tank was popped from the radiator mount. Before both of this issues happened I had similar coolant issues, always something was popping off the mounts/connectors, nothing ever cracked of broke.
Now this time I decided it to replace every single part of cooling system. Even the pipes under intake manifold. I spent so much time and money and after I was finally done, bled the system, and again, my coolant light kept coming on and off. and after couple days guess what? Hose that connects to the coolant distributor pipe under expansion tank popped off. Still no cracks or broken parts. When everything is working fine and some random parts are not coming off the mounts or connectors my coolant never leaks. This already happened around 5-6 times. What could be the reason? Why are my parts randomly coming off from connections?

2. Find a shop thats willing to take a gamble on you and teach you everything from the ground up. It will take a little longer and youll really have to apply yourself but eventually youll make it to the top. Local tire shops or a mom and pop shop would be a good start. 


In my experience I did option 2. Started as a lube tech at my local dodge dealership with absolutely 0 experience and knowledge in anything related to blue collar jobs. Applied myself there and learned the basics. From there I switched to BMW and learned more in depth repairs and diagnosing. Most if not all brands/dealerships will send you to their own private schools to teach you about their specific vehicles as well as being able to diagnose electric problems and other things. 


At the end of the day it all comes down to you and how much you apply yourself as well as your work ethic. If im correct i believe diesel technicians make more money than regular gas techs. Diesel techs are always in demand. Understand in this field things dont always go smoothly. Things get rusty and break, parts fail and some jobs can be a pain in the arse but again its down to you and how you apply yourself. You can make very good money long term.

You can do that while you go to school for it, which I also recommend.

I will say… you gotta understand that doing it professionally is a completely different vibe than doing it in your own stuff or with buddies. It’s serious, hard work. Doing it wrong or improperly can really, really hurt people. You’ll hate your life some days.

BUT right now there’s a real shortage of auto techs. If you get in, learn your stuff, get good and be a skilled, experienced, reliable technician, you’ll almost be able to pick your employer, name your price, be unfireable, and make bank.

So it’s a real double edged sword. It’s a hard life, with really frustrating circumstances sometimes with a LOT of responsibility in an industry where the people you’re trying to help often don’t trust you because there’s a reputation out there from scumbags…

However, as I look and research more into the issue, I don’t want to do a pad slap as it seems to be the wrong thing to do and it’ll wear down my rotors eventually. My sister advised me to just replace pads. 

Im a broke college student, so I’m thinking of just taking it to a shop for free assessment, then replacing the pads and rotors on just my front wheels.

Replaced all spark plugs, coils, fuel injectors, and some sensors. Same issue still happening. Took it to the dealer and they told us the following: 
“We performed a cylinder compression test and found cylinder #5 has low compression, reading between 125-150 psi, while all other cylinders are around 200 psi. We then did a leak-down test on that cylinder, and it showed about 50% leakage - normal would be around 5-10%.

While performing the test, we noticed the spark plugs show signs of burning coolant. We also inspected the cooling system and found the coolant looks and smells burnt, which suggests exhaust gases are entering the cooling system. Additionally, there's an abnormal knocking noise coming from the lower end of the engine, which could indicate a connecting rod issue.

Given the combination of low compression, coolant contamination, internal engine noise, and the vehicle's mileage, we strongly recommend replacing the engine rather than attempting further repairs. This would be the most reliable long-term solution.”

Couple months later, the same thing popped up while driving home. I was a couple minutes from home so I figured id drive home, but when I was about to pull in, I got a warning sign about ""Engine overheated - Idel immediately"". I took it to my mechanic and he replaced the Thermostat House, put coolant in and the issue was fixed. 

The other day, I noticed my thermostat inside my car saying the engine was getting hot. I put coolant in and figured its fine. I got the ""engine overheating- idel immediately"" message again. I waited, put coolant and drove it home. I opened my hood when I got home and noticed bubbling (possibly boiling) in the coolant tank and a leak at the bottom of the overflow hose. I replaced the hose and the cap. I drove it around the block and noticed the thermostat starting to go up and that my engine has a bit of shaking (I let the car run in my driveway 5 minutes before driving around the block). 

I'm asking for some help in what you guys think I should do. I know the obvious awnser is to get another car (I imagine) and that is my goal, but I have to drive this car for the time being. I'm trying to see if these are maybe an easy issue to fix, or should I be worried to drive at all.

However, a power steering fault message flashed up and the steering wheel became extremely heavy to the point I was barely able to pull out of the spot I was in. I restarted the car to try and get rid of the fault, but it had no effect. The steering felt normal at speed as expected but at the next few lights, it was still very heavy when stopped. After driving for a bit it started getting progressively better, as I was turning the wheel left and right when stopped to try and get a feel for it. Eventually it felt normal and when I reached home after 5-6 minutes of driving, I cleared any errors using my OBD scanner and restarted the car. The error was gone and it stayed that way after I went for a 15 minute drive to check if everything felt like normal, which it did.

This morning though, I tried setting off for work, but the car wouldn't start. Instead it would just click as seen in the video, leading me to think that battery is dead.

I would really appreciate it if anyone could point me to what to check and what my next steps should be.

First, before touching relays or grounds, grab a multimeter and check your battery voltage. Start the car and it should be 13.5-14.5V. If it's dropping below 12V when cranking, your battery might be on its way out despite seeming fine otherwise - weak batteries cause intermittent no-starts and can mess with CAN communication.

The ""Not Ready"" status combined with the ECU communication errors is key. This points to either power delivery to the ECU or CAN bus issues. When the car won't start and the lights come on, check:

\- Is the starter trying to turn? (You should hear clicking)

\- Or is it completely dead with no sound?

This tells you if the problem is the ECU not starting the starter vs. the ECU not getting power at all.

Your ground points on the B6: one main one is under the battery tray, another is on the shock tower near the passenger side strut. These corrode easily from salt exposure. While you're there, check the ECU power connector - moisture is way more common than actual relay failure on these cars.

One thing ChatGPT and Claude might have missed: that P0693/P0695 cooling fan code combo with the ECU communication error could also mean a failing fan module pulling too much current and browning out the ECU power supply. Not just a fan circuit issue.

Keep a log of what triggers it if possible - cold start, after driving, sitting overnight, etc. Intermittent faults are usually power-delivery related, and patterns help narrow it down fast.

Good luck with it!"
1oixrez,Tachometer needle doesn't move - possibly to repair?,"Hi, new to group. As said in the headline my tachometer needle doesn't move. It's of course quite manageable to drive it on gear/rpm, but all in it would be nice to have a functional tachometer. Appreciate any informed advice.

Changed my gauge faces recently and obviously something went wrong when I detached and/or reattached the tachometer needle again.

First time after reassembly the needle was a little bit off and stopped at 40. Took it apart and both removed, reattached and recalibrated the needle. On the way back to the car the needle then sort of hanged loose and moved freely between 0 and 40 when I carried the instrument cluster horizontally. Reinstalled in its vertical position, it stayed at 0.

Did it once more and tried to feel if something felt broken when I recalibrated the needle again (it's done moving it counterclockwise back to the preferred starting point at 0) but it ""clicked"" in the same way as the other needles.

So two questions; Is it possible to give some kind of educated guess on what's causing this and if it is likely to be reparable or more cost effective to source a second hand instrument cluster? They seem to cost between 50 to 200 euros plus reprogramming.

It concerns an Alfa Romeo Mito, but it is  exactly the same instrument cluster is found in Fiat/Abarth Grande Punto and also Opel Corsa D & E was built on the same platform as these models were developed during the GM-Fiat years.

Your abs sensors are bolted into the knuckles and they either read your axles or your bearings.

Unless you cut off some earlier video where the burglar makes the lights flash when the fob is used to unlock it. But I assume not.

Alternatively, that door lock is faulty. When you press the lock button on the fob, it should do the light flash thing if it detects all doors are locked. If it doesn't flash, it still locks all the doors it can, but lack of a flash means one or more locks didn't lock. Maybe check your CCTV from earlier to see if when you locked it, you got da flash.

Unlock always flashes so pressing the unlock button and getting a flash means nothing.

If you get no flash when locking  (due to a faulty lock) the alarm doesn't activate.

If the alarm was active, aside from the fact the interior light turns on (so the car obviously knows the door opened) then the motion sensors would trip it.

So I'm fair sure the alarm wasn't activated, and the door didn't lock, because you have a faulty door lock or you just forgot to lock it.

1ojitwg,Urgent Advice Needed Purchased a new vehicle.,"Hi, thanks in advance. So. 

I have a car which I purchased of a family friend. Now when he owned it he had a private plate on. He only retained the plate the same day as we did the transaction, I stupidly sold my current vehicle the same day, assuming I would be able to tax and insure it. Problem is. The previous owner (family friend) is still waiting for the v5 to arrive back on the original plate. I now own the car and need to travel to a holiday in 2 days time. He did the retention on the 22-10-25 like a week ago. Is there any way I can tax the vehicle and then insure it without him having received the v5 back. He then needs to transfer ownership to me using the v5c but obviously we are waiting for that. Is there any way I can drive it until I can get that. He is a family friend so would consent to me driving it. But what would I do about insurance. As even when the v5 comes in the post it’s still in his name. Until we then transfer it over online. 

Any advice greatly greatly appreciated. ",0,1761777247.0,1,CartalkUK,1761852997,2025-10-29 22:34:07,2025-10-30 19:36:37,AnythingSilent7005 (Score: 1): [chassis number insurance](https://www.adrianflux.co.uk/chassis-number/)

I'm looking at changing my current car which is a 2018 Toyota Yaris icon 1.5 petrol.

I have looked at and considered different options and have currently narrowed it down to 5 possible choices.

1- Toyota Corolla. Decent value and equipment if a little dull.

2- Toyota CHR (most likely old shape due to budget. Cool looking car, good equipment if a little cramped and dark in the back.

3- Honda Civic. Nice looking car, good space inside if a little pricey.

4- Honda HRV. Decent value compared to the Civic if possibly not as practical.

5- Nissan Juke. Styling wise I like it, price wise it's pretty good and equipment is good too.

One thing which does put me off Nissan is the current climate around the struggles of the company and a story about the Juke being the least reliable new car in the UK.

Classic case of Audi saying a service interval is X (20k miles) when it should actually be Y (5k miles like any other car) so the people who in 100k miles have only serviced it 5 times are complaining of issues with it 

Look after it and it’ll be fine . It’s obvious when it goes wrong and you can get warning it’s wearing out waaaaay in advance by checking the timing on VCDS

If you’re coming from BMWS this is no worse to look after than an N57 or similar large capacity diesels. Generally they’re fine , yes you can delete the EGR and DPF but make sure it’s mapped for such removals 

I get 42mpg general usage (bit of urban then a long stint of straights) on the way to my work. A full tank lasts me the whole month. Tax is cheap and the cars fun to own because it’s a different kind of toque that I had in my old 335d , it comes on boost much much quicker. Youll also only get the v6 tdi mated to a quattro system so no stupid HALDEX junk to look after . 

Make sure you get a good service history, if the car doesn’t have one just list your concerns from this post and get some cash off or basically force them into a warranty (which most places provided 2-3 years if you’re buying approved second hand dealers) to not stress about it 

I have a c7.5 allroad and I love it to death, the car feels sturdy and the engine gives no impression of flimsiness or unreliability at all. Audi do a much better job at large capacity engines , id be more alarmed with your current 2 litre then the 3 litre diesel

Basically, I bought a car and the engine seemingly died after 4 months. It started cutting out randomly when driving and didn't start. I took it to a garage and they found metal fragments in the oil, which they said were likely from a damaged crankshaft bearing.   
  
I took it back to the dealership and after I tried rejecting the car under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, they rejected my rejection as they are allowed one repair of the vehicle - all they did was a full oil inspection, found no metal fragments, and found that the diesel pressure sensor was faulty. They ""fixed"" the problem and provided images and videos of the full oil inspection, and you can see that there isn't any metal in the oil, but the oil could be from a different car since they didn't document the oil being drained from the car. It's just a video of them pouring the oil into my car's oil filter.  
  
If anyone's experienced this, or anyone has any ideas on what I should do next, please let me know - any help is greatly appreciated.

Mild cracking (which refers to surface cracks with no cords visible) will be noted, for example, as an advisory on the MOT, as it requires monitoring. When it deepens and exposes the cords, then it becomes unsafe, resulting in an automatic fail on the MOT.

The comments in here about the dealer trying to push you past the 30 day rejection window are total nonsense for two reasons. Firstly, you have already reported the issue within the 30 days and the dealer acknowledged it, so your rights *on this particular issue* would remain even if the dispute goes past 30 days. And secondly, the dealer has acknowledged the problem is theirs so even if this had happened outside the 30 days, you would be within the six month window in which they have one chance to repair or to replace or refund under CRA 2015 anyway.

What we're unsure on is whether to lease or buy a car and potentially sell it afterwards.

We don't know for definite whether we'll need the car after the year she's working, and I know leasing would allow us to use something a little newer and more enjoyable for that period. I don't know if it would be worth the money for that amount of time, or just buy something that won't lose tons of value and sell it if we don't want to keep it after.

My advice is to approach it with an open mind and focus on the lease deals themselves.

Instead, visit a comparison site, see what’s available, and then narrow it down to the ones you wouldn’t mind driving.

The last time I leased a car, it turned out to be smaller and less practical than I needed, but it surprised me in good ways. I ended up with a BMW X2 back in 2018—not ideal for my situation, but it had a phenomenal stereo, and I was paying peanuts for it every month! Since I was paying so little for it I didn't mind renting the occasional larger car when I needed it.

Ignore the fact you have to hand the car back after 3 or so years, almost everyone who buys a car on PCP does that anyway.

Buying a new car is always going to be expensive though, no matter how you pay for it, a lightly used car will always be a lot cheaper and with most manufacturers offering 7 year warranties the new car has less appeal."

1oj30il,Anyone else had pedal or floor vibration on a 6 Series GT?,"Hi everyone,

I’m hoping to hear from other BMW owners — or anyone with technical insight — about a vibration issue I’ve been dealing with.

I recently bought a BMW 6 Series GT from an official BMW dealer in the UK (I’d rather not name them right now). During the test drive I noticed a vibration through the accelerator pedal and floor, particularly when driving uphill or under load. I mentioned it immediately, and the dealer said they’d sort it before delivery.

When I collected the car, the vibration was still there. Since then I’ve taken it back several times. They’ve checked and rebalanced the wheels, inspected the propshaft doughnuts (guibos), engine and gearbox mounts, differential, and even removed the undertrays to look at everything underneath. Each time, they tell me the car is “operating normally” and that the vibration is a characteristic of the model.

The problem is, I’ve driven another 6 Series GT of the same model and spec that was completely smooth — no vibration at all. Another BMW dealer has even told me this shouldn’t be happening and advised me to reject the car under the Consumer Rights Act.

I actually really like this car, so I’m reluctant to reject it if there’s a real fix. I just want to know whether anyone else has experienced this same issue and what the cause turned out to be. Was it driveline-related (propshaft, diff, mounts), tyre-related, or something else?

Any insights, experiences, or advice would be massively appreciated. This whole thing has been more stressful than it should be, and I just want to get the car back to the smooth BMW feel it’s meant to have.

Thanks in advance!

1oj1beh,Need 2 larger cars on a budget. Suv style. 10-12k ish all in. Ideas ?,"So I’m driving a 2010 BMW 318i right now. It’s got almost 140k miles, and the clutch might need doing soon, also has alot of rust now at the wheel arches. It’s also never had the timing chain done, but there hasn’t been a need yet, no loss in power, gets checked at servicing with a camera and the guides are all good so far. My partner drives a 2012 Ford Fiesta, super clean, about 80k miles, and it’s had the timing done. We’ve got a new baby on the way, so we’ll be a family of four, and my mother-in-law just bought a farmhouse that neither of our cars can quite reach, there just too low to the ground and its likely going to be over a year or so before she gets the road and access sorted, she is our baby sitter, so we’re having trouble.

We’ve been eyeing SUV-ish options within our budget, mainly used Ford Kugas around 2015-ish. The plan is a 2.0 diesel, and I’m trying to steer clear of the PowerShift and EcoBoost models (though the 2017s have nicer grills). For about £5k we’re seeing cars with around 90k–100k miles, which is lower than mine and only a bit higher than hers. It’s proving hard to find something comparable we actually like or that seems reliable. We checked out the Nissan Qashqai, but neither of us is into it. We both want Android Auto, so we’ll probably swap in new head units in whatever we buy, so we have been checking on ali express and the likes for the cars we like to ensure there is something we can get for a reasonable price.

We'll follow up with a proper blog on this later in the week, but for now here are some key and interesting takeaways:

*""historic vehicles account for only 0.2% of all miles driven in the UK"".* 

Conclusion: it's a bit pointless and senseless to tax old cars environmentally. It's even worse to destroy an old car by stripping out its engine and replacing it with an electric motor. Their impact is tiny.



*""The historic vehicle sector now contributes £7.3 billion annually to the UK economy"".*

Conclusion: we'll probably get taxed horribly at some point anyway.



*""more than 22.7 million adults regard historic vehicles as a vital part of Britain’s heritage"".*

Conclusion: A surprising number of people love classic cars. Is it time for a ""listing"" registry (like buildings enjoy) to protect this heritage?



*""Encouragingly, the under-35s now show the most significant interest in historic vehicles"".*

Conclusion: Classic cars have a strong future ahead, although the definition of a classic is constantly changing. We see this in auction values: it's much harder to sell pre-war cars now, as most collectors don't have an emotional attachment to them. Conversely, 80s cars fly off the books!

I currently drive a petrol Focus ST-Line, latest model, just turning 2 years old and the end of November is the end of a 0% interest PCP deal (£350 per month, 18k miles per year allowance, £0 deposit).

I commute 1.5 hours 2-3 days a week. The Focus is perfectly comfortable for me, no issues there. Getting 52-56MPG

I never intended to buy the car at the end, as I expected to move to another PCP deal - but the prices on new cars are silly, I can't have an EV (driveway lacking), and I'm less of a PCP fan these days.

I can buy my Focus out for £13.5k, it has 34,000 miles on it, and seems about the going rate from Auto trader so no massive 'gain' here. Runs perfectly of course, no issues, no wet belt (newer model), but I'm wondering how many miles a petrol ecoboost will give me.

OR - I can give that car back and end the deal, and grab a Mondeo like this one (examples of different trim levels range from 3.5k to 8k). 

From reading this sub, the Mondeo 2.0 tdci can go on for 200-300k if looked after, manual is fine for me (no bad Ford auto boxes to worry about) and based on this sub, you get a lot of car for the money.

Sure it's not as pretty, and will be an older car, but potentially more confortable and more features/spec for a lower monthly loan payment (which will also eventually end and I'll be driving payment free for some time hopefully).

I just can't decide if this is a silly move, so would appreciate thoughts/opinions. Do I just buy the reliable, 'known' Focus with a loan over 4 years to keep the same monthly payment (and hope to get more years out of it?).

1oiz3kv,Buying the right BMW and deciding as an enthusiast to buy with your heart or your head.,"Longish post to provide as much context as possible.


I think one of the greatest things about BMW's of 2010-2020 is the sheer variety they come in, especially in terms of cars that are so similar, yet different, they truly do offer something for everyone, especially if you're a car enthusiast.

Let's say in the next year or two I'm looking to buy another car. Currently I own a Jaguar XF V8 08. I love this car, it's got a sublime ride quality, irons out all the imperfections while still giving great feedback of the cars positioning, and offering a ""sporty"" ride. I'm very biased to Jaguar, as compared to the big 3 German, they've a bit of an underdog, and it's certainly an emotional purchase. When it comes to replacement, the natural choices will either be an F type (100% heart 0 head) X260 XF 3.0d (50 heart 50 head) I'm a single, so no real need for rear seats, and plan to stay child free.


Now BMW as a brand, I have no attachment for. As an enthusiast brand, they attract enthusiastic drivers, who I'm sure regardless where you live, have the same reputation, and without a doubt, I'll end up exactly like those drivers, or at least have someone (many) mutter to themselves when I go past. My best friend has a BMW, and he's that driver...

However, all of that aside. When just looking at the facts of the cars BMW have produced. I can't deny, how they just tick every box for me. Firstly, I love diesel, so I'm only considering them( F type exception to the rule). I love the power, the whole experience the car offers in terms of ergonomics with how the cabin is angled to the driver, the feeback the car gives. The only caveat which is the foam feeling steering wheel, but that can be addressed.


Now let's say I go 100% with my head, and go against my heart and choose a BMW and it's a 30d,
 (35d is better but requires more maintenance, and is more complicated, and I can live without AWD.)


I'm now spoilt for choice.
The classic saloon 330d.
Gran Turismo 330d
The coupe 430d.
The 4 door coupe 430d.


I'm drawn more towards the 430d for it's sporty looks, and would say this would rival the F type choice.
And the 330d gran turismo, for the comfort, and continental crossing appeal and this would rival the XF choice.


My two questions are this.

These are four very similar cars, how do you split the hairs between them, and make sure a year later you wished you bought a different one.

And when buying a car as an enthusiast, would it be a mistake by ignoring my heart, and going with my head by choosing the BMW.

My only concern is no V5 yet as I am waiting on a V62 application to go through. 

Any help is appreciated",1,1761701205.0,4,CartalkUK,1761852997,2025-10-29 01:26:45,2025-10-30 19:36:37,"Duckdivejim (Score: 1): Is it a Cat S or N car?

You would also need to advise the insurance company it’s a cat car. Most don’t care these cars because write offs are so common but do tell them as if it’s not declared they may use it to void your policy in a claim.

You should be fine to just insure it.

Please google ‘putting a cat car back on the road’ for mot requirements etc and make sure the car is legal to drive before driving it on the road on your insurance will be void.

That is a warning sign. Fair enough that it may well be a large amount of money. But they can transfer the money via online banking

no73 (Score: 3): The whole 'pay by cheque' thing stinks, as it's quite possible for them to give you a dud cheque which will bounce after a week or more, at which point they're gone with the vehicle. I suppose there's an outside chance the buyer is an OAP who doesn't trust modern electronic means of payment, but it seems unlikely. 


Tell them you'll accept it, but will only complete the paperwork and release the vehicle after the funds have cleared with your bank. I bet they'll ghost immediately. "

Manual or automatic is fine. I don’t really care. Was looking at some E series 320d’s but feeling a bit put off with timing chain issues.

Find a no rust example with good engine history, they will do 500,000 miles if maintained well enough. Keep the auto box oil clean and that will go along with it.
