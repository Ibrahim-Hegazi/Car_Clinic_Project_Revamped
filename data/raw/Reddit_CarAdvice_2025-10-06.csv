Since they have sat outside for so long in the Canadian weather, what should I do before starting them to prevent any damages? I have asked around and these are some of the recommendations I got. 

1. Just start them! Let them run for a while then change the oil. 
2. Put in some water remover into the fuel tank as the gas has likely separated from the lack of fuel stabilizer and octane booster to make the fuel better before starting. 
3. Talked to a Motul Rep and he suggested putting in a bottle of Motul Fuel System Cleaner and a bottle of Engine Clean. Let the engine idle for 15 minutes then change the engine oil. 
4. Change all the fluids first to rid of the deposits before starting. 
5. Remove the fuel pump fuse, crank the engine until the oil pressure light comes on. Put back fuse and start the engine. Drive it for a while before changing the oil.

It stays this way for differing amounts of time, and turning the vehicle off and back on, or disconnecting the battery does not fix it.

Similarly, the doors will not be lockable with the button inside or the key randomly, and it will stay this way for a different amount of time every time it happens. 

When these issues subside everything functions fine.

So this car has had water issues for a while, about a month ago I had to replace all the hoses as they had mostly dry rotted, but the water pump itself also has a leak to the point to where it has to be filled before every trip. About 2 days ago my partner noticed a squealing sound (just replaced serpentine about 6 months ago so not that) and it seemed the leak was getting worse. On the way to work he had to pull over as he saw his temp gauge going up (didn’t get to the red) but he let it cool off a few minutes and then went to work and it didn’t give him any more issues. It normally would only start getting hot at stops but he said it was while he was driving. On the way home however, he had cut it off at a red light to avoid overheating and when he went to crank it it won’t crank. At all, in the video you can see the battery isn’t the issue, I did try jumping it a couple times just to be sure but nothing from that. I’m not hearing any sounds when I try to crank. I took apart the dash so I can access the fuses because I saw that sometimes the issue is the starter relay but looking at the diagram in the manual it’s not showing any of those fuses as being attached to the starter. I’m more than fine buying a new starter and replacing it, I just don’t want to do that if it’s not the problem. To my knowledge it never really struggles to crank though I do think it’s happened a couple times.

It’s a pain in the ass, but every time you get gas, set an alarm on your phone or something to check and top up the oil once it cools down after you drive home. You COULD do them at 3k, and TECHNICALLY there’s gonna be a difference, but barely and who cares. There’s plenty of people with your same exact car forgetting to change it until 8k and they’re fine. The much more important issue, and much more damaging issue if ignored, is cars like yours and mine burning enough oil between oil changes that they run low pretty consistently. Half the reason everybody says early oil changes is bc half the people driving around can’t be bothered to top up their oil. New is better than none, but topping up is cheaper than new. So yes, there technically would be a benefit to doing 3k, and it’s your money to do what you want with, but if you can make a habit of checking the oil level/color often, you’ll be fine.

I also noticed the noise gets quieter/less frequent if I really press the brake pedal all the way, like forcefully. What could it be? A bad CV axle?

Two issues that could be related but I am not sure. The first is when the car is on a forward incline (so car rolls forward) if I reverse aggressively I hear a very loud clunk and I could feel it under my feet. The second is when I am cruising and then press the gas to accelerate, the rpm rises for half a second before coming back. So for example I am cruising and rpm is 1800.

1nyxpgo,P0306 versus engine failure,"2017 Ford Explorer had a rough idle in the morning. A few hours later, it through the P0306 code and immediately stalled. Horrible gas smell. Thick smoke out the exhaust. We had it towed to a trusted mechanic. 

Mechanic claims they tried to start the car and the engine made a horrible noise. They declared the engine had siezed, most likely in cylinder 6. $6K replacement. Ok. 
 
I let the car sit for 3 weeks untouched at the shop. Decide to tow it back home and deal with it after Christmas (I get a work bonus). 
 
Here is the strange thing.... The tow truck guy started it and drove it on/off his truck. Again, horrible smell and smoke.

If not, then that's another red flag on the diagnosis of what's wrong and what's needed to fix it. 

Without being able to test it myself by doing a compression test on cylinder 6, a cooling system pressure test or testing for exhaust gasses in the coolant, it could just be a blown head gasket. Were any of these tests done?

The gas smell could be from the fuel injector on cylinder 6 got stuck open, flooding it with fuel. If that happened, it may have washed the oil off the cylinder walls which could damage the piston, piston rings and the cylinder walls. If it ran like that too long, it will require a new engine. If there was enough unburned fuel in the cylinder, because that fuel is a liquid and liquids don't compress, the pressure built up to the point that it blew the head gasket out and that's when it started smoking. If it reached that point then piston, piston ring and cylinder damage is very likely. Further examination of cylinder 6 with a borescope will be needed to check for damage."

The computer says I want 14.2 v and the alternator replies I'm trying to make 14.3. If the numbers are close enough the computer is happy. But if the alternator stops replying, the computer freaks out. But on top of that because of the miscommunication the alternator also stops making voltage, eventually killing the battery. If you unplug the 3 pin harness on the alternator it will just default to making 13.5 volts, but the computer will be pissed. You can get around that in the wiring if you want. What really sucks is they do not test for this when they rebuild the alternator. So, if you get a cheap one from the parts store it will probably do the same thing.

I was considering the Exide EA1000 (flooded, 12V 100Ah, 900A) for 115€, but from doing some reading there seems to be some downsides: it self-discharges faster, needs water top-ups, and may charge less efficiently or wear faster in this system.

I have a honda fit, a SUV, and a BMW

I had this 16 bmw 328 gt for almost 5 years. Black exterior and red interior. I took him very well. However, it has been 90k miles. 

This summer, I changed my job and moved to a small town. The closest dealer is about 55 min away. There are 2 import car shops that can work on BMW in town.  Last week I took it to the dealer for a maintaince and a warning on the dashboard. They told me the transfer case is fine but might has some eletrical potential issues. It would not affect the driving or anything but it has the possible fails in the future. The replacement with OEM and labor would be $6k. Of course, they said it can be done in a 3rd party and buy my own parts. I estimated it and it would be around $2.5k.

I just started my career and dont want put too much effort/time/money on cars. When I was back 10 years ago, a young guy, I would love to sleep in my car. Now, I feel like the car should be something that can help my life feel peaceful, smooth. and not-bothering, just takes me from A to B effectively and efficiently. 

  
But I DID love this BMW, driving feel, outlook, features, huge space of the trunk as a GT, and he has been with me for years, though the maintainance and the gas are both very expensive.

I thought about one whole night with very limited sleep jumping from the sensibility and rationality. Finally, a online car platform showed up at my door and tow the BMW with a check left.

  
I thought I may miss him badly

  
I did miss him, but I did feel more relief and all the burden off.

1nydgck,Need advice on replacing cracked passenger window after theft attemp,"There was a theft attempt in my car recently, and the passenger side window ended up with three small cracks in the corner. Unfortunately, it looks like I’ll need to replace the entire glass. I’d prefer not to contact my insurance since it would go on my record.

I found a vendor on eBay with great reviews selling the exact replacement glass for my car’s make and model. I’m thinking of buying it there to save on parts cost.

Since I don’t have the tools to do it myself, I plan to hire someone for the replacement.

- What’s a reasonable labor cost for this kind of job?

- How do I negotiate or make sure I’m not overcharged?

- Is it better to go through a local auto glass shop or a mobile repair service?

Any advice or cost estimates from people who’ve done this recently would be super helpful! I'm located in Seattle, Washington if that helps. Thank you!

I assume you will have the plentiful options that come from looking at the used market? Anything new is expensive.


Mazda makes a lot of crossovers. 


Honda could have some solid Crvs and pilots from back when the pilots were smaller. 


Toyota has potential to be pricey but will be solid most likely.


Maybe those options come up for a reason, the ones you mentioned, ya know? As in they are not desired - something to consider 


There are certainly lots of options and it's probably best to look at it at a case by case basis as some specific models and or years should be avoided, but you can kind of get a general idea to narrow your search down too"

1nyxujz,Help me identify what's causing this noise,"Hey all,
I've been having this noise coming from my 2017 Chevy Malibu for over a month now. I've taken this to multiple service centers in town, paid for diagnostics and no one is able to identify what is causing this noise or fix it correctly. It usually comes in after a cold start and after driving for a while you can't hear the noise anymore. 

The first service center straight up said they couldn't figure out what was causing the noise. The second one said it was a stuck slide pin on the calipers and they fixed it. But the noise started coming again the next day. I went back to them again after that and they said it was a rusted lug nut, which would only fix itself if I drove more (I have 58k miles on this vehicle). 

I strongly believe this is a wheel bearing issue and have asked every technician about it, but I'm no pro. So I have nothing to convince them with. All the videos I've seen on YouTube say wheel bearing noises are ""chirping"" in nature but then go on to show videos of a growling or grinding noise. They all said they checked the bearings and the bearings look fine. I don't want this to turn into a catastrophic failure or massive repair in the future, so I'm hoping someone can help me out?

While the belt is off wiggle all the other pulleys and make sure they don't deviate. Worn pulleys/bearings  can cause belts to slip off. 


Lastly check for proper orientation of the belt. There is usually a diagram on the hood or core support. 




I had a mini that was shredding belts and after closer inspection I found that the harmonic balancer bolt had worked itself loose and caused the pulley to go off center.

1nyjjw5,2013 Sprinter battery replacement — AGM or cheaper flooded option?,"I’m looking to replace the battery in my recently purchased 2013 Sprinter for vanlife. I measured the current battery with a multimeter after I couldn't start the engine and it reads 10.28V, so I assume it’s time for a new one. Using my VIN, I checked Mercedes’ specs and the van originally came with a 12V AGM, and the Sprinter’s battery management system is designed for AGM.

I was considering the Exide EA1000 (flooded, 12V 100Ah, 900A) for 115€, but from doing some reading there seems to be some downsides: it self-discharges faster, needs water top-ups, and may charge less efficiently or wear faster in this system. AGM is supposed to be maintenance-free, better for repeated starts, and more reliable for a diesel van that sits unused. There's an AGM starter battery on the same website as the Exide: (12V, 95Ah, 850A) for 160€, which is pricier.

I'm just wondering would it be wise to get the AGM option even thought it's almost 50 Euros more expensive?

To use a very simplified analogy: picture wet batteries and their lead acid/water balance like a hot tub. The hot tub needs chemicals to keep the proper and healthy balance, just like the lead acid/water balance in a wet battery has when it's new.

After a hot tub party, your hot tub's chemical balance is out of whack, so you add more ""stuff"" to rebalance it. Each vehicle start diminishes that optimal/like new lead acid/water balance just a tad. Every start diminishes its energy storing ability just a bit. After 100, 200, 300, 500 vehicle starts, the lead acid battery's balance is noticeably out of whack too, but you can't add anything to rebalance it back to optimal. The more starts that wet battery performs, the more it lessens its energy holding capacity. Just like adding more people to the hot tub. Or not rebalancing it between uses. Eventually it's got small traces of hot tub chemicals, just enough to say they were there, but not enough to be effective.

An AGM doesn't have water. It only has lead acid absorbed into fiberglass-like mats. There's nothing to dilute the lead acid. This is why they last so much longer than a wet battery.

As a wet battery's lead acid/water balance drops, so does its starting ability. It takes longer/more cranks to start, with each crank diminishing battery's balance i. Once it reaches 8-9 volts, chances are it's not enough to start your vehicle. Whereas an AGM can restart an average engine with only 10% of 12 volts remaining.

Zero charge - still good or dead? Once a wet battery reaches anything below 50% holding capacity, it can be recharged but that's putting a Band-aid on a blood gushing samurai sword cut. It'll be back to its 50% in 1 or 2 starts. Whereas an AGM can be drained dead, to flat-zero and recharged back to 100% health 800-1000x.

Cold starts: wet batteries are called wet because their main content is water. Last I checked, water still freezes. An AGM battery, as mentioned earlier, doesn't have water. Its lead acid ingredients are stored in dry fiberglass mats. There's nothing to freeze or allow cold weather to hamper its starting ability.

Cost: wet battery = cheap. AGM = not so cheap. With all the benefits of AGM over wet batteries, are AGM batteries with the extra cost? I think the answer is very obvious."

Axle showed signs of high heat with a burn mark but didn’t appear to wear the axle down.

1. Just start them! Let them run for a while then change the oil. 
2. Put in some water remover into the fuel tank as the gas has likely separated from the lack of fuel stabilizer and octane booster to make the fuel better before starting. 
3. Talked to a Motul Rep and he suggested putting in a bottle of Motul Fuel System Cleaner and a bottle of Engine Clean. Let the engine idle for 15 minutes then change the engine oil.

I usually disable the ignition coils or fuel injectors. Some engines, you can just unplug the crankshaft position sensor. Others I will just disconnect the ignition coils. On my Honda’s with a distributor you can unplug the coil easily. 

Anyways for fuel that has gone bad in the tank. There’s a few options. My old Hondas had a drain on the tank, I don’t think they’ve done that in a while though. Not even sure if there’s one on my ‘02 Accord. But if you can siphon the fuel out, I like to use a vacuum brake bleeder to do this. If not you’ll need to rub some strong fuel cleaner in there with a good amount of new fuel to help dissolve the old fuel. I liked the Techron fuel system cleaner.

When I went, I was told that the car needed a new set of brake pads and rotors (which was expected) and a new lower arm control. The next day, I was told that as he was test-driving the car, the serpentine belt broke and it needed to be replaced.

  
Fast forward to Saturday, I picked up the car with the total bill coming to $1160. Since then, I've been hearing a clicking from the wheel that the arm was replaced on, the air bag warning sign is on, and the car is showing a warning sign. When I called, he said that the CV joint most likely needed to be replaced on that side now and that the air bag light was on when it was brought in (which I don't believe to be the case).

The CV axle could be due to carelessness while changing the control arm... but the control arm failing could also have caused damage and/or just normal wear and tear left it ready to go out and the extra stress inherent in taking it apart was the last straw.

To give a little bit of a backstory, we were involved in an accident in early August where we were ran into from the back while we were sitting at a light. Mostly cosmetic, however directly after that, we noticed that there was a fuel smell in the cabin. It got worse over time till eventually I took the backseat off to access the fuel pump access hatch to see if there was a problem there, and it was very noticeable that fuel was leaking from the access hatch into the back seat. I took JB Weld and tried to patch it to see if that was my problem, and it stopped it for a short period. Now, because the smell is back, I took the rear seat off again and there's definitely fuel leaking into the backseat again. However, it seems to be in a different place. In the backseat there are two what appear to be rubber caps in the middle that I don't know if those are vents or what, but it seems to be leaking on the driver side, which is the opposite side of the fuel tank access hatch. Now, I'm thinking that it could be the gas cap not venting properly which is causing pressure to be retained inside the tank and therefore forcing its way out of any orifice it can, but the place that it's leaking doesn't make any sense to me for that to be the cause. In the photo that I have attached, there are three color portions. The red arrow dictates where the fuel access hatch is, the blue dictates the rubber vent caps (if that's what they are), and yellow dictates where the fuel is currently pooling up.

1nytokc,moog ev260 inner tie rod question - how should they feel out of the box when brand new,"I have 2006 buick lucerne cxl model car with v6 3.8L engine

I was planning to replace the inner tie rods on the front end.

I purchased two moog ev260 from [rockauto.com](http://rockauto.com) located here: [https://www.rockauto.com/en/moreinfo.php?pk=202536&cc=0&pt=7428&jsn=3](https://www.rockauto.com/en/moreinfo.php?pk=202536&cc=0&pt=7428&jsn=3)

Opening the first package the ball joint is is tight. I can't move it at all by hand. It feels very stiff and unworkable to move by hand. If I was to say it felt almost impossible to move by hand unless you really held it in place and put some tremedeous force on it. I wasn't sure if the grease was dried out but when I put it in a table vice and held it in place I can move the tie rod up down, left and right and in various directions. In the vice it feels firm and still stiff but is movable. Outside the table vice I can't move it by hand. Whatever direction I put it in the tie rod is able to hold itself stationary regardless of its position under its own weight.

The second inner tie rod however I can move the ball joint by hand freely with ease and in all directions. There is very little give and moves smooth without resistance regardless what direction i put it. Regardless of whatever direction or position I put the tie rod in it will hold that position under its own weight and not move.

I have never installed inner tie-rods before.

I have a feeling one of these brand new parts is defective out of the box.

Google says New tie rods should feelstiff, solid, and tight, with no movement, clicking, grinding, or looseness in the joint. They should only move under significant force or when installed on the car and subjected to wheel turning torque, not freely or with play in your hand.

I would just like some opinions on my situation and for those who have dealt with moog parts or just inner tie rods in general and how they should feel out the box when brand new.",1,1759683789.0,3,AskMechanics,1759779285,2025-10-05 17:03:09,2025-10-06 19:34:45,SuitableGain4565 (Score: 1): The second one is suspect

To me, this looks like K-Seal or something equivalent. Fibers and silicate ran through a coolant system to temporarily seal leaks at the head gasket. It basically makes glass at the leak. It's an okay temporary fix until you save up the money or time to do a proper head gasket replacement or whatever else may be the source of the leak.

That coolant looks dirty and possibly original, though. Coolant should be exchanged on some frequency (OEM book is based on the recommended coolant). The antifreeze doesn't stop working, but the additives that help prevent corrosion do deplete overtime. So if it isn't K-Seal, it could very well be rust and/or organics.

Two Hayabusa engines powering a single vehicle v8 style with cad created mounting brackets to mount both motors in a v8 style pattern two chains connected too 2 different drive shafts one goes to the rear and the other is routed to the front

One engine goes to the rear with a standard axle setup .


One engine is routed the around where the rear of the original engine would have sat, then connects to a boat V-drive to power the front wheels.


Basically, it’s AWD, but instead of a traditional transfer case, the one front engine uses a V-drive to split and route power. It’s compact, can handle high RPMs, and keeps the engine placement flexible.

I’m curious if anyone has seen something like this done before, or if there are obvious pitfalls I’m missing. Thoughts on cooling, chain/belt alignment, or drivetrain stress would be super helpful.

I own a 2016 Hyundai Tucson Eco with a 1.6L 4 cylinder engine with 116k miles on it. I bought it second hand about a year ago and haven’t had many issues with it. Ive changed oil and filter every 4k miles so far and it was due for another soon. Early on I had changed the spark plugs because it would sputter excessively at low rpm’s (Around 3k) and was quite annoying when stuck in traffic. The problem had mostly disappeared until today. I had just driven about 300 miles across state two days prior with no problem and had been running errands just fine. Today the check engine light started flashing. The engine was shaking pretty bad when accelerating and I noticed even at idle it was a bit rough. I managed to make it to a pep boys a couple miles away but it was probably like 15 minutes away and I tried to coast when I could. The code was for a general misfire and there were other codes for the individual misfires. The mechanic told me that Hyundai’s and Kia’s are know for crappy engines and bad oil consumption. I’ve notice during oil changes low oil levels but nothing too concerning. I’m waiting on the mechanic to officially diagnose it and most likely change the spark plugs and coil pack. I’m mostly concerned with making it home back across the 300 miles. My main 2 questions are if that 15 minutes of driving while misfiring will affect the engine longterm and if I should keep it after addressing the problem?

The fuel rail pressure sensor measures the pressure from the fuel pump to the fuel rail and injectors.  A low circuit code means either a short to ground internal to the sensor or harness.  It could also be extremely low fuel pressure, but that should set other codes.  Your FRP sensor should be a 3 wire sensor (signal, 5v reference, and ground). At 0psi it should be approximately 0.5v on the signal wire, at max fuel pressure it should be approximately 4.5v.  Normal idle should be in the 2.5v to 3.5v range, sorry I can't be more specific.  I'm just a lowly Ford Senior Master and I'm basing my readings off how a Ford FRP operates, which should be more or less the same as everyone else.  The FRP sensor should be screwed into the fuel injection rail.  If you unplug the sensor and have a multimeter, you should be able to verify which wire is the 5v reference at minimum.  With a wiring diagram you could also verify that the signal and ground circuits aren't either open, or shorted to ground.  If you do those things, and the wiring all passes, then you're looking at an internally shorted to ground FRP sensor.  The 5v reference signal is supplied by the PCM (engine/power train computer) and is typically shared among several other sensors, so it's possible that another sensor could be dragging that one down, but you'd need a wiring diagram to confirm as such.

1nyvdiv,Cupra Leon VZ1 or BMW 2.0135i 1 Series?,"For context, I am looking at selling my 1.4 Turbo Black Edition Corsa in the near future as it is approaching 11 years old and 76k miles and I don't want to keep it when things start to go wrong. 

I have been looking at a large jump in quality of car as I have come across some money which can help go towards one as well as starting a new job which I can easily put away a few hundred pounds a month to help contribute to the cost of a new car. 

  
I don't drive too far (my work is a 20 min drive each way and bi - weekly drive to Loughborough from Lincoln) and I'm not incredibly knowledgeable of cars hence why I am asking for some help. I am willing to spend about 20k on a car and the two which I have been interested in are a Cupra Leon VZ1 and a BMW 2.0M135i 1 series. I've seen that you can get a 71 plate Leon with around 20k miles, a 71 BMW which has around 30k miles, however that is a bit over the budget but I am willing to save more for it, if the benefits outweigh the extra cost. I am wanting to go for a sporty car with at least 200bph as a minimum and I also like the dark interior looks of the two car models but I am open to other suggestions too.

Basically is there any massive red flags in either car or a significant advantage that one will hold over the other?

1nyuzd3,First time buying a car without input from my Dad - would like some advice,"All my cars (prior to my current one) were bought and maintained for me by my Dad. I bought my current car in desperation and regret not speaking to my Dad about it before I did it (he did not let me forget it)

I'm now in the market for a different car but I lost my Dad a few years ago so I'm going at it alone.

Having not kept up with the car market in a long time, I'm really finding myself in a bit of a mindfield and struggling to make a rational decision. I've got quite a small budget (£5k) and a small shopping list but I feel like I'm coming up short when looking on Autotrader or on local trade sites.

My non-negotiables:

* Height adjustable driver seat (and ideally passenger)
* Cruise control
* Suitable for DIY fixes + upgrades

Ideally:

* Wide legroom
* Can chew motorway miles without being loud or slugish
* Reverse parking camera
* Isn't going to cost me the some crazy amount in repairs in the next year or so
* Will be suitable for the next >5 years
* Be able to handle some less than smooth roads.

No kids, no commuting. Will be making long motorway journeys every couple of months.

Autotraders filters have given me some good ideas and have short listed to:

2007 1.5dCi Nissan Qashqai - 92,700 miles

2016 1.4i Vauxhall Astra - 91,000 miles

2008 1.6D Volvo C30 - 60,000 miles

2013 1.6 TDI Audi A3 - 131,000 miles

2014 1.5dCi Nissan Juke - 100,000 miles

My reluctance to get another car is the unknown and looking through quite a few posts here, I'm not sold on either Nissan but the Qashqai is only £2.2k so a solid choice in cost.

Are there any other makes/models I should be looking at or should I up my budget and get something better?

It's partly mitigated by regular oil changes but there's plenty of examples of well looked after & unmodified cars spinning main bearings. 

BMW have a bit of a history with chains & rod bearings on a lot of their line-up but some are better than others, and the 6 pot diesels of that generation aren't necessarily any more reliable than the rest of the line-up, but the torque & economy on offer is brilliant.

The membrane just just protects the inside from moisture ingress, but needs to be fixed on tight, also so that it doesn't catch on the door card, lock rods, cover fixing points, etc.

1nyqakv,BMW X3 / Lexus RX / Mercedes GLC - which (if any) would you buy used?,"Hello I hope it is ok to ask this here but any advice on the relative merits of the bmw x3, Mercedes glc, or Lexus rx? (2020-2023)

I’ve currently got a 2020 Tiguan and while I think it’s a lovely car it’s been no end of problems and the vw dealer / warranty experience has been atrocious so I’ve decided to sell it while the residual value is still relatively high. 

I don’t care about “luxury” at all but my wife does, so I would like to accommodate that. We looked at the Toyota rav4 which I loved but she hated the interior and I can understand why. I was therefore interested in the Lexus rx but the used prices seem on the steep side and there isn’t a lot of stock around. I know a lot of people with x3s and glcs all of whom have had no issues but I am wary of premium German brands because it’s just not something that interests me and I worry it’s the gateway to more time and money at the garage. 

Ultimately I just want something reliable that is premium enough for my wife and is close to having the practicality that the Tiguan does, as in all other areas than reliability it’s been perfect. What would you buy for £24-36k?",1,1759675990.0,7,CartalkUK,1759779285,2025-10-05 14:53:10,2025-10-06 19:34:45,"Guilty_Spite_4426 (Score: 7): Lexus, Lexus, Lexus. You might consider prices of the RX steep as they are usually compared against X5's and GLE, the Lexus NX is the X3 and GLC equivalent. 

Check insurance prices however, as they are a quick steal and targeted by thieves.

warfoo09 (Score: 4): Reliability wise BMW and GLC won't be any better than your Tiguan, unfortunately German quality has been appalling recently - had a new BMW with a B47 engine and it's been nothing but trouble.

If an EV is suitable (ie, you have off road parking), then a tesla Model Y is about the best in class. Interior isn't quite as nice as the Lexus, it's more VW and BMW in quality, but it's better in every other way (I went from a lexus NX in top end Premier spec, to a tesla Model Y AWD LR, it's like going from VHS to 4k HDR). The outgoing model which is what you'll get was voted the most reliable EV in 2025 by owners. 

They can't be stolen, esp with pin to drive set, short of a crane. Even if they nicked your phone or keycard, they can't drive off. At least check it out."

1nyp9se,Need some advice about damage to my car.,"I went to get in my car this afternoon to go shopping in town and noticed it had been keyed all along the passenger side. Not only that but also a crack in the bumper and a large gash on the bodywork above the wheel.

The other day I parked legally on my road, not causing an obstruction, totally legally parked. A neighbour came out shouting at me that I’m parked in “his” parking place. I calmly told him that I’m legally parked on the road. He doubled down that that’s where he always parks. I told him that I’m legally parked and that he doesn’t own the road in front of his house. He didn’t like that and stormed off in a huff.

He owns an old work truck and it looks like he had no problem banging it into the passenger side bumper and then scraping it along the passenger side. It was then keyed twice all along the passenger side. I can’t prove that it was him because I didn’t see it happen, and I don’t have a dash cam.

I don’t know what to do. Do I call the insurance company first thing in the morning? Will my premiums go up as a result? If I owned the car I would just repair it as and when I could afford to, but it’s a lease car and the contract ends in May 2027, so I can’t return the car as it is without consequences. It’s a 2024 VW Polo.

I’m just really worried and I don’t know what to do? Volkswagen would probably charge an extortionate amount to repair it. A local body shop might charge less, but it’s probably not going to be cheap. If I go through my insurance will my premiums go up? I’ve never had to make a claim in 17 years of driving. I’m just gutted. I can’t believe someone would be so shitty about ‘their’ so called parking space.

Please could you give me some advice on what I should do? Obviously I’ve not parked my car anywhere near ‘his’ space since. Lesson learned. But why are some people like this? I think there’s a rule that I have to report damage within 24 hours to the insurance company? Is that true?

Sadly, almost certainly, even though it's obviously ""no fault"" on your part.  One issue is that there's no-one for your insurer to reclaim the money from, but even when there is, renewal premiums tend to rise after a claim.

That said, whilst your current insurer will very probably raise your renewal premium, you may well still be able to get a very similar, or at least competitive, quote from another insurer (even though you'll obviously have to declare the claim).

Fwiw, this is what just happened to me. My car was rear‑ended and needed a new bumper, sensors, lights, part‑respray, etc, which I made a claim for.  My then-insurer hiked my renewal by 50%, but a different insurer quoted only £10 more than my last year's premium.

Also, given the amount of damage you've described, the cost of fixing it yourself is likely to be considerably more than any increase in premium, especially as, legally speaking, you're obliged to tell your insurer about the ""accident"" whether you claim through them or not."

They buy from auction (usually stuff just off leases/PCP). and sell on without much if any profit. They really exist to get you on finance deals and upsell other products (usually pointless stuff like fabric protection, extended warranties etc) and by charging admin fees. 

They want cars in and out quickly. The car could be good or shite. They don't really check. Better to hope they're fine and they'll fix stuff as they have to under the Consumer Rights Act if they need to.

Also means they sometimes similar cars priced the same. So you can sometimes get a good deal on a high spec model. But the price on a unloved car can be the same as one that was doted upon. Lots of people don't spend a penny on a lease as they know they'll give it back before long.  So you just need to really do your research and check the history yourself carefully. Best chance of getting a good deal and avoiding a dog.

Just be wary the people there will likely have no idea about the car. Don't have the service history. Will pressure the sale and upsells and will probably not have great after sales support. 

They can also be strict for stuff like test drives (on short, accompanied, if over 25 or had a licence a certain amount of time etc).

Honda Civic Type R FL5

I couldn't find a Golf R or Civic FL5 to try locally but have driven all the other cars on that list.
