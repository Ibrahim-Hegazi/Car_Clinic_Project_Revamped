Spray out the slide pin hole, run the bore brush through it with some more cleaner, then I run another corner of a rag down with a flat screwdriver and twist until spotless. Wipe down the pins, thin layer of grease, and run them in and out of their holes just to get the grease evenly dispersed. Then I put a dab of extra grease in the boot and reassemble. Don’t use anything oil based on rubber, it can soften and ruin the rubber, while brake cleaner is rough on rubber it evaporates quickly before it can do any damage.

Hoping this is allowed 

I know this is a long post, but I would sincerely appreciate anybody’s insight if they took the time to read it

I’m aware most of you drive a service truck for a living or have a shop for you 24/7. I however do not. 

Looking to start a conversation,/see what you guys would recommend to keep in your standard pickup truck tool box for the “just basic repairs” moments. 

Im good at all master of none. Primarily run machines doing site work so machine or vehicle quick repairs. Also do some carpentry but not a ton.

I’ve always had the normal weather guard  with a bunch of tangled ratchet straps, maybe a set of jumper cables and the emergency six pack in it if that. Tired of being unprepared so I just swapped mine out for the 27 inch because you can put pack outs in them the long way which allows you to have much more space. 

So far I have:

Noco Boost Pack
Screwdriver set
Drill bits / screw bits / adapter bits / hole saws
Wrenches (ratcheting and non)
Sockets normal and impact
Knives
Tape measures 
Tape assortment
Wire ties
Electrical crimp assortment & relays/switches
Fuses

Battery tools/ ratchets  (all Milwaukee)
   Impact
   Drill
   Driver
   Multitool
   Sawsall
   Blower 
   Sds hammer
   Grinder
   Grease gun
   Vacuum
   Bansaw
   12v pump
   M18 inflator 
   Multi meter
   Power probe

On list but not added yet:

Adjustable wrenchess
Pliers / channel locks / strippers / crimpers
Hammers / pry bars
Vice grip assortment 
Bolt & screw assortment

Yes, I know it’s like a clown car. All of this stuff is in there neat and there is plenty of room for what has not been added yet.

Basically what I’m asking is if you sat there and took five minutes and thought “what is some basic tool that i use all the time and would be dead in the water without?”

1mqh8al,civic hatchback issues,"hi everybody 

my boyfriend has a '95 honda civic hatchback that he has wanted for a while and has encountered some issues with it.

i dont really know much about cars but i really just want to see him happy and hope i can get some advice so maybe he can fix it because he may get rid of it as a result of the issue.

he fixed something in the bay, i think one of the head gaskets blew and so most of the car had to come apart inside to repair it. (im not 100% sure on this.) now when the car starts, there is a slapping noise that is constant when it runs. he has tightened and readjusted the timing belt several times and believes the timing belt is not the issue (although it might be). so what could it possibly be? 

i can get a video of the sound for identification. i was looking online and saw something about checking valve clearances, but i dont wanna suggest the wrong advice.

1mqgovp,Why can’t I get this AN6 power steering conversion to work!?,"I’ve been trying to convert my ls swap steering to AN6 lines, because the original lines leaked all over the place at the fittings. I’ve just found a leak on my pressure hose, the second failure on the high pressure side. But I don’t think I approached this like an idiot..

I’m runnning a Turn One HP1 pump on a 5.3 vortec. I have Fragola (Parker 206-6) hose and Fragola steel fittings on all connection points, running to a stock e46 steering rack, out to a mishimoto universal cooler, back to the pump reservoir

Line is within the bend radius spec and isn’t being held with any zip ties (that’s what I thought made the first line leak) the leak is about 3/4 of the way to the rack, on a straight hose. I don’t get why it’s leaking!

Should I just go pull a pump and hoses from a junkyard truck? I have the OG bmw banjo fittings, banjo adapters for AN6… I’ve tried this a few ways.

Is AN6 not worth it? I thought this would solve my issue with badly leaking BMW hose ends, but it’s only creating other issues. I pulled my rack-to-cooler hose and have fluid flowing out when turning the wheel, so I don’t THINK there’s any obstructions. And I was driving the car before I dove into this, it just leaked fluid from the hose ends. 

Please lend your brainpower, I’m approaching the end of my sanity trying to make this work.

After more checking  it is the push lock ends your using they are low pressure ends. You need these type of screw together or hydraulically crimped on fittings.

I drive a 2020 Toyota Tacoma with about 55k miles on it. I purchased it used a few years ago and I’ve had no repair concerns so far. I recently took it to my local shop for brakes and rotors, an oil change, and a transmission/differential/brake fluid flush. The shop recommended the fluid services the last time I saw them for an oil change, and I went forward with it as more of a “peace of mind” service. They’re pretty reliable as they never “push” recommended services, it’s more of a “hey we noticed this, so you may want to get it checked out in the future, even if it’s not by us” kind of place. Shortly after picking up the truck from the shop, the check engine light kicked on for the first time since I’ve bought the vehicle 3 years ago. I immediately called the shop to let them know, and the lead tech asked me to bring it back in so they could investigate. 

After hooking it up to OBD and getting the code, they let me know it was probably due to extra fluid somewhere as a result of the flushes they did. They let me know the scanner caught a minor misfire in cylinder 5, but they cleared the code and had no other concerns. 

I drove away from the shop again, but the check engine light kicked for a second time! After calling my mechanic, they asked me to bring the truck back as they thought I could now need a spark plug replacement as a fix. My question is, am I now responsible to foot the bill for this repair if it’s needed? I trust these guys as they’ve been taking care of my services for years now, but it’s not sitting right with me if I have to now pay for a repair that only popped up following service that they did…that I already paid a hefty bill for. If this is a situation that’s more “it was bound to happen sooner or later” then I can understand needing to pay for the potential spark plug service.

This only happens when idling/stopped, only lasts 1-3 seconds before going away, but it recurs frequently and almost every time the car comes to a stop.

I ran a diagnostic which just yielded a U0100 code: Lost Communication With ECM/PCM 'A'. (See attached photo)

I noticed some hesitation when shifting and then it had some slight trouble starting and sometimes when it started I would lose all audio like the radio, blinker sounds, but it was intermittent. Then I started having more problems starting where I would hear clicking before the engine would finally start. It would throw messages at me about stabillitrack and the antitheft system. I thought for sure it was my starter or solenoid on the starter so I took it to Autozone and they said my battery, starter, and alternator were fine. This went on for weeks to where sometimes it wouldn’t start and only click.

I changed my starter relay since the problem was intermittent and I read that a relay could get stuck in one position and cause intermittent starting problems. I thought that solved it but nope, I was still having intermittent issues starting and all sorts of messages and my gas mileage fell off a cliff. I finally found that my car would always start via the remote start but would have trouble if I used the push button start. I figured that the battery was going bad and had enough voltage to start via the remote start because it didn’t have to display the screens and other things vs not having enough power to do it with the push button where everything came on.

Long story, but I changed the battery out and everything went back to normal including my gas mileage and the hesitation even disappeared. It’s weird that a dying battery that tested OK could cause so many issues, but it’s definitely what caused my problems.

I'm not a driver, I don't know the EXACT symptoms, I will list those that I understood from my dad. 

He said before that, he felt the car wasn't as powerful. He felt it was ""lagging"" a bit. He also felt the gearbox vibrating.

truemcgoo (Score: 1): It’s probably the pinion seal. It can go if you have a poorly balanced driveshaft or a pinion bearing that goes bad. Once you hit point of metal shavings though you’re gonna need to do a diff replacement.

It’s actually not a terrible job, the only tricky part is correctly setting the backlash and getting a feel for the number of shims. If you replace your pinion gear, which will likely be needed, you also need to get the correct size pinion shim which requires getting tricky finding the correct engagement with calipers and gauges, or bro g willing to take the carrier in and out a half dozen times while using marking compound.

If you have a decent set up garage the only specialty tools you need are a dial indicator to check your lash and a bearing and race driver set. You can get these decently cheap. The parts would be new ring gear, pinion gear, inner and outer pinion bearings, and you’ll probably just want to replace your carrier bearing while you’re at it. Cut off the old bearings with a grinder ain’t worth trying to use a puller. When you put on new inner pinion bearing heat the bearing in the oven and freeze the pinion gear, it will slide right on. Don’t set the inner pinion bearing until you are 110% sure you have the pinion shim correctly sized because it ain’t coming off. It’s worth grabbing an extra inner pinion bearing and grinding out the inside so it slips on easy for the purpose of determining pinion shim sizing.

Gear old smells bad, wear old clothes.

Brake cleaner on everything helps, get everything real clean before putting the diff cover back on.

Don’t mess with the carrier too much when it’s out of the diff. Spinning your spider gears can make reassembly a royal pain. Reinsert the spider gear inner pin after disassembly. 

Actually come to think of it this job is actually pretty tricky."

There is now a tiny leak at the plug. I used a drain pan under the car to catch the leak and attached is the picture. It only leaks that much after 12 hours. I also included the pictures of the oil drain plug.

1. What is the yellow stuff around the plug? Did the shop use a sealant around the plug? I used my nail to scratch it and it came of easy.

2. Should I tighten the plug a little bit more? Like 1/8th of a turn?

3. Is it a bad washer? The inner diameter of the washer is slightly bigger than 14mm. The pictures show the washer being slightly off-center.

4. Is it time to change the drain plug? I'm thinking of switching to Fumoto Original F-106. I doesn't seem that I will need an adapter since the plug area is not recessed.

Thank you in advance for taking the time to read this. I'll do my best to include all information here.  
  
  
\- I was driving home from work one day, and over the music, I heard a fuzzy noise coming from underneath the steering column, more towards the drivers door, where the fuse box is. I didn't think much of it at the time, I actually thought it was the door speakers.  
  
When I got to my destination, the car wouldn't react to my key fob. I couldn't lock nor unlock the car with the fob.  
  
So I suspected a blown fuse. I checked the fuse box and I was correct. The fuse responsible for the central locking had blown so I replaced it but it made no difference. I now had a little blinking orange light on the drivers door indicating a fault. The drivers door lock/unlock buttons wouldn’t work either. I could hear the relay working, or at least I could hear it click whenever I tried to use the door buttons or the fob buttons.  
  
Since then, I’ve had to mechanically lock and unlock the doors.  
I took it to the local garage who started by replacing the relays. This also made no difference. I had also replaced the key fob battery by this stage for good measure. The second key didn’t work either, and that still has the original battery.  
  
On top of all this, I started having issues with the overall battery life of the car. One day I left the car off for two days, and the battery was flat. I was told it was the original battery so I should replace it. I replaced it with a brand new battery but unfortunately the problem still persists. If I leave the car off for 48 hours, it will be flat to the point where the alarm will go off and won't stop, unless I jump start the car. Certainly sounds like I have a parasitic load somewhere but I have no idea where to start with this. I have no aftermarket lights or components, the car is fully stock at the moment.  
  
Now they have asked me to take the car to Kia for a health report so they can fix it, but Kia here is charging me nearly £200/h just for a diagnostic which I find ridiculous so I’d like to try other avenues first.  
  
Any ideas, any suggestions are very much welcome at this point.

Get to an autozone if possible and scan for codes (it's free, they'll do it in the lot) to try and narrow down the issue. With luck, you just need some new spark plugs or a coil. Easy diy if you can get a ratchet, the right sockets, and an extender. Or cheap enough at any mom and pop mechanic.

But there can be things that complicate this.

Rotational tires can only stay on the same side of the car otherwise you have to unmount the tire and mount + balance it which costs money and also cannot be done at home.

Another thing that can complicate things is if you have different sized front and rear tires and/or rims. Then obviously they have to stay on the same axle.

There are also some small things that won't complicate the process but something that you might want to take into account. For example if your rear rims are bent then it is better to keep them there if you aren't planning on fixing them because they will more likely cause shaking if they are on the front axle.

Otherwise make sure you don't cross thread or over tighten the bolts but also to tighten them enough. If you don't have a torque wrench then stop by a car mechanic or tire shop and ask them to check it for you afterwards which should be free"

1mpvkel,U.S. EV Market Faces Policy Shock: Hybrids Poised to Gain as Incentives Expire,"The U.S. electric vehicle industry is entering a turbulent phase. With the July 4 signing of President Donald Trump’s new budget, the long-standing federal support that fueled EV adoption is coming to an abrupt end. The $7,500 federal EV tax credit will expire on **September 30, 2025**, along with zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) credits and fines for missing fuel economy targets.

**A Final Sales Spike Before the Drop**

The looming deadline is expected to trigger a short-lived EV sales surge in Q3 2025 as consumers rush to claim remaining incentives. Industry analysts foresee a sharp pullback in Q4, with demand potentially entering a prolonged slowdown. Cox Automotive warns of a “collapse” in sales momentum after the deadline, forcing automakers to reassess production and pricing strategies.

**EV Economics Without Subsidies**

Without federal tax credits, EV affordability will be a major challenge. While Tesla remains a market leader, even its margins have been pressured. Ford, General Motors, and other legacy automakers have yet to prove they can profitably mass-produce EVs at scale.

Ford’s new **“universal EV platform”**, announced this week, aims to change that. The company plans a $30,000 mid-sized electric pickup in 2027, using U.S.-produced LFP batteries and a redesigned assembly process to cut costs. CEO Jim Farley called it a “Model T moment” for the brand, but analysts remain skeptical—Ford’s EV division lost $1.33 billion in Q2 despite a 105% revenue jump.

 

**Hybrids as the Immediate Winner**

As EV incentives vanish, **hybrid and plug-in hybrid (PHEV)** models are emerging as the most likely beneficiaries. They offer fuel efficiency, lower upfront costs, and no reliance on charging infrastructure. Honda, Nissan, and other manufacturers are already shifting production toward hybrids in response to softer EV demand.

This mirrors the **European Union’s trend**, where hybrids now hold the largest market share (34.8%) and BEVs account for 15.6%. In the U.S., EV market share is projected to hover around **8.5% in 2025**, barely up from 2023’s 7.6%.

 



 

**China’s Competitive Edge**

While U.S. automakers recalibrate, **China’s EV sector is accelerating**. Domestic EV sales exceeded 3 million units in H1 2025, with exports surging. Chinese brands like BYD are setting benchmarks in affordability, battery technology, and in-car connectivity—offering features such as AI assistants, facial recognition, and seamless phone integration that many U.S. vehicles lack.

Ford’s Farley openly acknowledges China’s lead in in-vehicle tech, warning that Chinese innovation could enter the U.S. market in the coming years.  

 

 

**Stock Market Signals Caution**

Auto stocks reflect the uncertainty. GM shares are flat for 2025, Tesla and Toyota are down, and the broader auto manufacturing sector is off 23% YTD. Chinese automaker BYD is up 25% for the year, and Volkswagen has gained 17%, but both face competitive and market headwinds.

 **A Short-Term Boom Before the Bust**

General Motors (GM), the second-largest U.S. EV seller after Tesla, reported a **115% year-over-year sales surge in July** to 19,000 units—its strongest month yet. This spike reflects consumer urgency to lock in incentives before the September deadline.

Analysts, such as Cox Automotive’s Streaty, expect **record-breaking EV sales through Q3 2025**, followed by a steep Q4 decline as the market “adjusts to its new reality.” While this immediate slowdown might sound alarming, some industry watchers see it as a healthy reset.

“The elimination of incentives allows demand to grow more organically and be less forced,” notes Stephanie Brinley of S&P Global Mobility.

**Market Share Reality Check**

Despite rapid growth in recent years, EVs remain a **niche segment** in the U.S.



* **2025 Forecast**: 8.5% of total new car sales (revised down from 10% after the budget changes)
* **2023**: 7.6% market share
* **2022**: 5.9% market share



The U.S. trails both **China**, where new energy vehicles (NEVs) account for over **50%** of passenger car sales, and the **European Union**, where battery electric vehicles (BEVs) hold a **15.6%** share.

 **Winners and Losers in the New Landscape**

 **Likely Beneficiaries – Hybrids & Plug-In Hybrids** With cost competitiveness and minimal reliance on charging infrastructure, hybrids are emerging as the short-term winners. Honda has already canceled its planned large EV SUVs to focus on hybrids, and Nissan has shifted resources away from future EV sedans toward SUVs.

**Potential Losers – High-Cost EV Segments** Without subsidies, premium EVs face a tougher road. Tesla’s market dominance continues, but even it faces pressure from rising competition and declining consumer price tolerance.

**Companies Staying the Course**



* **Ford**: Pushing ahead with EV plans, including affordable releases, but delaying some models until 2028.
* **Rivian**: Launching its R2 in early 2026, followed by R3 models.
* **Hyundai/Kia/Genesis**: Expanding EV capacity at its $7.6B Georgia plant, targeting 500,000 EVs and hybrids annually.



 

 **A Strategic Turning Point**

The U.S. market is shifting from **policy-driven adoption** to **consumer-driven growth**. This transition will test automakers’ ability to:



1. **Price competitively** without subsidies.
2. **Market effectively** to a broader audience.
3. **Deliver compelling technology and reliability** at scale.



The Rhodium Group warns that without policy support, the number of EVs on American roads by 2035 could be **significantly lower** than previous projections—widening the gap with global leaders.

**Global Competitive Pressure**

While U.S. automakers recalibrate, China continues its EV dominance with **5.47 million NEV sales in H1 2025**. Chinese brands like BYD are winning on affordability, battery innovation, and advanced in-car technology. The EU’s steady growth in BEV share also highlights the U.S.’s relatively slow transition pace.

**Implications for India**

India’s EV sector is still at an early adoption stage (less than 2% penetration in passenger cars), but the U.S. policy shift offers three lessons:



1. **Don’t Over-Rely on Incentives** – Build cost competitiveness so demand can sustain even if subsidies are reduced.
2. **Target Export Niches** – Affordable, mid-range EVs could find buyers in markets where U.S./EU prices rise due to policy and tariff shifts.
3. **Strengthen Supply Chain Independence** – Reduce vulnerability to imported battery materials that could face price volatility.



**RACE Auto India Viewpoint**

The U.S. EV market is moving from a **policy-driven** to an **organic growth** phase — a painful but potentially necessary transition. For India, this is a chance to:



* Position as a **cost leader** in EV manufacturing.
* Develop **flexible platforms** for domestic and export markets.
* Accelerate charging infrastructure to build consumer confidence.



While the U.S. cools, India could warm up — provided the industry avoids over-reliance on government subsidies and focuses on value-driven innovation.

1mq48qo,2018 Honda fit Lx. Trying to transcribe what mechanic is saying," This is a transcription of an audio from someone with a heavy accent. He is telling me something that was wrong with my car but its been a minute and I am car illiterate so I'm not sure what hes saying becauseof that plus the accent. For context, when I would turn my car on for the first minute, give or take, the display would short out and look jumbled or just not be there completely, but eventually would come back on. It seemed to happen more so in the cold rather than anything else and would stop as soon as the car warmed up. I'm trying to figure out what this guy actually said. 

This is what chatgpt said but what do you think?


From the transcript and your description of the symptoms, it sounds like the person was trying to explain that there’s an issue with the car’s control module—likely the instrument cluster or a related communication module—that’s affecting your gauge display (fuel gauge, odometer, and possibly the entire dashboard display).

Here’s my best interpretation of what they meant, simplified:

1. Problem source
There’s a communication problem between the control module and the rest of the system. The “old control module” isn’t properly talking to other parts, which causes your display to go blank or jumbled for a short while after starting.


2. Repair process
To fix it, the module would need to be replaced. This isn’t something every shop can do—it often requires a dealer because they have to install and program the new module so that it works with your specific car, including transferring the mileage (odometer reading) and other stored information into the new one.


3. Cost vs urgency
He said it will cost money to replace, but the only real “inconvenience” right now is that you can’t see your fuel gauge or other readings while the display is out. It won’t cause your vehicle to shut down or leave you stranded.
Because of that, you can delay the repair if you want—especially if you’re trying to avoid the expense for now.


4. Safety note
The only real risk is misjudging fuel level or missing other warnings while the screen is off. Otherwise, the car should still run fine.



If I rephrase what he was getting at in plain English, it might be:
""Your control module for the gauges is starting to fail. The dealer would have to replace it and program the new one with your car’s mileage and settings. It’s not urgent—your car will still run—but your gauges might be wrong or not show up for a bit when starting, especially in cold weather. You can put off the repair if you need to.""

If you want, I can also try to rewrite his exact transcript into a cleaned-up, natural-sounding version of what he likely meant. That would make it much easier to follow.

I try to start it and nothing happens. I remember the car is still in drive. I put it in park. Fully then it off (dash lights were still on before this). Try to start it. It’s turning and trying to start, but won’t. Was making the sound between turning a meet and the engineer fully running. I have to hit the push start again to stop it and turn it off. Tried that many times. Same thing over and over. With the push button start, you need to keep your foot on the brake for the car to start.  I randomly decided to take my foot off the brake while it’s trying to start and it starts up!  Drive home fine.  I have noticed recently there seems to be a bit of a lag when moving at slow speeds and try to accelerate(10mph to 35mph for example).  

Oh, also, it engaged the e-brake when it shut off and I was kind of panicking thinking I couldn’t even push the car if I wanted to.  Couldn’t disengage the e-brake until it finally started. 

I have no idea what or why it happened. Any input from anyone that might know?  I scared of driving on the highway and the same thing happens and the e-brake engages while doing 65.

Given that it only happens as you brake, it may be that you just have worn brake pads and it’s time to change your brakes. It sucks if you have to take it to a shop but it’s that or eventually no more brakes stopping your car lol.  

Given that you can “feel” the difference in the pedal but the brakes aren’t squeeeeeeeling, they are almost for sure bad brakes but not a “you need to panic” kind of bad. It will be a “you need to panic” if you don’t get them fixed though.

If you noticed the noise happening as you accelerate or are going 30-50mph, then perhaps it is the wheel bearings. Since you feel it in the pedal though, I highly doubt that.

TLDR: go get your brakes done by a reputable shop and you’ll probs be good to gk"

I’m driving a rental Toyota Corolla from an autobody shop after my car was totaled. While moving a mini-fridge, the guy helping me accidentally shoved it against the dashboard. Now there’s a small dent/warp in the leatherette — not deep enough to damage the plastic underneath, just cosmetic.

Is $5500-$5700 an appropriate quote to repair my 2015 Subaru Impreza sport hatchback? They said they need to replace the radiator, fender, headlights, and bumper. They said they would buy it from me for $1500 if I didn’t want to do the repairs, yet I just finished paying off this car 2 months ago (I spent $13k on it). It has 120k miles currently.

Please don’t harp on me for this. Yesterday I rear ended someone. We’re both okay. The guy started to go then came to a sharp stop. Doesn’t matter if I think we’re equally at fault because in the end, I hit him. This isn’t covered under my insurance (stupid me only had comprehensive, not collision - I didn’t realize that) so I have to pay out of pocket for repairs…

I took my car to a local shop that I’ve been to before without issue. Right next door to them is a body shop, which I found convenient, hoping to get this done soon.

I told him the situation and he says no problem he’ll give me a quote after him and the body shop look at it. He called me today to say it’ll cost between $5500-$5700 to fix, looking like nothing ever happened. 

I asked him if this is what it would cost without it looking like nothing happened (cosmetically) and he said no, if I only focused on the mechanical repairs it would be $1k cheaper. So I tell him I’m not concerned with how it looks, just that it’s safe to drive, because I really don’t have the extra cash right now. 

Then he tells me “well the guy at the body shop wouldn’t like to do that because he’s proud of his work and wouldn’t want someone seeing your car, hearing it was from his shop, and having it look less than perfect.” I told him I would have to think about this because it’s a lot of money, then he proceeded to say “well just ask your boyfriend to fork over some money, that’s what a partnership is. You’ll figure it out. You can always take out a bank loan.”

Well he doesn’t know I’m even dating anyone, and I felt this was distasteful and rude. I cannot afford these repairs. I don’t want to take out a loan. Obviously I’ll have to borrow money from someone if it exceeds a certain amount, but I feel like this is.. grimy.. for reference I’m a 30 year old woman.

Most shops are not going to be willing to do this. Most of the external damage in the photos you provided would need to be replaced in order to pass a safety inspection. A shop also wanting work to look complete is a valid complaint as well, since its only slightly more work to redo everything instead bits and pieces + yes they want their work to be seen as good.  The price he's given you is probably fair given what all I can see. 

As far as his comment about your nonexistent boyfriend, there's no accounting for taste, but most mechanics do default to wanting to deal with men in explaining what needs to be done to fix something. Yes its a bit misogynistic, but in stereotypical sense men are more likely to understand the ins and outs of cars, and you balking at the price (cars are fucking expensive these day it is what it is)  is probably something he unfortunately deals with way too often. Is he an asshole? Maybe, but you're always welcome to get another shop to look at it and give you another estimate.

1mqc958,Can a faulty ECM cause engine problems?,"I'm embarassed to have to ask this but I am not a car guy so not totally aware of what and how car parts work. But recently my car broke down. Supposedly from some sort of engine failure. It was a used 2005 with quite a lot of miles on it.

Initial diagnosis points to both a faulty injector and a need to rebuild or replace the engine. Car starts, idles rough, 1 cylinder not working and wouldn't move pushing the pedal. No issues with fuel pump, overheating or the radiator liquid bursting like I've seen happen in some other faulty cars.

Got a second opinion and the injectors are fine? Guy swapped the ""faulty"" one into the other cylinder and it works. The good one into the previous cylinder and that one doesn't work again. So the injectors are supposedly fine but that one cylinder isn't.

Got a third opinion and the guy does a compression test. All cylinders have ~200 units of whatever so that indicates the engine is likely still ok?

This is the new discovery and part that I'm way too unsure of. The guy found out by tracing it back that the injectors... aren't receiving signals or voltage from the ECM? So they are suspecting that possibly its a faulty ECM that needs a repair or replacement. Is that even a thing? I'm confused by this the most.

Thankfully diagnosis is free for all of this and the last guy is currently taking the ECM in for further diagnosis and possible repair. I don't know if I should have my hopes up.

Its a New England car so some rust is expected. Also fyi I have some mechanic aptitude and plan on changing fluids/filters myself but the bigger stuff I'll take to my mechanic. 

The main issues on the repair list (see pics) - front brakes and rotors, front suspension, exhaust connection w/ muffler rusting, possible AC compressor leak, and occasional CEL with p0446 code which is an evap control issue. Spark plugs and coolant were changed at 130k.

My initial plan is to replace the front brakes and rotors as well as fluids like engine oil, coolant, and possibly transmission oil. The front suspension definitely doesn't look great but they aren't leaking yet so I figure I wait on those until they do. The p0446 I'll try to see if a new fuel cap fixes since it looks like the original cap is still there - if it doesn't fix it i would rather keep driving until inspection next year and fix if it fails emissions since I've read it can be a crapshoot to diagnose. 

The AC still works despite the apparent leak, but its not something I want to replace if possible since its so expensive. If I did need to replace would there be harm in leaving it besides not having AC? It doesn't seem connected to other engine parts with belts like other cars.

Or not.  

The reading I'm doing on the internets isn't matching up to some things and there feels like this missing gap I'm trying to fill in with someone who really understands this type of engine.  It's a 2015 Mazda CX5 if that matters. 

Long story short....had that cleaning done at Valvoline, the next time I started my car it was f-ed.  Independent mechanic agreed it was likely due to cleaning, but I don't feel like his argument is strong enough in court.  

Valvoline has a specific process for GDI engines that they did NOT do, and the store manager claim they've never heard of that or any issue of doing their normal process on a DI engine.  My mechanic also says if done right it shouldn't be an issue. 

My argument is that there are clearly very specific processes and cleanings for GDI engines from both the manufacturer and Valvoline.  

But my mechanic doesn't seem to think this is a good argument, and neither does Valvoline, and I don't understand why it isn't. Or if they are both just unaware. 

To me (I'm in the health profession) it seems like the equivalent of doing a perfect technical blood transfusion, but you used the wrong type of blood.  It doesn't matter that you did it ""right"", it was contraindicated.  Even if you've gotten away with not checking. 

To me this seems like potentially a much larger class action issue if Valvoline is regularly doing these cleaning on DI engines that (according to my limited knowledge) really are intended for port engines.

Either it is A. Harmless, but not doing the promised cleaning...and my car was a total fluke/coincidence (hard to believe with the timing of events)

Or

B. Usually harmless, not doing the intended cleaning and carries a lot of risks

I'm in a bit of a bind and could use some advice on a temporary fix for my car. After sorting out a lot of problems from the previous owner, the car is running well, but its low-mounted aftermarket cold air intake is causing a serious issue. Hitting any water-filled pothole causes the intake to suck in water, which stalls the engine.

I have to leave the state for work in about a week, and with a rainy forecast, I need a reliable, quick solution to prevent this from happening. My main idea is to create a DIY splash guard, but I'm open to other temporary alternatives.

What's the best cheap route for a splash guard, or are there any other quick and effective fixes you'd recommend to keep the car from ingesting water until I can get a proper replacement intake?

1mpu0w1,Surconso essence 1.2L Puretech,"Bonjour à tous,

Je constate, depuis environ un mois et demi, une surconsommation d’essence sur ma Citroën C3 Aircross (90 000 km). Jusqu’à présent, ma consommation moyenne était d’environ 6 L/100 km. Or, depuis juin, elle est passée à 6,4 L/100 km, et aujourd’hui, en août, elle atteint 7,8 L/100 km.

Quelques précisions :
- Le moteur n’a jamais posé de problème, et je n’ai jamais remarqué de surconsommation d’huile.
- La courroie a été changée à 80 000 km, et je fais systématiquement la vidange ainsi que le changement des filtres chaque année.
- Chaque année, ni l’huile ni le bouchon de vidange ne présentent de dépôts métalliques.

La surconsommation a commencé fin juin, ce qui m’amène à douter que la révision de juillet en soit la cause (vidange, filtres à huile et à air, bougies, disques et plaquettes de frein arrière, vidange du liquide de frein). D’autant plus qu’une des bougies était totalement desserrée lors du démontage des anciennes. J’avais alors pensé que le problème venait de cette bougie, entraînant une perte de compression.

Pourtant, malgré la révision, la consommation d’essence n’a cessé d’augmenter pour atteindre 7,8 L/100 km aujourd’hui. Je n’ai détecté aucune fuite sous la voiture, que ce soit moteur éteint ou en marche, ni sous le capot. J’ai déjà eu des souris qui ont rongé la mousse isolante au-dessus du moteur, sous le tableau de bord, ce qui m’a fait penser à un câble endommagé. Mais à première vue, tout semble en ordre.

Avez-vous une idée de l’origine de ce problème ? Malgré une conduite encore plus souple qu’à l’accoutumée, la consommation continue de grimper.",2,1755157280.0,5,AskMechanics,1755286574,2025-08-14 07:41:20,2025-08-15 19:36:14,"clemdu45 (Score: 1): Chaleur très élevée = combustion moins efficace

1mpqh81,"Mustang Alternator amp Question: 130, 170, 105???","2003 Ford Mustang GT. 

Question Up Front: 
Is getting a higher amp alternator bad for the battery?

Backstory:
In the past, it had an issue where the car would die if I didn't notice the battery gauge going low. Revving the car would fix it, but it died a couple times when I didn't notice it. We figured it was a bad alternator. 

The fix? Instead of the 110 amp AutoZone alternator I replaced 3 times over the span of a year, I got a 170 amp one online. Didn't have the dying problem again, though it still didn't like being turned on without the engine being on. That one lasted 4 years because...

Today's Issue/Question:
Fast forward to today. Battery light came on.  Battery (9 months old) died in O'Reilly's parking lot. Test says bad battery.  Replaced battery. Second test said bad alternator. O'Reilly's guy insists the 170 amp alternator had something to do with killing the battery early, so suggests buying the 105 amp one they sell. 

His explanation made sense, something along the lines of the car specific batteries are designed for specific amps, and too many amps can be bad. Related it to a higher volt battery in something not calling for it can mess up the appliance. 

I'm concerned because a 110 amp alternator didn't fix the old ""car randomly dying"" issue, so 5 fewer amps would just exaserbate that?

I guess the question is will a higher amp alternator be bad?",1,1755145203.0,3,AskMechanics,1755286574,2025-08-14 04:20:03,2025-08-15 19:36:14,Ravenblack67 (Score: 1): The alternator output is controlled by the ECU and the battery sense system.

So 4ish months ago I replaced my bad starter with a reconditioned one and I had a guy do the labor for me. He was great, but there was a language barrier. After replacing he told me the flex plate teeth were dull and that I’d need to replace that next (mostly using hands to describe this). For the next four months I saved up so I could take my car to a real shop because my car would take many MANY turns to start. I was a bit worried it was the reconditioned starter so I figured a shop would be able to diagnose it better. I found a shop that quoted me $1500 to replace the flex plate and figured they would do a good job. 

I picked up my car today and my check engine light was on and the mechanic didn’t say anything about it. I parked my car and went back in and talked to them and the mechanic said he plugged in the obd2 and there was no code. I told them if it didn’t turn off I’d be back. 

Would a sensor (like a knock sensor right next to the starter) be disconnected and that cause a light to be on and no code?

before it was throwing multiple o2 codes (bank 1 sensor 2 or something like that) and an evap circuit code. i plugged up some loose plug underneath the car (near the cat) which i assumed was something related to the o2 codes. i can’t be for certain because a dumbass (me) accidentally deleted all the codes 😬 but i regularly check the codes and the only codes now is the evap code. 

now… my current problem. when the ignition is in the “on” position, my break, battery, and airbag light all come on. as you can see in the image. when i start the car they’ll turn off but will turn back after after a few moments with a weird “whirring” or “buzzing” sound coming from the dash near the ignition switch? my break light would come on every now and then but this was after a mechanic checked it out and played around with my breaks to check them. i’ve noticed if i let off the gas long enough the rpm, essentially the entire car, will just… turn off and back on? the engine won’t shut off but everything else seems to shut off then start up again.

Had to tow it to a shop (the towing guy tried to jump start and didn’t work, he also suggested probably the starter is faulty)and they said Starter was faulty and they’ll have to replace it but they didn’t have the parts, so I had to wait till Monday. On Monday, I get a call from them in the morning giving me a quote for the replacement and said the car will be ready by the evening. Then I called them back asking if they are putting an OEM part or an Aftermarket, and they said, they will be rebuilding the same part, I was like you just told me you will be replacing the part.
The guy acted a little rude and said this is what we will be doing, I was like alright, I need the car desperately, so whatever. And then I picked by the car in the evening. But they wouldn’t talk to me straight and acted shady, I asked about the warranty and now they changed again. Previously they said, it would be 3 years, now they were like it will be 1 year only. And if I do something like Uber (which I do), it will be 3 months only.
I was furious, because these mfs kept changing shit and now this, and I paid $650 for all this.

Fast forward today (just after 2 days), my car wouldn’t start again at an apartment complex. Another delivery driver was nice enough to give me a jumpstart and the car started.

1mpogqc,Clunk sound when depressing clutch,"2007 Mazda 3 2.3L 5 speed. 

I am experiencing a clunk noise when I put my car in 1st gear and let off the clutch. I also hear the noise when going from 1st to 2nd gear and let off the clutch. In neutral the clunk does not happen when I let off the clutch so the sounds only happens under load. Shifting to 3rd, 4th and 5th gear does not produce the noise. 

Some context, the noise started a few months into 2025. In November of 2024 I replaced my rear transmission mount with an OEM one that I bought off eBay. In May 20205 I replaced my clutch due to a leaking rear main seal. I was hoping that the clunk would go away but it was still present. While replacing my rear main seal I inspect my motor mounts and discovered that both passenger and top transmission mounts were cracked. I didn't replace those mounts until 2 weeks ago. Now, I really had hoped the clunk would go away but no, still there. 

Today I inspect the rear motor mount and discovered that it does have a lot of play when I put my car into 1st gear and let off the clutch pedal. I will include a short video. You can hear the clunk noise in the video. Physically  the rear mount appears to be in great condition but it moves a lot. Is it possible for the rear mount to go bad in such a short time? Maybe it failed prematurely because the other two mounts were bad? Let me know your thoughts!

1mpudnn,Is it just me or is warranty work becoming the absolute worst part of this job?,"Hey everyone,

Sorry if this is a common rant here, but I just opened my own independent shop a few months ago and I'm honestly struggling to get my head around the warranty claims process.

It feels like a full-time job just to get paid for work I've already done. I fix the car, the customer is happy, and then I spend the next week playing telephone between the parts supplier and the OEM, filling out endless forms, and half the time, feeling like they're just looking for a reason to deny the claim. It's incredibly frustrating, and as a new business, I can't afford to just eat these costs.

I have to ask, how are you all managing this? Are there any particular software or systems you use that actually help streamline this, or is everyone just stuck in a mess of paperwork and angry phone calls?

1mqf6j4,"Moving between Oakham, England and Berlin, Germany - Car Options?","Hi all,

I currently live in Oakham and have found an opportunity in Berlin

I'll be spending about 150 days a year out there, in 75 day stretches, with two return journeys back and fourth from Oakham to Berlin, about 1250km each way.

I am a complete novice when it comes to cars, so here I am, asking for some advice from the community that knows best:

1 - When in Berlin, I am a city driver, often limited to speeds of around 50kmph

2 - When in Berlin, I'm likely to be driving around 100km a day in the city

3 - When I am on the autobahn, I find myself driving at around 160-180kmph, so stability and durability matter to me

4 - I care about fuel economy, but not to the point that I would downgrade my comfort for it

5 - I will be spending a lot of time in my cabin, so enjoy having features such as cruise control, android play, parking assistance and good integrated speaker systems

6 - Choosing between petrol, diesel, hybrid and electric is incredibly difficult - personally, I want to stay away from electric due to range anxiety.

Petrol is around 1.70EUR a litre in Berlin, Diesel is around 1.57EUR a litre - I've been advised to ignore that, given that diesel is not suitable for city driving to the level that I am doing and could end up costing me more money in parts if I'm not on the motorway enough - is this true?

So... with all of that, what should I be looking at in terms of car options?

i've been advised to go with a Toyota Prius, but that's just one suggestion.

Not interested in renting for a number of reasons - mainly because I've been shafted twice by two separate rental companies whilst in Germany, Avis and Hertz, so - what are the suggestions?

New insurer would be pointing at Esure, who would probably point straight back at them!




And if one (or both) paid out, who should they pay? The policyholder? The owner?

1mq724v,Intermittent Knocking Noise - Only Happens on Acceleration,"I own a 2007 VW Polo 1.2. The car has been fine since I've owned it.

On Tuesday this week whilst on a long 80 mile journey, at about 70 miles into the journey on the way there after I got off the motorway and onto some A roads, the car suddenly started making a little ticking/tapping noise coming from the front of the car, a little metallic-like noise, tap, tap tap, recurring very very quickly, almost as quickly as the wheels spin on the car it feels, not sure if it's quite that quick but it feels like it is, it's a very quick repeating tapping noise. This makes me feel it's something linked to the wheels, but keep reading. 

Key point: the noise only happens when I put my foot on the accelerator, and completely goes away altogether when I take my foot off the accelerator. But it eventually went away on it's own and I was able to complete my journey without really giving it a second thought. I forgot all about it. 

The next day (yesterday) I completed another much smaller journey to another office and this didn't crop up at all.

This morning I embarked on another long motorway journey. I got on the motorway and about 20 miles in, it started happening again. A really fast paced tapping noise. Only this time it began to get alot worse much quicker. This is definitely linked to the both speed of the car and the amount of press I give the accelerator. Again it completely disappears when I take my foot off the accelerator, but it gets worse the faster I try to go when my foot is pressed on the accelerator. If I press my foot on the accelerator harder, the noise gets louder, and if I really put my foot down, the noise turns into a much louder banging noise which you can also then feel through the accelerator pedal, and it feels so dangerous that if I don't take my foot off the accelerator something is either going to break or snap. Something stationary is definitely hitting something rotational. It felt almost like the front wheel could be falling off. So I stopped on the hard shoulder and checked the front right wheel bolts were secured tight using my breaker bar, and they were indeed secure. I set off again but this became unbearable because I couldn't maintain a fast enough speed on the motorway to keep going without having this banging noise going on getting worse whatever it is I had no choice but to turn back around and nurse the car back home NOT on the motorway. Then when I got off the motorway, I went over some speed bumps and the issue suddenly disappeared completely again, and did not reoccur at all for the rest of the entire journey back home. And now the car is acting like there's nothing wrong agian. But something is definitely wrong with it. It feels like something is being knocked out of place hitting something linked to the acceleration, that is getting bumped back into place again when the car bumps over some uneven section of road. If I slow the car down to about 35 miles an hour or less, this also alleviates it. The A roads on the journey I mentioned on Tuesday were a bit bumpy in places, which is where it began. But this morning it started happening on the motorway, a less bumpy ride.

Car 1: bought in UK (Scotland) and exported to ROI in 2017.

Car 2: bought in NI and exported to ROI in 2024.

We own both cars and have done since buying them.

1) Under ""supplier"", which can't be skipped, what do I put down? These are our cars which we're bringing with us, not cars that we're buying outside NI and importing. I don't want to accidentally make us liable for customs duties or taxes that ought not to be relevant. I've tried ringing HMRC but the number I got is no longer operable and I am directed to the website instead.

53,006 miles | Petrol | Manual
	2.	£7,590 – 2014 Mercedes-Benz CLA 180 AMG Sport
97,500 miles | Petrol | Manual
	3.	£6,395 – 2015 Honda Civic 1.8 i-VTEC SR Hatchback
98,000 miles | Petrol | Manual

My current car:
2015 Honda Civic 1.6 i-DTEC diesel (116,000 miles). Great car, but the DPF keeps getting blocked because I don’t do enough long journeys.

What I want: petrol engine, reliable daily driver, not ruinous to run, and a bit of style would be nice.

	•	Which one would you go for?
	•	Which would you avoid at all costs and why?

Still not driving in the UK legally. Given that the Eurotunnel runs 24hrs a day I'm failing to see why it isn't possible for you to drive back and have a MOT on the same day, or at least as part of a single continuous journey.

Fast forward to July this year the engine and electronics just cut out whilst driving on the dual carraige way on the way home from work. Pulled in to a layby, car can start but load tapping noise now, oil levels okay. No codes. I got recovered home by the RAC. 

I contacted the mechanic who carried out the rebuild that evening and he said he would call back the next day but will be away from the business for 2 weeks (assuming summer holiday). Fast word to now, 4 weeks later and despite multiple chases and calls ive not heard anything back. 

I had a diesel specialist do a diagnosis this week and he states that the issue will be bottom end. Suggest I talk to the original mechanic.  Many other garages suggest the same under warranty.

It’s always bemused me that they’re the only firm to give this sort of warranty. When you’re spending tens of thousands on a product, the least they can do is honour it with decent coverage.

The ones i find on the used market where i live usually have the 1.4l 73hp engine (i think the engine is from the TU3 engine family). I’ve done a bit of research, and some say they’re not great since they have headgasket issues, while other say it’s one of Citroën better engines. Also, an aquintance of mine drove a vehicle with the 1.4l TU3 and abused it like mad and it never failed or blew a headgasket, so im not sure how prominent it is? Does anyone have experience with these and know how good the reliability of the engine and of these vehicles are?

Obviously all these things will depend on how the vehicle was maintained, but with a decent service history, would it be a good used car?

Why im interested in them is because they’re cheap, lots of examples with low mileage where i live on the used market and they get exceptional gas mileage.

Yes, head gaskets *can* be a problem in the TU3s but it’s also one of PSA’s (as it was then) better engines too. Both things are true! Haha

The interiors on these can also wear quite badly and the front seats lack thigh support. The 1.4 is ok around town but a bit gutless above 45, 50mph — the 1.6 is a bit better in that regard. Actually the 1.1 isn’t total dogshit if it’s just a town runabout.

Also parts — outside of engine parts — might start to become difficult to get, with the oldest of these cars now being almost 25 years old.

Bear in mind that the second-gen C3 has been subject to a major ‘stop drive’ recall notice for airbag safety issues, so if you’re looking at those make sure the car has been through its recall process and the fault addressed."
