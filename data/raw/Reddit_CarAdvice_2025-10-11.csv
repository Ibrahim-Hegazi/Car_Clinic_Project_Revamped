1o3dvy8,Is it worth repairing my vehicle? Or should I just trade it in for some money and get something else.,"Hello,

I drive a 2008 Mazda CX-9 Grand Touring AWD (3.7L V6)  
\- I do regular oil changes every 5k miles (Full synthetic high mileage oil)  
\- It is my daily driver, and it is used for mixed city/highway use.  
\- I would need to take a loan whether I repair or replace it.  
\- The vehicle has \~124,400 miles on the odometer.

I have the goal to keep the vehicle for at least another 4 or 5 years.

Recently, I heard a snap from the Driver's front side. A reputable local shop inspected it and found the following:  
\- All motor and transmission mounts are worn out and cracking.  
\- Possible torque converter issues in the transmission (Needs specialized testing, I have a scheduled appointment with a local transmission shop.)  
\- Transmission fluid is burnt and was overfilled.  
\- Rear driveshaft carrier has play.  
\- Slight corrosion on rear brake rotors.  
\- The battery is sweating.

The shop quoted me $3,023.78 for all of these repairs excluding the transmission (and replacing the spark plugs, since it is time for that).  
The scheduled appointment for the transmission inspection is on Wednesday (it is Friday as of the time of writing this), and from a quick google search, a transmission replacement could cost around $6,000 (worst case scenario).

In addition, there are some other (minor) issues that I have had for awhile, or stuff that is upcoming:  
\- Driver AC blows warm, Passenger AC blows moderately cool, and the rear gets very cold.  
\- The rubber part of the wheels only have \~6 months of life left.  
\- It chugs fuel like a frat guy with the whole keg.  
\- It needs it's general maintenance done still, and is due for multiple fluid flushes in 5k miles.

I have a pro-con list for both keeping and ridding it.  
Pros (keeping)  
\- I already know the vehicle's history and current issues.  
\- No need to deal with car shopping, paperwork, or taxes.  
\- Insurance rates would stay low.  
\- Once the drivetrain repairs are complete, it could run reliably for a few more years  
\- I am comfortable driving it (I have a very tall torso, so I don't fit in most vehicles.)  
\- I know its little quirks.  
\- It is environmentally better to repair than replace

Cons:  
\- The repair costs are several times the car's total value.  
\- Still an older vehicle, so other components could fail soon after repairs.  
\- Transmission work is still a big unknown, and might not fix all of the issues.  
\- Resale value is still very low.  
\- Chugs fuel

Pros (Replacing)  
\- Chance to reset the clock with something a little newer.  
\- Better fuel economy,  
\- Fewer immediate major repairs.

Cons (Replacing):  
\- Still need to take out a loan  
\- Buying a cheaper used car comes with risks  
\- Taxes, Registration, and insurance could cost more.  
\- Finding a solid vehicle can take some time.  
\- May still need minor repairs or maintenance right after purchasing.  
\- I will be very sad to see the CX-9 go.",1,1760132387.0,11,MechanicAdvice,1760211178,2025-10-10 21:39:47,2025-10-11 19:32:58,"Greedy-Recognition74 (Score: 1): How many miles on it?

Anyone able to help me out here? It ran before I changed the plugs and wires.

Before it was:

Back

3    6

8    7

2    1

Back

4    5

Front

In other words, the 4 and 2 cylinders are swapped and the 6 and 8 are swapped.

Now I‚Äôm getting this popping sound. The reason I changed it was since I was running VERY rich. I‚Äôm talking 2 gallons in 5 minutes. Despite turning my Holley 4160s fuel and air ratio screws to the leanest.

Fast forward to yesterday, the driver side front wheel is covered in transmission fluid, as is the lower control arm and most parts on the driver side. Which lead me to believe the same seal broke again.

However upon taking out the axle and examining the location that meets the seal, it doesn't seem damaged to me, it still feels smooth but I'm not sure if what I think looks like normal wear is actually worn out so I included photos.

Do I need to replace this seal and axle again? If so, any tips on how to avoid this in the future?

If this looks like it's in good shape, what are some possible culprits for the leak?

Thanks!

Since its paid off and a decent car I mean this thing is like held together by I guess pure spite. its in great condition really, but the air conditioning has been dead for a few years. My parents Only explanation when asked whats wrong with it when they had a pro look into it is that the system is ""Swiss Cheese"" and that it would be 1000$ in labor to get it fixed, and since I usually can and will fix my own car problems myself I figured I'd try, but im horrible at diagnosing and too stubborn to have some shop take a look especially if its gonna end up being one of those jobs that is more trouble than its worth. 

So, when the air is turned on it just blows hot air and in winter the heater will eventually heat up but i feel its more based on the engine heat. Im already looking into replacing the heater core, ive been able to find guides and diagrams for that but since theres alot of components to the cooling system I wanna hear what you guys think might be going on, would this be worth the hassle to get the comfort of Cold Air and stop needing to roll the windows down in summer. Could you guys find me some decent diagrams or guides to the location of the AC parts. could this be as simple as replacing the condenser or does the definition of ""Swiss Cheese"" point to leaky hoses that require replacement.

1o2tz55,Splash shield? Issues Mid-Roadtrip,"TLDR: Can I just zip tie it for the next few weeks?

2021 Honda CR-V (driven across the country every handful of weeks for the last year - so a LOT of road time and miles)

Context: We were driving down the interstate when we hard a nice little scraping sound. Pulled over and found that this was hanging down on the front of the car. 

Assessment? (But by someone who has no idea what they're doing): Unfortunately I am not super familiar with the parts of a car, but from what I've been able to find online, I believe this is the splash shield? The pins or bolts that held it in place (plastic to metal to undercarriage) along the outside edge are missing in that corner. Besides that, all parts of the plastic are in-tact but the metal is bent/curled a bit in that corner. However, even bent at the front, the metal part tucks up nicely behind the plastic and everything fits in place and is all but flush from an external view when I hold it up to the car.

Thoughts: I had similar-ish issues to this with my first car and they no longer made the pins for it so I just carried zip ties and duct tape in my car (as recommended by my mechanic) and it worked just fine like that for a good number of years. Was still running well when I traded it in even.

Concerns: However, it never had any bent metal pieces so I am not sure how much that changes things. The rest of our drive takes us all through the mountains where there is of course often no room to pull over and very little in terms of easily accessible assistance or supplies.

Question: Would it be relatively/reasonably safe to just use zip ties to hold it together for the rest of our trip that involves extensive periods of driving?",1,1760079615.0,5,MechanicAdvice,1760211178,2025-10-10 07:00:15,2025-10-11 19:32:58,"anonymousdruglover (Score: 2): Zip ties will be fine.

So I read many of the coolant flush topics, the risks and subtleties... Just dumping a summary for feedback.
I have a 2019 VW Touran 1.5 TSI with now around 105 000km. 
I don't think we ever did a coolant replacement. If a dealer claim they did, I highly suspect they would have lied and simply top up the fluid (as usual...).

In any case VW recommended now g12 evo which is newer than g12++ or g13 (on most recent engines, which seems mine included in their inaccurate comment). They also recommend a flush when swapping coolant generation.

So I intend to do it myself:
-First Maybe its not necessary to go for g12 evo but I don't mind as probably have to replace the coolant anyway
-Collant not visibly deteriorated its still visibly pinkinsh purplish but hard to say in the coolant top reservoir...Anyway its not that young probably.
-is that possible that I would need 6-7 liters of coolant? Seems a lot but apparently that's my engine reservoir size from my quick initial research...
-I'll probably used the distilled water method to flush several times...
-Do I risk running into rust displacement issue or its relatively recent and should have not rusted?
-What about air bubbles, I saw someone using some sort of tool to prevent that? I was just thinking or removing radiator pipe below the engine and let gravity does its job...
- I was initially considering using a flush product like K2 RADIATOR FLUSH T220 - FLUSH FOR RADIATOR 400 ML REMOVES IMPURITIES... I know some could be aggressive for heat gasket, but if its used briefly and then other flushes made with distilled water it should be fine in my context no? I mean 6 years should not have so many rust or impurities?

- Finally im also wondering about the radiator lower pipe or opening itself... What if its rusty or damaged, anything to replace? For example when replacing oil I replace the screw and joint always...

I tell him nah, I‚Äôd rather not do trade backs since we already agreed to trade as is and neither of us test drove the vehicles beforehand.  He keeps nagging at me until I eventually block him. I feel like an asshole but that‚Äôs besides the point. 

Later I‚Äôm outside in my driveway and I see him walking down my street. I assume he got my adress from the title. I drive around the corner and call the police because I know this isn‚Äôt going to be pretty if we start having an argument. The dispatcher tells me he‚Äôs also contacted them. 

An officer shows up and he basically says he can‚Äôt do anything, since we made an agreement it‚Äôs a civil matter. He can sue me if he‚Äôd like but it‚Äôs not a police matter. 

What can this guy possibly do? Am I in the wrong here? Would I be forced to return the car if he eventually does take me to court or would a judge just throw this out? It seems ridiculous but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm legally required to disclose any issues with the car.

1o2ocrj,2001 Pontiac Grand Am Engine randomly shutting off while driving,"Hi everyone,
I just want to say I don't know much about cars.

To start, quite often when I start my car and shift into reverse ‚Äî and more recently drive ‚Äî the engine just turns off. It doesn‚Äôt always happen, but it‚Äôs fairly common. I‚Äôll just restart it, and sometimes it happens multiple times. Annoying, but not a huge deal.

The real issue is when the engine turns off randomly while driving, which can be extremely dangerous as the power steering also stops working. Usually, after putting it in park and restarting, it will start back up with no problem. There is seemingly no warning when it happens ‚Äî it appears to be random. It also seems to be getting more consistent. Just today, it happened: I restarted the car, it started up fine, and the second I put it into drive, the engine turned off. It happened three times before finally staying on.

I have replaced the fuel pump, fuel pump filter, fuel pump relay switch, and most recently took it into a shop. They said the catalytic converter was clogged, so I got it replaced, hoping the issue would be fixed ‚Äî but alas, it‚Äôs still there. There are no engine codes or anything apparent.

All the things I‚Äôve replaced were to try to fix the issue, so before throwing more money at it, I figured I‚Äôd ask for advice here. Sorry for the long post ‚Äî I‚Äôm just trying to give as much information as possible since the problem is intermittent. Any help is appreciated.

I got a Mazda CX-5 2018 Sport in summer 2024 - hardly any miles on it and ran well. I've kept basic maintenance on it, tires, oil, etc. I haven't had to change anything ""big"" on it and ironically, this happened the week that I was planning on getting a better inspection to be better aware.

This past week the battery died, and I got it serviced. AAA technician informed me the car had the wrong battery in it - MT-34 Interstate Battery, when it should have a 35. Unless the technician is lying to me and a 34 is okay for my vehicle.... He showed me that the locking mechanisms were barely holding the battery in place and it was probably jamming around in there, especially since I take the highway about 4 times a week for travel. 

I looked at my CarFax, and it was interesting that during the three years it was at the original dealership, almost every 5-7 months there was a battery check. The last battery check was 2021. before another person bought it and owned it roughly for about three years - until I bought at another dealership almost immediately after it arrived there.

Obviously, about a year has lapsed since I purchased the car and three years since the last battery was checked/replaced....but it's bothersome to me that the wrong battery has been in the car ever since and well before I bought it, and could've caused serious damage, an accident, or something. I feel like I very easily could've had a lemon car to deal with but was insanely lucky.

I guess is there anything that I should do - what should someone like me in my position do - reach out to the original dealership or the dealership I bought it from, or just thank the card gods and just let it go?

For several months, I'd had a problem with my right-front turn signal light not working.  Stopped working in a rain storm.  Then 2-3 days later, worked again.  Worked fine until the next rain storm. Wash, rinse, repeat.  Fortunately, I'm in Southern California in a drought, so wasn't a *big* problem. 

Finally, it gave up the ghost.  It would work briefly when the first time I signaled, then not.  When it worked, the LEDs in my dashboard clock glowed normally.  When it stopped working, the LED's dimmed out.  Made me worry I had an expensive, difficult to find electrical problem.

So I bit the bullet.  Replaced the bulb.  Now the turn signal AND the clock work normally.  Noticed the filaments in the old bulb seemed intact.  

THE QUESTION IS, why did this bad bulb make my clock dim-out?   Must have affected other electrical things in car that I didn't notice?

I have a 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee that I took to a mechanic today to replace the serpentine belt. Part of the car's drive belt tensioner broke last week so I got it fixed, but the belt still needed to be replaced because it was making that screechy noise when you first turned on the car. I went to a mechanic that a friend recommended as the person that usually works on my car is out of town. I picked it up a couple hours ago and the mechanic told me that the AC compressor was still making a ton of noise. I was a little confused because the noise I was referring to was never the AC compressor, but I could clearly hear it after he turned the AC on to show me. I obviously told him that was never the issue, and he was surprised. I immediately started to feel something was up because then he proceeded to ask if I wanted to replace the AC compressor. We are currently experiencing the first cold nights of the season so I obviously do not need the AC. I asked what happened and he told me it was already like that. I told him no, and after going back and forth about it, I just paid him for the work he did and left because I was getting upset.
I just drove home from a friends and now the heat is no longer working. Does the compressor have to do with the heat not working? It also makes the same noise the mechanic showed me. I popped the hood and took a video of it just so folks can get a visual, but basically wanting to know what to do to get the heat fixed? Like, is this normal after replacing the belt? I am just confused and frustrated :(


Edit: Hi! Thank you to everyone who left a comment. I went the next day to have it fixed, explained what most of y‚Äôall said was wrong, and I am happy to report that my AC and heat are working now!

1o2lzkq,Hyundai burning oil...,"Hello all,

I have got a 2016 Sonata with a 2.4 liter. Before  you comment on why I bought it, it was at the time when the extent of the issues with them was not still discovered. Also, I may not have seen all of the information. I thought that I would avoid the early 2011-2014 models that were known to have problems in 2020 already.

The car was not burning much oil. Maybe 2,500 or 3,000- I had to add oil as the level was somewhere around halfway down on the dipstick. Then, I switched to Pennzoil Platinum and the burning was almost gone, very negligible. I was satisfied with that.

Fast forward 2.5 years, I replaced the PCV valve with a cheap O'Reilly's one. And one time 5 months later, I checked the oil and it was down on the dipstick, much quicker that normally. I was alarmed and started checking oil much more frequently. I knew on the back of my mind by this time about the oil burning problems with Hyundai. I would need to add oil  more frequently as time went on from last year. Not much, just 100-200 ml most of the time. The level would drop after oil changes not right away but after about 2,000 miles. This led me to believe that oil was degrading and was not resilient as  much to burning. Then, this interval kept dropping with time. I used Valvoline Restore and Protect for 5 oil changes, in hopes that the rings will be cleaned. It has not worked for me. I can see the oil level drop after 500 miles or a little more, after the oil change now. I now see the oil drop after driving 150 miles.

I finally replaced the PCV valve, which I got from the dealer just in case the other one might have been of poor quality and I wanted to rule that out as the cause of burning oil. It looks exactly as the one from the dealership. I can now confirm- it has not worked. The car does seem to have more power, though.

I have not had the engine blow up as many other people had. The car currently has 117K, with the original engine. With the situation of burning oil getting worse, in my mind I now only have a few options left to try to fix the issue, since I would want to keep the car if I can for now.

Option1: Move up to Amsoil Signature Series, as it may be more resilient to burning. I used Pennzoil Ultra Platinum, but it was not as resilient to oil burning as the Platinum one.

Option2: Move to 5w-30, I currently use 5w-20. However, with the recent video from Motor Oil Geek(Lake Speed Jr.) about precisely this topic, it may be a poor choice.

Option3: Pay a lot of money for diagnostics/repair (if even possible to fix this).

Option4: Keep adding oil and check the level after every 150  miles. But considering this, the oil burning may get worse with time. I have to currently add somewhere of 1 quart, probably a more between 4K oil changes. I know you guys will say that this is not that much, but the level is dropping quick now.

Option 5: keep adding oil and start preparing to get another car.

What are the potential outcomes with the burning, other than the catalytic converter's lifespan?

Can I still save the engine with simpler repairs?

Done a few brake jobs before never encountered such problem.

1o3eayc,Car broke down after Take 5,"Hello I dont know much about cars, but I try to keep my car well maintained and working.

My car broke down as I was in the drive thru of McDonald's yesterday. It was working fine, got the oil changed at Take 5 at 4:40, 4:45ish I drove down the street to Mcds, at 4:50 the car has completely broken down (No exaggeration, I have time stamps.). Couldnt even get it to start back up. The key was put of the car but it kept acting like it was trying to start/the speedometer arrows were moving around. 

I did notice as I was leaving Take 5 that there was a...noise? Sounded sort of like a muffled clinking maybe. And the red oil can shaped light was on as I left/possibly shortly after I left.
I was going to wheel into the parking lot and check to see what the noise was after I got my food but my poor car didnt last that long. Had to have the mcd employees come out and help push my car into an empty parking space.

Called triple A and they couldn't jump the battery. 
Had to have it towed to a shop. :( The mechanic haven't gotten back to me with a diagnosis, Ive called several times and dont want to call again today because Ive already called too much. (Don't want to get on their bad side.) 

In the meantime, anyone have any ideas what might be wrong with it? I gassed it up before I got the oil change yesterday, so plenty of gas. There's plenty of coolant. Like the car literally slowed down and died as I was moving through the drive thru. 

I have a suspicion it had something to do with the oil change but dont even have a diagnostic yet, and Im no mechanic. 
I drive a 2018 Ford Focus. Anyone had a similar experience or a suggestion? Could it possibly be related to the oil change or  is this more likely a coincidence?

1o3cv1v,Where to look other than alternator & battery?,"I acquired this 2011 Honda Accord EXL V6 a few months ago (mid-june) with 83k miles from a central FL Honda dealer. Sold As Is. A month into ownership (July 27th), the alternator fully blew after giving on & off days of symptoms to my uneducated self. Replaced alt myself with a reman Duralast 110 alt. This lasted from then until last weekend.

Come past weekend, roughly Oct 3, the new alternator began failing to charge my battery. Inconsistent battery light. Voltage would vary from 11.5v to 12.7v when it wasnt working, and when I punched it, it would begin recharging back up to 13.5v to 14.2v, but would soon stop. Battery diagnostic pointed to alternator (read as bad charging system)

Yesterday, I exchanged my almost 3 month old reman alternator for a brand new Duralast alternator under Autozone warranty. Didn‚Äôt have the time to do it this time so I paid a shop to do it. All was fine after replacement. Voltage consistent at 14.2-14.4v. Today, it is fluctuating between 14.2v and dropping to 12.7v, somewhat dependent on acceleration/deceleration. Was doing this in city, but not on highway. 

-OE Honda battery read good on test
-No fluids are leaking on to alternator
-Belt not showing signs of wear
-Intermittently working 

My big question, where else could I be looking to see what is causing my system to fail? If it comes to wiring,  will the $100 electric diagnostic from Honda be good, or would it be better to find an automotive electrician of sorts?

Have a hard look at your battery ground cable. Check resistance from the ends as you have someone wiggle it around to see if you get some crazy fluctuations. If it‚Äôs turned to dust inside the insulation you won‚Äôt know by eyeballing it. Hell, it may just be a loose connection causing it.
That can also cause your alternator to work a lot harder, possibly overheat the VR etc.

Ford 302 (engine swapped)

Anyone able to help me out here? It ran before I changed the plugs and wires.

When I first got the car, it ran. But the wires for the plugs were very unusual in that it wasn‚Äôt in an order that it‚Äôs normally supposed to be. 

Before it was:

Back

3    6

8    7

2    1

5    4

Front

3 days later, I found out the engine was a 302. (I was unaware of the model prior to this) then learned of its order and put it in as follows:

Back

3    8

6    7

4    5

1    2

Front

In other words, the 4 and 2 cylinders are swapped and the 6 and 8 are swapped.

Now I‚Äôm getting this popping sound. The reason I changed it was since I was running VERY rich. I‚Äôm talking 2 gallons in 5 minutes. Despite turning my Holley 4160s fuel and air ratio screws to the leanest. 

Additionally, I was told I may have misfiring cylinders. Since the timing on the harmonic balancer was going:

However since you're driving a Nissan and they have the CVT problems I'd just leave it be and baby it till it completely dies on you. Make sure to keep the cash on the side for the replacement transmission or for a new vehicle.

This 107 has 2 keys, I vaguely remember having trouble with one key when the car was new to us and just chucked it in the cupboard till now. So she never had central locking. 

OK, so 2 keys. 

Key A fob has no buttons for central locking. 

Key B has got buttons for central locking. 

If I use key A, start the car, turn it off and then use key B to start the car, it works. 

Now, if when I turn the car off with key B and then remote lock the doors and then remote unlock the doors, key B will not restart the car!

Again, If I swap to key A, start the car, turn it off and then use key B to start the car, it works!

So, basically, if I use key B for the central locking you need key A to start the car! 

How do I get the car ignition to recognise key B after using it to remote unlock.

Quick way to tell:

* **Lifter tick** = fast, light tapping from the top end, usually not louder under load.
* **Rod knock** = deeper metallic *knock* that gets worse with throttle/load and stays when warm.

Check your **oil level/condition** first, then try listening with a stethoscope or screwdriver (end to the part and handle to your ear) on the valve cover vs. oil pan. If it‚Äôs louder down low, that‚Äôs bad news (bearings).

Fuzzywink (Score: 1): That's not completely flat but it is very low and the sidewall has been damaged by driving on it underinflated.  Most likely there's a nail or screw or something in the tread somewhere letting air out and it wasn't caught before it got this low.  It may have been patchable before but with the sidewall damage from driving it really should just be replaced.  That's about as straightforward a repair as it gets and just about any place that works on cars should be able to dismount a tire and mount/balance a new one they sell you.  You may even be able to just air this one back up and (carefully) drive to a shop if it isn't leaking too fast or bulging at the sidewall.  If not, you could always take the wheel off and just bring the wheel and tire to a shop in another vehicle.  

I would add that just like with many types of products, with tires you get what you pay for.  Good quality name brand tires might cost twice as much as cheapies but they last twice as long and ride/handle better the whole time.  If you don't already have a preferred model of tire, the shop will probably offer a range of options at different price points and I would at least avoid the cheapest few options if possible"

Stopped at a gas station yesterday and when I came back out it turns, but wouldn‚Äôt turn to the Start position. Eventually it got towed back to my place where the battery was so dead the only way to lock and unlock my doors was manually with my key. 

Replaced the battery and power is back on, but still having the same issue. (I figured it wouldn‚Äôt have been the end solution to the problem). I even put some graphite lube in there.

In the message center it alternates between the  Battery light and the Security light. I tried the 10 minute security trick where you leave the key in the On position for 10 minutes and then turn it, but also no resolution (figured).

I sent a video to my mechanic friend and he said the cruise control is glitching, which he said he‚Äôs never seen before in the many years of owning his own shop.

If I was in your situation, if the bitch still runs & drives, Id throw that bitch on Facebook market for a grand, maybe 1500, be honest about the condition & what's happening but make sure you emphasize that it runs & drives. 

The other option is to part the bitch out. Put all usable parts in a storage place & slowly make some cash off all of it by putting it on Facebook market as a parts car, list all car parts with cheap quick prices (ex; door is 125, mirror is 40, seats are 120) and make a couple hundred off it over the course of time. Strip it dry of radio, car seats, trims, bumpers, doors, regulators - pull everything you can off it.

It'll ask for information on the vehicle & based off what you tell it, it'll give you a quote of what the car is worth.

Looking for some advice on a recurring issue.

I‚Äôve got a 2017 VW Golf GTD with 19-inch low-profile tyres. Over the last three years, I‚Äôve had to replace tyres ridiculously often ‚Äî on average every three months. Either they fail at MOT, get punctures, or deflate because of small rips or sidewall damage.

Car details:
	‚Ä¢	Full VW service history, serviced annually.
	‚Ä¢	Most recent service 3 months ago: replaced front shocks (both sides), front brake discs, and a couple of tyres.
	‚Ä¢	Since then, two tyres keep losing pressure every few drives ‚Äî likely needing replacement again.

I do my best to avoid potholes, but the ride is harsh and the impact noise is loud. I‚Äôm starting to wonder:
	‚Ä¢	Is this just bad luck or the nature of low-profile tyres?
	‚Ä¢	Could there be an underlying suspension or alignment issue VW hasn‚Äôt picked up?
	‚Ä¢	Is it worth switching from Pirelli (around ¬£165/tyre) to a cheaper brand (around ¬£85) given how often they go?
	‚Ä¢	Or should I look into a tyre warranty or protection plan?

I‚Äôve even had a tyre blow out within a month of replacing it after hitting a pothole, so it‚Äôs getting expensive and frustrating.

Any thoughts or experiences welcome ‚Äî would really appreciate advice on the likely cause and what‚Äôs the best way forward.

Almost certainly this is your handbrake too, issues with the caliper & worn pads = poor handbrake performance. I dont know about yours specifically, but its common for the handbrake to simply apply the disc brake now, rather than separate drum brakes being activated.

Pembs-surfer (Score: 4): Just new pads and discs and probably inner shoe kit with springs.

Hyundai rear brakes are so finicky, they basically need adjusting the cog wheel that sits behind the drum each year as well as re-greasing the self adjuster and spring. It‚Äôs a problem they‚Äôve had for decades at this point. I had to readjust my Santa Fe rear brake shoes at least once year. The self adjustment mechanism is just shit and they used the same mechanism on every year up until EPB came the norm.

1o34a09,"Chery Tiggo 8, is it really Britain's Biggest Bargain as the press is calling it?","My Nissan Xtrail e-Power is going back in a month, it was on a ¬£450 lease, the Retail is ¬£46,175. I was looking to replace it with a similarly priced (lease) 7 seater SUV and stumbled upon Chery Tiggo 8. Chery's Super Hybrid version is exactly the same as Nissan's e-Power in driving; the petrol engine is just a generator and the wheels are driven by electric motor (2 motors in case of Tiggo 8), which I really liked about the e-Power as it drives like an EV but without any range anxiety or need for longer charging. But while e-Power had a smaller 2.1kWh battery with 6-8 miles of electric-only range, the Tiggo 8 Hybrid has a 18.4kWh battery with a 56 miles of electric-only range, however, the combined MPG on both seems to be about similar. Tiggo 8 Hybrid Summit (top most tier) is priced at ¬£36,545, so around a 10K cheaper than Nissan Xtrail, and the lease is also cheaper, not to mention the thing is fully loaded with equipment and features.

Now, I understand that Chery is the parent company of Omoda and Jaecoo, and Jaecoo has sold well here in UK, but My concern is about the relative unknowns around Tiggo 8. I looked around and there were only three videos of the UK review, one has ""Best Bargain"" on the thumbnail, the second has ""Cheapest 7-seater SUV in UK"" and the third has ""Affordable"" on their thumbnail, but what about the reliability or the manufacturing quality etc?

so MY question is to our fellow UK car owners if anyone has bought one, or test driven one or your thoughts on this, or should I stick to Nissan and lease a new Xtrail e-Power?

andy_why (Score: 3): I've owned a CT and a UX so I can give you my opinion on both.

Both are small cars, but if you're one person and don't need to carry a lot then they're absolutely great cars all round for that. 

Most CT's are getting on a bit now. The 2010-2013 models have a piston ring design issue which causes oil burning at higher miles (100k+) so are best avoided if you can. They also get head gasket issues as a result of that making the EGR system clog up. Get a 2014+ if you want to avoid that.

Also consider the age of the hybrid battery. After about 10 years the failure rate goes up, so you'll always want to buy the newest you can unless you want to take the risk. Most will still keep going for 15+ years just fine, but the failure rate does increase.

The UX250h has a much better 2L engine and doesn't hang about when you put your foot down. It's one of the main reasons I got the UX when I had it. It's a bit less fuel efficient being a crossover and having the extra power, but not by a lot. I still averaged around 50mpg in the 18 months I owned it, and the CT was about 52mpg in the 7 years I owned it.

The CT has a firm ride, the UX has a softer ride. I didn't mind either, but the UX was definitely more comfortable.

You'll find that in winter the heat on short journeys works better in the CT as the UX has no auxiliary electric heating, it all comes from engine coolant. Getting a model with seat heaters/heated steering wheel is recommended.

I can't speak for the NX unfortunately, but it's Lexus, it's definitely going to be a good vehicle.

Paeir (Score: 1): Pictures of the damage would've been a big help. Honestly I'd just get a quote from a reputable garage to get it fixed and take the quote to the guy who hit you and see if he'll pay to get it repaired.

If he refuses then you'll have to go through insurance I'm afraid. It will raise your insurance but you're 24. Insurance prices tend to drop once you hit 25 so it might not be the worst thing in the world."
1o2tuus,Anti Theft Options?‚Ä¶,"Morning team. 

I‚Äôm about to make the biggest car purchase of my life (Mustang GT to be featured in another post when it‚Äôs actually home).

This is the first car I‚Äôve spent a real amount of money on, and I want to protect it as best I can. 

What are you go to security devices? I don‚Äôt like the idea of them immobilisers that require a separate fob or code to put in, had issues with them in the past (appreciate the technology has likely come a long way in the last 20 years). 

I‚Äôve been recommended one of them big steering wheel locks that cover the entire wheel, and I‚Äôm also exploring installing a collapsible bollard on the front of the drive. It can be blocked in nightly by my wife‚Äôs car, and we have faraday boxes for the keys as well as ring cameras covering the drive. I‚Äôll probably also hide an AirTag in there for good measure. 

I‚Äôm all ears to any other products/devices/options that you use. ",0,1760079174.0,16,CartalkUK,1760211178,2025-10-10 06:52:54,2025-10-11 19:32:58,"Felrathror86 (Score: 11): Post at the end of the driveway. And a proper tracker, not an air tag.

1o2tbtq,Returning a vehicle at the end of a PCP,"I have to return a vehicle I have had for the last two years in 3 weeks time as the PCP deal is up. Due to financial constraints I won't be able to take on another PCP vehicle, which is what I usually do.

Unfortunately the vehicle has a minor dent in the rear quarter, and i have driven nearly 8k miles over the contracted amount, so I'm aware I will have to pay for those if there's not enough equity in the vehicle. 

In regards to the dent, should I return as is and let the dealer charge me for it, or get it sorted before returning?

Electronic-Moose1 (Score: 8): It depends on the size of the damage. Are we talking a small ding or a dent? 

My wife didn‚Äôt check her last PCP in the weeks before it went back to Audi and there were a couple of dings on the drivers door from people opening doors into hers in car parks. Luckily they were so eager to get the car off her to sell on their forecourt, they didn‚Äôt charge for fixing the damage or even mention it after inspection during drop off. 

Personally, I would have sorted the damage prior to it being returned had I known about it, just for peace of mind.

If this thing does 70 I might buy one. I don't think there's any word on speed yet but it's a bit bigger than the others so fingers crossed.

Supposedly it can detect if a car stops in a designated zone (e.g. the zigzag bit, where no stopping is ever allowed) and can detect if a driver or passenger gets out the car, rather than just stopped because of slow traffic.
