1ncybkw,Shop spilled oil and ruined my alternator - How do I go about this?,"Got an oil change (only service done), and shortly after, my alternator seems to have failed.

Timeline:  
\-Drove 1.5 miles home from car shop – no issues, but car noticeably quieter.  
\-Next day, 4-mile round trip to work – no issues noticed, but it was heavy raining.  
\- Drove 1 mile to post office – heard a whining sound. On return, got a ""**charging system fault**"" error for the first time.  
\- Removed and replaced battery under warranty.  Then drove 100 yards, then same charge system fault error. Steering wheel became very hard to turn (likely no power steering due to belt on alternator controls steering).

Battery and alternator tested today – results below.  Battery little low because probably powering car, alternator 12.09V is very low.

Called another shop for alternator estimates and without me mentioning anything, the tech says alternators on my car often fail after due to oil leaking into them, either from gasket or oil filter, and he wants to make sure the issue is fixed or oil will just get into the new replaced alternator. I then mention I recently got an oil change and he tells me he covers the alternator with a taped bag when doing oil changes on my car.

Questions:  
(1)   **Is there any way to test if oil got into the alternator?**  I don't see oil on top of the alternator then again someone could have just wiped it off.  Belt and everything else with the alternator seems fine and intact.  
(2)  **How do I best address this with the shop?**  I'm sure they will try to tell me the alternator was already failing and they didn't damage it, but I don't think it's a coincidence I went from full A/C, radio, lights + added additional lights on my truck and everything working fine when I dropped off my car.  Now, six miles later I can barely turn the steeling wheel because the alternator is failing.  A natural dying alternator doesn't hit a brick wall.

Low oil pressure at Warm Idle.
-P06DD
-P0365

- 2 New oil pumps, soleniod, Checked oil gallery bolts, Verified correct filter( tried two different ones ) , New Cam Sensors and oil pressure sensor.

Oil pressure cold starts at around 600KPA (87 PSI)
Then slowly drops to 68 KPA ( 9 PSI ) or less.

The pump does switch into high mode when over 3,500 rpm until it gets really hot. Then it will only switch up to about 350 KPA roughly over 3500 rpm which is when it will set the P06DD.

The P0365 Sets somewhat randomly. That's probably gonna be a wiring issue at the sensor. But the oil pressure is an issue. It should be around 20-30 at least at warm idle. 9 PSI is just scary lmao

Ive had this car for about 2 years. I have a crack in my charcoal canister that’s popping up an EVAP leak check engine light (P0456 and P200A), and I also have 2 rear wheel speed sensors that are busted so my incline and ABS lights are on too. My dash looks like a Christmas tree right now but I’ve been told that these are relatively harmless things to drive with, just get them fixed when ya can.

When I called a mechanic about a quote to finally fix these things, he kind of made it sound like these are both extremely important things that need to be fixed asap. He said the charcoal canister could leak into the rest of my system which could mess up a lot of other stuff and the sensors are making my car’s computer run constantly. 

The issue is that it’s going to cost me about $2,000 ($1,300 for charcoal canister, $750 for both sensors)to get these fixed, and that’s not an expense I can handle right now. He said that it would make more sense to do them at the same time because they’re in the same general area. Should I get them both done at the same time, or could I split them up into two things and just get the more important one fixed first?

Also consider oil also can foul a plug.  If you have a compression problem with oil entering the combustion chamber at those rpms, that could be a possibility as well.  Week spark could also be a problem, but you replaced the plug and coild, so I'd steer away from that line of thinking.  I'd go with the theory, that the injector is staying open for longer than it should, or you have oil making it's way into the cylinder.  You might even pull the intake and look at that port ..

My family has had this vehicle since 2004 and it’s been a work horse ever since. However, in the past 2 years I keep getting a misfire on cylinder 6 after it rains. When we open her up, we see moisture in with the spark plug on that cylinder only. This happens whether or not I drive in the rain or if she just sits in the driveway. I live in AZ so I’m not sure if condensation is happening after it rains since it’s so hot causing a build up of moisture. But it’s odd that it’s only that cylinder. 
We have checked and replaced the spark plugs and boots but still have this issue. There doesn’t seem to be any sealing issues that we can see. We’ve also taken it to multiple shops but haven’t had any solutions. Drying off the spark plug seems to do the trick until the next time it rains (luckily that isn’t too often here).

Little secret I'll let you in on, if you have a scan tool or Bluetooth module and a diagnostic program for bmw. Use it fix the timing, doesn't matter at what degrees advance. Then take a timing light, probably need an inductance one, if you don't own should be cheap enough to rent. Anyways, fix the timing and rev the engine to about 1500-2500 rpm. Watch the mark in the crank pulley with the timing light and see if it stays nice and still or if the mark jumps around randomly back and forth. If the mark is erratic then you have slop in your timing chain and you need to start teardown and repair before your engine grenades. Just a quick easy way to assess the timing system on chain driven engines without any disassembly. Also, in this situation far as a pulley is concerned a stethoscope is your best friend. CAREFULLY touch the pulley bolt with the engine running and out the scope to your ear. If there is a issue it will be noticed easily. Try other pulleys and other things around the engine to understand the difference in audible magnitudes of what a normal level of volume or sound is versus something that's failing. Any auto parts store should have one for 10-20 bucks. Use caution when using the scope and the engine is running. I don't need to elaborate on the dangers of having something tied to your head and poking it around the drive belt system of a running engine right? Good luck brother"

I am a 17 year old highschool student starting his senior year, I am at the point where instead of fawining over cars online I want to build one, I know basically nothing about actually *building* cars. My budget is around **$6k≈**

Here’s what I’ve been thinking:

* I love the look of the **2001 Honda Accord**, so I thought about using that as a base.
* A friend told me the **K24 engine** and do a engine swap(not to sure about that due to lack of experience) is a good option since they’re cheap and have good aftermarket support.
* My first thought was just buy a car throw some turbos on and go fast — with a dream top speed of around **165 mph** — but I know that’s oversimplifying.
* Since I’m new, I was thinking maybe it makes more sense to buy a car that already came with a K24stock instead of trying an engine swap right away.

**My questions:**

1. If I add a turbo, what other parts would absolutely need to be upgraded like transmission?
2. Which version of the **K24** is best for a budget-friendly turbo build?
3. Is starting with a 2001 Accord even smart for a sleeper, or should I look for something else?
4. With a $6k budget, how realistic is this as a beginner project? Should I start smaller just to get experience?

Got it towed, and to a shop within a few days. They said it needed a new transmission (which I was expecting). 

It took them almost a week and half to get in the new transmission, and almost another week to get it installed which isn't the biggest deal for me, as it wasn't my only means of transportation at the time. 

I spoke with him yesterday and he is saying that the TCM has been reading a different VIN number then the actual car, since he got it in the shop and is having issues flashing and reprograming it. They are saying that the TCM is pretty much bricked at this point and I'll have to buy a new TCM and pay for reprogramming.

(I got the car with a 25-30k miles, so I wouldn't see why the previous owner would of done anything with the TCM, but it is a CVT transmission, so who knows if he was already having issues or not)

  
Just wanted to know if this is something common, or what to think about it. Everything I look into is saying that my car should of been pushing an error code, if the TCM was actually reading an incorrect VIN the entire time. I attached the diagnostic I ran 3 days before bringing it into the shop. 

I went through DEQ a few months ago as well, without any concern.

If you use cheap gas (local mom/pop station, rotten robbie, etc.), it's possible that enough carbon has built up enough to suffocate the system? However, an intermittently failing fuel pump or fuel system component wouldn't cause the shifter to have issues.

You said that the second guy was able to reverse it onto his truck. I can't tell by the way this was written, but did he try to put your car into drive when he picked it up and failed? Or did he just throw it in reverse and load it? I'm guessing that he tried and that it failed, but again, I'm not 100% sure. After test driving it, he checked the starter (that's an easy one to check) and he ""checked"" the transmission, but did he check for any DTC codes? Did he check fuel pressures and trims? When did you last replace the spark plugs? I ask because if they weren't changed, worn plugs can cause misfires which could feel like a ""shudder,"" but misfires will also throw codes. 

It sounds like it's acting up enough for a tech to experience the same thing you are after a few test drives, so if he's saying that he can't find anything wrong with it, I'd start looking for another reputable independent shop in your area...one that's more well-versed with this kind of thing.

Their best use is for engine swaps or other custom work, when you’ve got to build a custom intake from scratch. They’re absolute lifesavers in that situation. For modern stock vehicles, what’s the point?

The increase in performance, if any, is too small to notice or measure. It’s trivial. It may have been noticeable on the old carbureted cars where the air filter affected your mixture, but not on anything modern. Late model intakes are very well designed. 

The decrease in filtration, if any, is too small to notice. It’s trivial. Nobody’s engine is failing due to a tiny speck of dust that made it through the K&N but would’ve been stopped by paper.

They filter better than the old oil baths but not as well as a quality paper filter, they restrict less than paper, who knows or cares, this is absolute trivia. 

The increase in maintenance is also trivial. You only need to clean and oil them on very rare occasions, when you’re already doing car stuff. No big deal. 

The cost savings are trivial. You paid more up front to save on paper filters that honestly don’t cost a lot anyway. 

All in all, you gain approximately nothing and it costs you approximately nothing. They work fine. The fact that you can install one on any arbitrary engine in any arbitrary car, can be very useful for modders. It has its place in the world. But by itself it does nothing. 

Since you’ve already got this, just drive it and enjoy it and maybe clean and oil it every year or two depending on how much you drive.

BluGalaxie42 (Score: 5): There are probably going to be a lot of responses dismissing me. Still, to the OP, think of the engineering that Chevy went through to make your SS sound impressive, fast, and fun? They put in a helmholz resonator in line, filtered the air to keep the engine safe, and sized the throttle body for the street, not strip. I can't see if the previous owner did any power improvements like modifying the cam, better heads, higher compression, larger fuel injectors, or a larger throttle body. The reason the ""cold air intake"" sounds tough is because it replaces chevy's engineering and allows the valve harmonics to disturb the intake airflow... slowing it down with turbulence. Sure, it growls. But it is more like an asthmatic wheeze than a growl. If you want a growl, address the exhaust with a different muffler/resonator setup. If you want a better breathing engine, insulate the intake ductwork, locate the actual air intake somewhere far forward of the radiator, and use a filter (of your choice) that has a much larger filtration surface area. These bolt-on sets dumb down the engineering that YOUR car's engine management system relies upon to give you the best power. Just because you can supposedly move more air doesn't mean the O2 sensors, computer, MAF/MAP, and TPS are going to give a shit if it's a K&N."

From what I understand, this is supposed to clean the injectors, throttle body, and intake tract.

Here are my concerns/questions:

* Since my Passat has a direct injection (DI) engine, will this service actually do anything for carbon buildup on the intake valves? From what I’ve read, DI engines don’t get the same benefit from chemical cleaners since fuel never washes over the valves.
* Would running something like BG 44K (fuel system cleaner added to the tank) achieve a similar result, at least for injectors and combustion chambers?
* I’m not having any issues with the car — fuel economy is good, no rough idle or hesitation. So I’m wondering if this is just upsell “maintenance” or if there’s a real preventative benefit here.

Has anyone with a VW/Audi DI engine actually seen a benefit from the BG PFI service? Or is it smarter to skip it, stick with periodic BG 44K/Techron in the tank, and plan for a walnut blast cleaning of the intake valves later on if needed?",1,1757437071.0,1,CarTalk,1757532863,2025-09-09 16:57:51,2025-09-10 19:34:23,"pbgod (Score: 1): Years ago, my old dealer owner tried to push BG on us.

It helped, but not enough that the car (which had a problematic level of build-up) didn't still need a cleaning. If you did it every 20k or so, it would probably work well enough, but ultimately it would cost more than just doing a cleaning.

That version of that engine isn't as prone to carbon build-up being a problem, but it does happen. That service would do what it says as a maintenance if you desire it, I wouldn't count on it resolving a problem if you have one. 

>Since my Passat has a direct injection (DI) engine, will this service actually do anything for carbon buildup on the intake valves? From what I’ve read, DI engines don’t get the same benefit from chemical cleaners since fuel never washes over the valves.

That treatment is a fogger, the solvent gets aerosolized into the intake manifold, so it does affect the valves.

Yes, there is even a factory VW cleaner that we occasionally apply if we see the injection span increasing that indicates clogging injectors."

1nc9t49,2007 Toyota Yaris YRS - Leaking AC,"HELLO!

I’m hoping someone here has experience with this issue or can point me in the right direction.

I have a 2007 Toyota Yaris YRS NCP93R (FWD), and the air conditioning system is leaking water into the passenger footwell, and occasionally into the driver’s side as well. The leak is getting progressively worse and is now starting to affect my electronics (e.g., Bluetooth/radio).

Background:

* The car has never been in an accident.
* The issue began when it had around 45,000 km on the odometer (now at 65,000 km).
* Although it’s an older car, it was kept indoors for a long time and accumulated a lot of dust during that time. It was not needed by the previous owner and was fully functional when I purchased it.
* It did not have a cabin air filter installed from factory, and a food wrapper was sucked into the fan from the passenger footwell. I removed the wrapper and installed a cabin filter afterwards. This is when the problems began.

Symptoms:

* Water leaks into the passenger footwell when turning right, especially during sharp turns.
* Leak occurs only in warm/humid weather. It does not leak in winter. The hotter it is outside, the more water leaks into the cabin.
* The leak tends to build up and release suddenly, almost like pooling and dumping during cornering. 
* The AC used to make a ‘screeching’ sound before I replaced the AC Heater Fan Blower

What I’ve tried so far:

* Initially, I checked the AC drain pipe for blockages, and it doesn’t seem to be blocked.
* I took it to a Car AC specialist (Jack Frost Car Air-Conditioning) and they quoted over $2,000 to replace the entire AC system, which seemed excessive for a car with such low use and no damage.
* I worked with my grandfather (experienced mechanic) and we replaced the condenser and compressor – no improvement.
* Had it re-gassed – the tech who did this suggested the issue could be with the Heater Fan Blower.
* I replaced the AC Heater Fan Blower – this helped slightly but the leaking came back again once summer came back around.

I’ve seen a few posts about people having similar issues to this but none of the fixes seem to help. If anyone could link a post/forum which discusses this issue OR has personally dealt with this issue and knows how to fix it, I will love you forever.

In addition, the display kept cycling between the a/c controls and the banner for the anti - theft system, without me pressing any buttons. Left the car running for an hour before turning it off. This morning, car starts with no issues. I don’t know Jack about cars but this seems like an electrical issue. Any thoughts? 

Edit: if this is a battery issue, for context, this is the fourth time I’ve had to buy a new battery in less than 2 years. Could all these battery issues be indicative of an issue with the car?

It has been running great…until now.

I’m so confused on what could be the problem and was hoping anyone could give knowledge as to what might be wrong and bonus points if you could give me a “in the ball park” estimate of the fix if you are extra savvy. I’m not sure if this is important to mention as I know absolutely nothing about mechanics, but the strangest thing happened today, I started the car and the battery gage started jumping around at almost everything I did including pressing the gas and accelerating, so much so that it was making a wine sound through the radio speaker even tho the radio was completely turned off.

Unfortunately, turns out my insurance is trying to lower costs to fit the threshold for my policy/damages in order to repair the vehicle (even though the girl who hit me claimed fault & apparently damages exceed her policy which is why it moved over to my policy?)

With that being said, insurance now lowered some of the estimates but by requesting a part with a used quarter panel instead of a new one which lowered costs by a couple thousand apparently. Now my body shop refuses to install the part for OEM purposes. (Makes sense.)

I did a little research and now my concern is because this part affects the structural integrity of the vehicle and can be a safety issue,

1nckje1,"Bought a used Citroën Berlingo – both low beams not working, missing diode in fuse box?","Hi everyone,

I recently bought a used **Citroën Berlingo M 1.6 HDI 92 BV (cargo)**. Before the purchase I paid for a professional pre-purchase inspection, and everything was reported as fine.

We parked it for about a week while equipping it with tools and fittings, and when I finally tried driving it at night, I noticed **neither of the low beam headlights work** (right and left).

I checked the fuse box and took a photo – I noticed that a diode seems to be missing below a headlight relay. From what I understand, that might actually be related to the fog lights, but I’m not 100% sure.

Now I’m starting to suspect that the dealer I bought it from may have removed some components before delivery.

Has anyone seen this before with Berlingos? Could a missing diode/relay explain why both low beams don’t work, or should I be checking elsewhere?

Thanks in advance for any help!

PD. Is it normal to have those wires exposed in the lower left corner?

PD2. I swapped both 625 relays to see if one is faulty and both are fine. (top of the photo)

It’s entirely possible you used your first set of tires well beyond their safe life, and when you replaced them they were past due.  While now with your current tires you’re replacing them earlier in their life, before it becomes a safety issue.  

Lots of city or stop/go driving often wears tires faster than the same mileage on the highway. Parallel parking and tight turns add onto this wear.

I didn’t wanna take any chances on it messing up on me specially on the highway. My advice to you. Is if your car is paid off and you can afford a new vehicle . Trade this one in. You don’t want that thing giving out on you on the highway. And if you’re not in a position to get a new vehicle then start an emergency fund for the car in case the head gasket becomes a problem so you’re able to get it repaired."

When the gears are worn / damaged you can usually hear it most when you’re coasting or decelerating. 

The fluid could also be low, which if you catch quick enough and add differential fluid before any damage is done could resolve the issue, though if you’ve driven it much you’re probably out of luck there.

We poked around under the hood, didn't see anything immediately off, and tried to crank it again. The engine wouldn't even turn over, the smell came back, and a small bit of white smoke was coming from under the hood, so we stopped trying and called a tow truck.

3 Years ago i hard starting issues that left me stranded one time. I replaced the starter and thought I fixed it. But over the past 3 years the reliability has gone down hill starting wise. The truck is a backup that only gets driven maybe once or twice a week but will need to become my DD once snow flies. It drives perfect when it starts just rarely wants to start.

What I have done so far:

New starter (hook starter directly to battery using jumper cables and works flawlessly)

New Battery

New alternator (old alternator was over volting)

Ran 2 new ground lines (truck is very rusty)

Replaced these relays:

 A month ago when I replaced the relays i thought I fixed it. The truck would start time after time. I let it sit a week and now its back to not starting. 

CEL comes on but my Mac scanner will not hook to the truck for some reason and I cant get the truck to AutoZone. CEL is only on when the truck wont start. When running its gone

Voltages are in the mid 13s so it should try to start but all I hear is the solenoid clicking but the starter itself isn't even trying to spin. Have tried both sets of keys i own and nothing. With the keys in the ignition I have full power to all accessories just not starting.

Is there anything else to look into before I take it into a shop (which I really can't afford right now)

Side note: Don't know where to add this but just thought of it. This past spring the truck would fail to start sometimes but doing the key dance once or twice it would start right up.

1ncwd92,Head Scratching Misfire Issue on 2015 Ford Fiesta SE. Maybe caused by vacuum leak?,"MAYBE FIXED! I ran the ""relearn misfire profiles"" command in forscan and that seems to have fixed my issue. I'll update if that doesn't end up being the case (forscan recommends running it if cam pos sensors were changed and that sorta thing and I figured that this being a different engine, even using the same cam pos sensors, that maybe it was worth a shot.



CEL codes it throws are p0420 p0300 p0302 p0303. 1.6L tivct duratec motor. No mods. Pictures included for context below

The misfire occurs only on cylinders 2 and 3, and only occurs under engine braking \~3k rpm if above 45mph or if driving at medium to light throttle above 45mph. Full throttle does not misfire at least up to 90mph. Standard driving with cruise control off doesn't cause misfire unless I let off throttle at 70mph for minor engine braking.

What is interesting though is that the misfire feels like a gentle misfire. You can only tell through loss of power as the engine sounds the same more or less. Observing the misfire count via forscan I registered 3600 misfires on a 45min drive mostly at 55-60mph. It only ever misfired during engine braking at 60mph or under the intentional medium throttle from 0 up to 60mph.

I will say I have rebuilt this engine and the only thing I can guess that is causing the issue is a tiny leak at the intake manifold at the mating surface of the manifold and the head as in between 2 and 3, some yokel broke the surrounding aluminum and it looks like it maybe could've possibly caused an issue with proper sealing but idk tbh. I have no way to prove this theory however unless I suppose I use a smoke machine. No codes being thrown for lean or rich running and fuel trims are + or - 2% from 0.

What I've tried:  
Replace all spark plugs. Gap plugs few thou smaller than stock. Improved engine smoothness dramatically but still misfires. There is no extra soot or anything on the misfiring cylinders, at least after 1k miles.

Replace plug wires. Made no noticeable difference

Replace coil pack with used coil pack. Made no noticeable difference.

Tested compression. All cylinders within small margin of each other.

Swapped injectors in between cylinders. No difference

 Last time she had the oil change was 4 odd months ago.

The reason why I think that it was a viscosity reduction additive because the oil stain on the floor looks thinner that usual. The way it flow and spread out on the floor. 
I looked under the hud. It's the valves cover that's leaking and I change the gasket. Problem solved.

Hello, 

My 2007 Buick Lucrene CXL with the 3800 engine (117k miles) has a misfire in cylinder 4. I replaced the spark plugs and made sure they were gapped correctly. After everything was all done and put back into place, I still get a rough idle and engine light flashes after a few mins. 

After confirming with the engine reader that it's still missing in the same cylinder, I double checked everything was installed properly and secured.. now I'm not sure what to do next? I was told I could switch my spark plug wires (Swap number 2 and 4 wires to see if the misfire move.)  but I just ended up getting a multiple misfire code as well as bank 1 too lean code. Switched them back and havent touched it since.

Ok so you have new plugs, next test to make sure the plug is actually sparking, buy a cheap $5 inline spark tester is it lighting up ? Or if you are confident you have no spark leaks you can take the spark plug out and ground it and watch for spark. 

Ok so after you verify that you have spark on cylinder 4 that rules out Spark as the issue. Next for me would be to swap the fuel injector #2 with #4 and see if the misfire follows. Also check the wiring going to the fuel injector can use a led test light. If the misfire follows you have a bad fuel injector.  If the misfire doesn't follow then next would be to do a compression test and figure out what's wrong with the air in that cylinder"

I moved from Oklahoma to Indiana on July 31st. By some miracle, my car survived and on August 1st, broke down. Im currently staying with a friend.

I was recommended to a small mechanic in my friends town and decided to go with them as they had open availability within the week to take a look at and hopefully fix my car, compared to large repair shops where the earliest appointment was the end of the month. 

The mechanic, despite telling me multiple times that they'd get my car looked at within a day or two(my appointment was originally set for the 5th of August), didn't actually look at my car until the beginning of September. This included several attempts of me texting and calling with no answers whatsoever.

Eventually he calls me back and says they started checking out the car and 30 minutes later says my engine block is cracked with no further internal issues and won't be covered under warranty. He says this would be due to over heating. The cost would be approximately $2200 to replace the engine.

My car never over heated. Its up to date on oil, coolant, tires, everything. I had it checked before the move and was told everything looked great.

On top of all of this, I called my warranty company just to verify things and was informed a mechanic had never called about my car or account.

Im getting the car towed to a proper dealership and repair shop as the can accept payment plans for the car. When I told the mechanic this, he said he wouldnt let them tow it unless I paid $200. I understand the labor he did, but at the same time he kept my car for over a month with false deadlines and no updates. The car also isnt put together, hes just leaving the parts in the back.

Im fine paying, but idk if there's really anything else I can or need to do reguarding him lying and everything. It all just seems sketchy to me.

TLDR: Mechanic kept my car way longer than he said (22 days from the original appointment) to only tell me its junk and say its $200 to get it back. Also lied about talking to my warranty company.

You pick and choose what work you want done but the price of the work stays the same either way. The only people who can discount work is the ones that mark it up above what it's supposed to be. 

I'd get the 02 sensor and knock sensor done for sure, but as for the ABS sensor, get yourself a second opinion first. You do not want to put off ABS sensor replacements as you don't want your ABS locking up on you or activating when it's not supposed to, but it's also not exactly common for both ABS sensors to suddenly ""get bad"". If you haven't noticed any ABS issues he may be full of shit.

1nco8tb,Hyundai Tucson Possible Battery or Alternator Issues,"2020 Hyundai Tucson, \~61k miles, Automatic, 2.0L Engine

Yesterday, when I tried to start my car it wouldn't start. I took out the key after trying to start it and it made a clicking noise and the screen between my odometer and speedometer was flashing (video attached). I let it sit for a few minutes and tried starting it again, then the dashboard started to light up and still had some clicking noises, but my engine would never turn or make a sound like it wanted to turn (video attached). The interior lights weren't on and the windows wouldn't roll down, making me think it was the battery. My boyfriend tried to jump it and was connected to the car for nearly 20 minutes and it still wouldn't start correctly. This morning, he went back to the parking lot where my car is stranded and tired to jump it again and it still won't turn on.

I've never had any mechanical issues with the vehicle before. My most recent oil change was 8/2/25. I WFH and drive my car around maybe 4x/week but less than 50 miles/week.

Any thoughts on what this might be before I call a mobile mechanic or get it towed?

When starting, the choke plate must be closed completely which I believe is normal. It then idles at about 5K rpm which seems is a little high. The RPM can be increased by opening the throttle and then it runs at about 7K however not very smooth. This is all with the chocke still closed. As soon as the choke is opened to let more air in it dies instantly. Would it be ok to run it normally like this? It just seems weird. I have tuned the carb to the “default” setting which I have found in a manual. I just cannot seem to figure out why it dies when more air is added. Yes it makes sense, that the mixture is wrong but why.

Old cars will always have old car stuff that needs taking care of. Create headroom by buying something with regular mileage and good service history.

Regular mileage is around 12,000 miles per year. The premiums for something with 6,000-9,000 miles per year are just not worth it imo. The price delta can cover many 10 year/100k mile repairs.

The 2013 Civic LX or EX is a great option I see regularly under $10k with regular mileage. Regular mileage tends to sit around $6-8k asking on FB with 1-2 owners and clean title. 2013 was the last year for the torque converter automatic (one of the most reliable automatics Honda ever produced), and the motor is a very easy to own and maintain 1.8L that has a timing chain. Super reliable.

A car of this vintage is going to need some work, but if you get in at around $6-7k, you can have a car that will have a cost of ownership likely to be under $5k over 5 years including depreciation and maintenance. 

A/C leaks or broken A/C compressors can happen with any car with this kind of age, so when you get a regular mileage car, you can easily budget A/C repair and have it sealed tight and blowing cold for the next 10-15 years of ownership. There are a few other examples of cars of this era that are simply fantastic, but I always find myself landing on the 2013 civic EX/LX as my top recommendation for a reasonably modern bulletproof car.

1nck9zj,Removing extra engine oil with a syringue and tube,"Hi all,

2018 Subaru Crosstrek with 92,000 km

I got my oil changed at the garage. 3 months later, my check engine light came on so I decided to check my engine oil level and noticed I'm way over the maximum fill limit. I'm assuming they didn't empty my transmission fluid because I've driven 3000km since then and haven't noticed any issues with its driving performance. So I'll chalk it off as them forgetting to empty my old oil before refilling it, or being careless about the amount they put in.

I haven't driven the car in 3 weeks since the check engine light came because I was on vacation.

I don't own a jack and I don't want to drive to the nearest garage to get my oil changed because I don't want to damage my engine (although I've already driven with double the oil for months...) nor do I trust them anymore. I also want to gain more independence by learning how to do things myself.

So I bought a pvc tube and a syringe to remove some of the extra oil via the dipstick entry. I've never done this before. I am just wondering if anyone has any tips and if I should run the car first since it hasn't move in 3 weeks, to ""refresh"" the oil before removing some? Not sure if that makes sense. Also, I've read that it would be good idea to warm up the engine to remove the oil more easily. Any idea how many minutes that means? I'm terrified of heating the oil up too much and melting my pvc tube.

Now you say you don't have a jack. Well you don't need one. 

Changing the oil filter couldnt be easier on Subaru. 

Depending on your size you can slide right under the crosstrek to reach the drain bolt for the oil pan. 

Or if you can't then drive the car up onto two stacked pieces of 2x6. That should give you the clearance to get the drain bolt to perform the oil change. 

You should be doing these yourself. One, it saves you money. Two, it will get done right; dealerships and shops can be pretty sketchy as you found out. 3. It gives you a sense of satisfaction. 

Now. Go out and get yourself an oil waste pan. A 5 gallon bucket with lid. A metric 3/8 ratchet set and some brake cleaner and get at that oil change. Harbor Frieght is your friend.

Don't do what you explained on doing above. Just leave the new oil filter in place and simply drain the oil from the drain bolt and refill the motor to spec. You will find that info in your owners manual. It will be around the 4.7 quart range.

Unfortunately about that check engine light. Since the case was overfilled by a lot and you drove it like that for a couple months there's a good chance you blew out the seals and fouled the spark plugs. Check that oil level again when it's stone cold to be sure it's not really overfilled if it is you want to get this sorted out right away.

The facts:

* He (or she, gender equality lol), definitely got interrupted mid heist. My alarm went off for either the window or the column. Made a mad dash before I even opened my door.
   * Because of that I suspect they didn't get farther than breaking the column. I've looked at the wires but I can't see too far in there.
* The engine stutters when I try to start the car, because of course she does (poor thing).
   * After they **VIOLATED** my poor car, I assume the column breaking is causing something to jam up? My best guess. What usually is the culprit when the ignition fails during these situations?
* Is that blue, light up ignition cover thingy somehow causing issues? It's supposed to cap over the ignition but it's social distanced away from it.

1nc8vpk,Car Rattling & RPM Gauge Jumping,"I bought a used 2010 Subaru Legacy a little over a month ago and within the first few days I noticed it the steering wheel would shake at around 60 MPH. A week ago the RPM gauge started jumping up and then falling back down while driving on the highway, which came with screech/squeaking sound and a jolt of the car. When city driving and low speeds, I sometimes also hear a rattling sound while on the gas.

I took the car to a AAA shop for a tune up and an inspection. They changed my oil, replaced my brake pads, flushed my power steering and brake fluid, and cleaned out some carbon buildup in the fuel system. 60 miles later and I'm still having the same issues.

Any ideas of what it could be and how urgent of a fix it is? It has a 2.5L engine, is automatic, and is at 143,343 miles.",1,1757389960.0,2,AskMechanics,1757532863,2025-09-09 03:52:40,2025-09-10 19:34:23,"42observer (Score: 1): Steering wheel shake while coasting at high speeds is usually bad tires or wheels that need balanced. If the tread is low enough to need replaced, that might be it. The source of the RPM gauge problem is harder to diagnose without being with the car, but the screech/sqeak associated with it is most likely to be a loose serpentine belt, either from being worn/cracked or from the belt tensioner loosening up. Most Subarus use a manual tensioner on the top of the engine that's quite easy to tighten yourself with basic tools if you look up some videos, but I would first make sure the belt does not need replaced. The rattle could be anything and may not be related to any of those issues, potentially a loose heat shield or catalytic converter, would need to hear it to know. 

The RPM gauge jumping with a jolt of the car sounds like it could just be normal high mileage jolty-shifting of the car, but it could also be a sign of a bad transmission. Your best bet is to find a reputable shop in the area, preferably an independently owned one that specializes in Subarus or Japanese cars that *isn't* the dealership. You may need to pay a diagnosis fee but it sounds like its worth it to find out everything that's going on."

Car was driving fine no pre-issues, literally drove my car an hour before no issues.

 On this one particular very short drive, started seeing white smoke coming from the engine (not extreme amounts) kept going as I was only two streets away from home. I was at a full stop going from gear 1 to 2 the clutch wouldn't come back up, had to flick it back with my foot, gears 2-3-4 were fine. The next switch from full stop 1-2 no issues. Opened hood at home and reeked like burning rubber, couldnt see the source of smoke. No visible leaks and all fluid levels were fine and nothing visible in exhaust.

Car still drives, no sticking clutch I haven't driven it far enough to replicate smoke but can smell burning rubber again within a 1 min drive at a max speed of 40-50kms. Cars pick up is a bit slower, I do not feel a difference in the clutch bite point, I do not feel slipping, the clutch pressure feels like it always has. 

1st mechanic said clutch needs a full replacement ($4.5k - am aware this is over priced )

The muffler shop said the connector is only sold with the secondary non-sensing catalytic converter, although the only issue is the leaking flex connector fitting. 

Due to being in New York State, they are only allowed to install the CARB-rated secondary non-sensing catalytic converter and braided flex connector, and the parts price alone is over $2k, plus one hour of labor. Upon questioning, I learned that the corporate office of this chain of muffler shops no longer allows the shops to weld or modify exhaust systems, which is why they quoted complete replacement. I'm told that 
 I should be able to easily and cost-effectively have an independent shop replace the leaking braided flex connector. Is this correct, and if so, how do I find a shop to do this repair? 

I can buy an entire EPA non-sensing secondary catalytic converter with the braided flex connector in a neighboring state for about $150.00. Still, I don't believe it would pass the NYS emissions inspection. Any input would be appreciated.

1ncm093,keep or sell,"it’s my first year of driving and i own a polo vw 1.2 2009 plate. 
It came with 40k miles on the clock, 1 previous owner and MOT and Service history seemed pretty good. 
It costed me 4.2 grand outright for the car.
£130 insurance a month no claims or anything 1st year.
a full tank costs me like £55 around that marker. Lasts me like 5-8 days depends if i’m working or going out which usually i am. 
To me it feels like it drinks petrol though but i also feel like most drivers have that same feeling. 

Well i’ve had the car for pretty much exactly 1 year now and i seem to be having a lot of problems. They aren’t massive problems like the engine but small continuous ones are adding up a cost!

so far without having a look at any receipts on top of my head it’s had 

- All the exterior lights got electronic problems. The bulbs never blow fuses so.
Sometimes i give the headlight a good whack and restart the engine and the headlight will work for a couple of days this method only works once then i have to get the perfectly okay bulb refitted / changed again.

- window switch had failed and the window was going up and down by itself leading to my window being stuck down completely for a week.

- My roof headlining has recently collapsed. 
I know it’s a pretty long and expensive repair so someone has stapled it up for me for now.

- handbrake readjustment and cable replacement 

- some form of pipe / tube i think it’s an air intake filter or some form of filter has a crack that has been taped over at the car garage.

- wheel alignment out of place 

- tie rod seized 

- wheel bearing seized 

-  bush and ball joints, shock absorbers, control arms, springs, rods all names i’ve heard when getting forms of my suspension changed constantly 

- the car garage told me my exhaust manifold is not doing so good. Just a matter of time until it’s needing a replacement.

- the outter layer of my exhaust is pretty much hanging off and corroded so hopefully no holes get made in the inner layer otherwise we’re going to have a expensive problem! 

- break pads worn were changed

- it’s also got a few small scratches and a small crack in the rear bumper ( my fault my driveway is tight reversing up a windy hill and i have no sensors and it’s pitch black and there’s a lot of walls so luckily it wasn’t big but it’s still not fixed ) but this was in my very first months of driving i haven’t done it again!

- sometimes i have difficulty when i’m at a slow to standstill speed my gear transmission will struggle to slot into gear 1 or reverse? I have to attempt a few times or reset my clutch and try again? really annoying especially if cars are starting to wait . 

I feel really deflated i don’t have the money or motivation to keep on fixing this car nor do i have same love for it i had in the beginning. 

I don’t know if i hit bad luck with a car with a pretty bad conditioned underneath and should i just move on? 

my budget would be from whatever i get from selling this car and then saving for a year might result in me earning 2k. 
Therefore my budget may be 4-6k in 1 years time. 

I don’t really want to aim for a lower spec run around i would like to aim for the same grey area of car i own now but i’m not sure if a newer model that won’t cost me as much in repairs will be in my budget range as they seem to be selling for 8k minimum with medium-high milage in local garages. 
I see cheaper on Facebook market place yet some have high milage yet newer ages. Would it be worth to hunt on there for a lower milage vehicle or is it too much risk of being conned a bad car. 

So what should i do, should i keep this car or move on? Should i repair it or focus on saving money for affording a new aged car? 

i’m looking to get a car around the age 2014-2018 

I like VW polo’s, sport enhanced golf’s like GTI’s but that is out of my range i think maybe insurance wise also. i’m not a huge fan of a standard golf unless it’s a new spec which is also out of budget range. 
Seats i don’t mind.

Unfortunately I cannot advise the criteria or the guidelines as it’s against GDPR and company policy, however we do look at a multitude of things including the deal structure (instalment, deposit, term etc.) You can try and speak to the dealer and maybe look at some alternatives like different vehicle, different deal structure etc if you choose to, however this application at it’s current stage cannot be accepted unfortunately.""

Without knowing your personal circumstances, it could be anything. It could be a missed payment on your credit report a few years ago, a high debt to income ratio or a going concern about whether this car is affordable to you based on the information you provided to them.

1nctmib,A love letter to the Vauxhall Cavalier,"I have a confession to make, one that I know this is going to open me up to derision. This is going to be controversial but I have to say it, I absolutely love the Vauxhall Cavalier. So much so that I think it's one of the best family cars ever made and I'm prepared to defend that position tooth and nail.

I have a big soft spot for 90s cars in general, they are what I grew up with and have fond memories of seeing them on the roads. My parents had a couple of Vauxhall Cavaliers growing up and one of them became my first car when I was 17 in 2010.
I tired lots of other, more modern cars afterwards but I bought this Cavalier 6 years ago as I fancied trying another one out. I have since completely fallen in love with it. 

I love it's looks, understated and graceful, not aggressive yet respectable.

I love the big sofa like seats and the solid feel to the interior.

I love how you can weave through traffic, feeling like I'm a clear foot narrower than any other car on the road.

I love the fact that I can fit two child seats in the back and still have room in the boot for a pram, 4 suitcases, a child's mattress, a boot tidy box full of junk and a bucket and sponge so I can go on holiday and wash the car when I get there.

I love the fact that I can do 70mph in 5th at 2600rpm (exactly peak tourqe for this engine) and get well over 40mpg.

I love all the little features the designers put in to make it easy to work on. All the trim panels that have little cut outs in them just big enough to get a screwdriver in. The fact I can do a full service myself in under an hour and how much space there is round the engine.

I love how the engine delivers it's power and the sound it makes, muscular but unobtrusive.

It's fun to drive too. No not a sports car but once it settles into a corner it grips the road well.

Above all, I love the smile it puts on my face every time I drive it.

My first child was born in 2021 and at the time thought; 'right that's it then, it's been fun, time to buy a sensible car'. I put it off and I'm glad I did because it's been brilliant with kids. I now have two children and I appreciate it even more for the abuse it's taken. The longer I own it, the more I appreciate it.

1nctb58,Insurance policies - unsure what to do?,"Early August, someone scraped my car while I was at work and didn't leave any details (hit and run essentially). Thankfully, I had eyewitnesses who gave me all the details. When this occurred, I was with insurance provider X. The police told me to wait before notifying/claiming through insurance, so they can get more details from the liable driver like if they accept liability, who was driving, their insurance etc. Since then, my insurance with provider X has ended and I am now with provider Y.

Long story short, the police have contacted them and they've accepted full liability, but I can't get any details - it has to be my insurance who has to get them.

I contacted insurance provider X, who were okay with notifying them late anyway but said they won't pursue anything themselves unless I make a claim or the liable driver's insurance contacts them.

A) I don't know whether I should make a claim or not. Surely if it's not my fault at all, the other party should make a claim with their insurance and tell them they're liable (as they've told the police). What should I do?

B) I contacted insurance provider Y and told them all this. They said that my policy won't be voided or cancelled because the claim didn't exist then. But they said that if I do pursue a claim with provider X, I have to notify them and that my premium might change + I'll have to pay an admin fee too. Are they just trying to make money off this?

I have the opportunity to buy a 2009 Hyundai Coupe 2.0 manual,petrol for just under a grand who’s MOT history I’ll paste below. Insurance will cost me give or take 1k with a blackbox. I’m currently in my final year of university in Birmingham and live out which my parents are thankfully paying for and have a part time job in retail over the weekends. The car will be driven occasionally on weekends and/or to and from Birmingham maybe once or twice a month. However my dad might also use the car to commute 2-3 times a week in and out of Birmingham for work if needed (most likely not). 
Most people have told me to go for a smaller hatchback such as a Astra,i20, Golf etc. However these cost the same if not more to buy and insure as my initial choice of a 1 series around 5-6k which I was planning on getting sometime next summer.
Would it be a “dumb” decision to get a Hyundai Coupe at this age and for my desired purpose of “just having a car”.
I shall post the MOT history below.

Is a 2.0L engine a good idea for someone who’s just starting to drive? Probably not. If you’re saying your dad is going to commute 2-3 days a week and you’ll do less than that, I’m guessing your dad is going to be the policy holder and you’ll be a named driver which is why insurance seems fine.

If I was to go for it, what’s the best option, sell the RS and throw all the funds at it and finance the rest, or maybe get a loan for the rest, or perhaps do a Mercedes finance deal and keep some aside from the RS sale.

The latter I’ve not quite got my head around because you pay however much upfront then hundreds a month for X number of years to still not own it and have to have some big chunk final payment. Perhaps my lack of experience means lack of understanding there. Anyway thanks for getting this far and look forward to your advice.

Based on what you’ve said, I think option 1 or 2 makes the most sense. If you’re definitely going to keep doing that 400-mile round trip every 3-4 weeks, then sticking with diesel and going for option 2 is probably the safer bet. But if there’s a chance you might stop doing that journey (or do it less often), then option 1 might be better, since you could run into DPF issues without the longer runs.

So overall, I’d say the 1.5 TSI if you might reduce or stop those motorway trips, and the 2.0 TDI SEL if you’re confident you’ll keep doing them regularly.

Is this a marketing technique for the dealership, or is it an advertisement for Matt Armstrong?

When cold after a day it’s loud for maybe 1-2 seconds and it goes back to normal (I read that the chain doesn’t have any oil pressure and it builds up after some time so it’s a normal thing for these engines to do).

If we were to have a second child, I don't know how we would fit two chairs in, I'm not a particularly tall person, but I can't fit this baby seat or an infant seat behind my driving position.

I refuse to get an SUV, so I'm wondering if a bigger estate like an E-class is the way to go. I had a brief look at Ford Galaxy and that sort of 7 seater, but they don't actually seem to offer much more space?? Certainly with the 3rd row seats it means the boot is rubbish. That has me turning to van-based people carriers like the Merc Vito or Renault Trafic, which can seat 9 people whilst having a huge boot. I'm just not sure about safety and ISOFIX with those types of vehicle. I don't want to be thinking about a new car every time our family grows!

Since when did our stuff get so big that a C-Class estate isn't a sufficient family car? Anyone else been through this with 3-4 kids and cracked it without having a silly chelsea tractor??

With 3 kids on holiday trips (2 days journey to south of France) we use the outer 2 seats of 2nd row with middle seat down for dog crate or suitcases and one seat in back up and one down. That way no one is sitting next to anyone else,so fewer fights.

The height of the Sharan means you can stand suitcases up. When the 3rd row seats are used it opens up more space under the seats.

Old cars with average/higher mileage will likely have had all the wear and tear components replaced. A lower mileage car wouldn’t have met the mileage intervals to warrant those parts being replaced.

On top of that, I doubt the car has been serviced or at least had an oil change every year, as people only tend to go off miles for servicing, when intervals are miles *OR* months. So I’d be weary of a 20 year old car with only a few services, if that’s the case. Hopefully it has been serviced annually. 

I would also think the engine would have a lot of carbon build up if it’s only been used as a city run about. Hopefully it could just do with a blast down the motorway to get it properly heated and burn off some of the build up. But I’d take it to a garage to get a full carbon cleaning.

It was my first proper car and it was a joy to drive - not fast but the handling was a delight and paired very well with rwd and a manual (I'm not sure how the autos are). It also has a great timeless design and is a real icon of that era with the Altezza tail lights.

£6k, however, is lunacy. I know they are increasing in value as many of them get turned into drift missiles (they can be made to slide even with an open diff and only 150bhp). But they are slow, and the engine drinks an absurd amount for the low power. I don't really agree that parts are hard to find like the other commenter, but things may have changed since I owned one.

Crap on fuel for the power, parts are getting harder to find.

For £6k, you can get a much better IS250. There are no sensible reasons to choose an IS200 for £6k unless you really really like it."

It's the EX model so has some decent extras, and the 1.8 engine is superb. Smooth, quiet, reliable and actually very frugal too. 50mpg is easily achievable on the motorway.

Rust and corrosion are the killers, but it looks like that car has had quite a bit of work done in that respect which is a huge bonus.

1nc9vk7,2007 Toyota Yaris - Leaking AC?,"HELLO!

I’m hoping someone here has experience with this issue or can point me in the right direction.

I have a 2007 Toyota Yaris YRS NCP93R (FWD), and the air conditioning system is leaking water into the passenger footwell, and occasionally into the driver’s side as well. The leak is getting progressively worse and is now starting to affect my electronics (e.g., Bluetooth/radio).

Background:

* The car has never been in an accident.
* The issue began when it had around 45,000 km on the odometer (now at 65,000 km).
* Although it’s an older car, it was kept indoors for a long time and accumulated a lot of dust during that time. It was not needed by the previous owner and was fully functional when I purchased it.
* It did not have a cabin air filter installed from factory, and a food wrapper was sucked into the fan from the passenger footwell. I removed the wrapper and installed a cabin filter afterwards. This is when the problems began.

Symptoms:

* Water leaks into the passenger footwell when turning right, especially during sharp turns.
* Leak occurs only in warm/humid weather. It does not leak in winter. The hotter it is outside, the more water leaks into the cabin.
* The leak tends to build up and release suddenly, almost like pooling and dumping during cornering. 
* The AC used to make a ‘screeching’ sound before I replaced the AC Heater Fan Blower

What I’ve tried so far:

* Initially, I checked the AC drain pipe for blockages, and it doesn’t seem to be blocked.
* I took it to a Car AC specialist (Jack Frost Car Air-Conditioning) and they quoted over $2,000 to replace the entire AC system, which seemed excessive for a car with such low use and no damage.
* I worked with my grandfather (experienced mechanic) and we replaced the condenser and compressor – no improvement.
* Had it re-gassed – the tech who did this suggested the issue could be with the Heater Fan Blower.
* I replaced the AC Heater Fan Blower – this helped slightly but the leaking came back again once summer came back around.

I’ve seen a few posts about people having similar issues to this but none of the fixes seem to help. If anyone could link a post/forum which discusses this issue OR has personally dealt with this issue and knows how to fix it, I will love you forever.

Guess it depends a little on how bothered you are if the car is now fixed.

verone3784 (Score: 1): You're probably going to have issues with resolving this to your satisfaction, given that you've heavily muddied the waters by repairing the car yourself, rather than requiring that the dealer did it - which was their responsibility under the CRA. You have the option to both reject the car, and to request repair or replacement.

If they refused to take the car back, or repair it, then you should have pushed harder. A lot of dealerships do this to put people in exactly the position you're in right now, by delaying or stonewalling, then forcing them past the 30 day limit for the rejection to be resolved, which then makes the process more of a ballache.

A substantial amount of time has also elapsed since you bought the car. Your 30 day window for initial short term right to reject expired on June 15th, and it's now September 9th. At this stage you can continue to push, but you're more than likely stuck with the car due to inaction on pushing for the initial rejection, then repairing the car yourself, as the dealer can argue that you've basically accepted ownership of the car by investing in the repairs. 

At most, by filling out the N180, you may be able to fight through small claims to recover the cost of the repairs you paid for to get the car running and reliable again, but outside that I doubt you'll be able to force a rejection at this stage unless you've got a very good solicitor. 

Also, don't fill in the N180 yourself unless you know exactly what you're doing. If the dealer has sent this directly to your address, this is another tactic they use to try and fuck you in small claims court rather than sending it to your solicitor. People see paperwork, panic, and fill it out, usually badly or by not fully understanding it.

The N180 is a cornerstone of your claim in court, so make sure you know exactly what you're doing, or have your solicitor fill it out for you."
