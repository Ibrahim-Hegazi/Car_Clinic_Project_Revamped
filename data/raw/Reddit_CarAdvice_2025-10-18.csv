Turns out the guy that did the pad slap for me (I was busy doing something else awhile) never lubed up the guide pins or anything on the pads.

When someone pulled in front of me, I pushed on the brakes harder than normal and it of course had the pulsing but much faster and sounded not-so-good.

1o9gxwu,"2020 Toyota Corolla XSE: No e-brake engagement, can't reset","Hello Yall, 

I have done a stupid thing, changing the rear brake pad on a car with an electronic parking brake system, without doing any research beforehand... 

Here goes the story:

I did the rear brake pads on my Corolla without first setting the brake into maintenance mode. After replacing the brake pads, I realized I had messed up. At this point, the piston of the caliber were fully extended outward, I had to remove the electronic braking motor thing in order to engage it with a torx bit to manually rewind the piston back in. While in this process, it was really hard to get the piston back in, even when I tried to constantly rewind the piston back in. I decided to open the bleeder valve in order to get rid of some of the pressure, in hope that I could get the piston back in. Eventually, I was able to get the piston back in, with force on the piston, while simultaneously turning the torx bit clockwise, with the bleeder valve open. Once I got it back in, I was able to reassemble the wheel. Note that I also did a brake flush on this rear wheel, and I got all of the bubbles out of the line. 

Turned on the car, and I see the ""parking brake malfunction"" message. I tried to follow many procedures on how to reset the parking brake, but nothing seems to work. I'm able to drive the car and use the foot brake just fine; however, I cannot get the e-brake to engage, and the dashboard constantly has the parking warning (yes I also tried to disconnect and reconnect the battery, and I went to Auto Zone to tried to read for any code, and nothing showed up - AutoZone did not have a bidirectional OBD though, probably some basic one). 

===================================================================

Anyway, is there anything else I can do? I'm hoping the dealership has a special tool that can reset the e-brake for me, and there's not a much more serious issue.

1o9gx97,2003 Ford Expedition 4.6L running lean,"I've got an Expedition with the 4.6 Triton 2v that my friend bought from under a bridge for 1500 bucks with 200k miles. (Long story) We've been trying to get the thing cleaned up as it had a long list of codes stored in it when she bought it. I'm a bit of an amateur so bear with me.

It had a stored misfire, 2 evap leak codes, (fuel cap, gross leak) running lean on both cylinder banks, and an EGR sensor circuit code. I cleared codes and everything came back but the misfire. It sounded like it didn't want to crank and took a couple seconds to actually crank up, but once you got it running it runs fine, idles good and drives GREAT, apart from some hesitant initial acceleration coming out of park. It only hesitates out of park and not from any other stops if you keep it in drive.

I narrowed down the circuit code to a bad DPFE sensor and replaced that, and put a new fuel cap on it. Cleared codes and the long crank is now gone. Egr code and the evap leaks stayed gone after 15 miles. At this point its just running lean and still bogging down a little bit upon shifting out of park, but not as much as before. It doesn't bog down out of reverse at all after I replaced the sensor, it was before.

Initially I was fearing something was wrong with the transmission, but it being not as hesitant after replacing the dpfe sensor now has me second guessing myself. I was thinking about changing the transmission fluid (probably needs it anyway) but I'm wondering if its just bogging down because its running lean.

I was wondering where you guys think I should start with diagnosing this truck. I heard that the 4.6 likes to crack intake manifolds, so I was thinking that or even the manifold gasket. It is 20 years old. There is also a pretty bad exhaust smell at the rear so I was thinking maybe an exhaust leak before the cat? Maybe a gasket went bad?

Other things I'm brainstorming could be issue:

Failing fuel pump or injectors, clogged fuel filter

MAF sensor

Damaged plastic intake tubing

Curious on you guys' thoughts.",1,1760744792.0,2,MechanicAdvice,1760815969,2025-10-17 23:46:32,2025-10-18 19:32:49,"taschnewitz (Score: 1): First step is verify fuel pressure.

1o9gvvq,What is wrong with my car?,"I have a 2023 Hyundai Tuscon. About last November, the AC starting having issues. I’ve since taken it at least seven times to the dealership. They’ve replaced the sensor twice. They kept my car for a month this most recent time and as soon as I turned it on, still broken. 

So what’s happening is this: when I turn on the car, it’s a 50/50 chance the AC will be working properly. Half the time, it blows hot air for about 10 minutes and then will work but only after I’ve starting driving it at an accelerated speed for at least five minutes. Sometimes it takes longer. And when I say accelerated, I mean expressway speeds. Going slow, it takes even longer (20 minutes or more). 

Second, I’m always getting told that there’s ice on the road, the temp reads below freezing temperatures at times, or it’s off by 30 degrees or so. Or it will just go up and down ridiculously. 

What can it be? They literally have told me so many times they don’t know what it is and to pick up my car or that they’ve fixed it only for it to keep happening. 

Also, I don’t think I can file for it to be considered a lemon. It’s at 36,000 and the first time I went to get it fixed was at 28,000.

The hunting is likely due to vacuum leaks, probably from the pcv valve itself.

They applied a GM corporate assistance program. The notes are ambiguous though. It states that GM said the customer will cover 90% of the cost before tax (meaning GM only covered 10%); but then it also states that GM will cover around 95%.


You are *just* past the five year powertrain warranty based on that delivery date. Politely ask the service manager to fully goodwill the repair if possible. Otherwise have them double check that calculation."

While replacing the valve cover gasket, I noticed that the upper guide rail has broken into chunks. **(pic 2)** The car still runs, but has reduced power. Exhaust has a choppy sound at idle, and there’s a strong fuel smell. It has been driven in this condition for quite some time.

Before I proceed and order parts & tools I have some questions:

* Can someone confirm if my timing check looks correct **(pics 3–4)**? Does this confirm it has jumped?
* How likely are bent valves in this situation? Would the car be drivable if a
* Is a compression or leak-down test worth performing if the timing is off? How else can I determine the internal health before full commiting to this repair?

The bearing is roasted, but I can't figure out how pull it out because there is no way to get a hook onto the back of the bearing.

I'm happy to pull the whole adapter out, if that's the only way. And have a new adapter made that leaves room behind the bearing so a hook or something could pull the bearing out in the future.

Anyway, any ideas on how to pull the bearing and/or the adapter?

P0017 camshaft/ crankshaft error just came on. Is this due to previous late oil change? How to go about diagnosing before taking to shop? 


I own a 2019 Subaru Impreza, 75,000 miles. Recently I was driving and the check engine light came on. Read the code and it gave P0017 crankshaft/camshaft bank 1 position B. I’ve been doing some research, and I wanted to hear some quick opinions on how to go about diagnosing the problem , and what could have caused it. 

2 months ago, I got my oil changed, but before that I had accidentally skipped a change. I can’t believe it slipped my mind as much as it did, but I went from Nov 2023 - Aug 2025, 17,000 miles on non synthetic oil.

Is it possible that, even though I changed the oil 2 months ago, that the check engine light is coming on now? 

For diagnosing, I’ve read through this extremely helpful post [https://www.reddit.com/r/subaru/comments/18yr8sr/tsb_thursday_0216316r_inspection_and_repair/], and I am looking for advice on how to follow it.

Given the super extended oil interval, that would be my first suspect, clogged oil supply interrupting normal operation of the phaser.

The link is not working BTW.

If the problem is persistent, I would by start checking and cleaning externally accessible parts such as control solenoids.  Many have a screen that may clog but can successfully protect the rest of the circuit from getting clogged.

The catalytic converter doesn't care how much fuel is in it. It can cause the engine to have low power, hard starts or not start at all if it's plugged and it will get worse before it gets better. It won't fix itself until the next refill.

The starter doesn't care how much fuel it has either. Once the engine is running, the starter doesn't do anything and can't possibly cause it to stall.

The issue causing stalling after a fill up is in the evap system. These cars are notorious for bad purge valves. The problem can also be the carbon canister being flooded with fuel by overfilling the tank. You aren't trying to put more fuel in it after the pump shuts off, are you?"

Hello everyone,

I'm currently fixing my boat, am at the end trying to make the engine work.
It hasn't start for ten years before today actually, I did all the basic stuff, filters, oil, clean the fuel tank etc...
I'm facing a serious issue and I'd like to confirm a diagnosis.

The Symptoms:
 
As soon as I start the engine, it immediately revs up to maximum RPM (4000 on the tach).

The stop button on the panel does not work. The engine keeps running.
The only way I can shut down the engine is by manually closing the main fuel valve from the tank.


Checks I've already done (engine off):


Throttle Lever: The external throttle lever on the injection pump (where the cable attaches) moves freely and springs back to the idle position correctly. It is NOT stuck.

Stop Solenoid: I can hear the stop solenoid ""click"" when I press the stop button (with the ignition on). The external lever it's connected to also seems to move freely by hand.


It's not runaway: Since I can stop it by cutting the fuel, I know it's not burning its own oil.


My Diagnosis:


My thinking is that the internal fuel rack (the ""crémaillère"") inside the injection pump is seized in the ""full fuel"" position.

This would explain why:

The engine revs to max (it's getting max fuel).

The external throttle lever does nothing (the internal rack is stuck).

 The stop solenoid ""clicks"" but can't stop the engine (it's not strong enough to move the seized rack to the ""zero fuel"" position).

Does this diagnosis make sense to you all? Is there anything else I should be checking before I declare the injection pump needs to be removed and sent to a specialist? It cost some money ( Unfortunately boats cost money lol)

So i enabled the forced regen, had white smoke at the start and was happy. But after in the combustion phase, the DPF temperature topped at 537 degrees celsius (way to low to an efficient regen).

If it comes out wet after you fill the port with your PEA solution and wait a few minutes, then the valves weren't closed enough (or are leaky).

And if you're doing PEA treatment on the heads you might as well also do it on the cylinders.   So you want them full of PEA solution as well.   Because if it's a GDI engine and the heads are a mess full of carbon, the rings probably are too.

You're going to want to blow out the cylinders when you're done anyway just in case, and change the oil.

1o93c1y,Can I remove/reinstall/torque one lugnut at a time while the weight of the vehicle is supported by the tires?,"Ok -- so dumb question but my edge's lug nuts are swollen and warped; learned that last weekend *trying* to do a tire rotation. A couple of them I just couldn't get off -- the socket kept slipping around the 6-point, and I'm not reasonably certain it was ever the correct size due to what ford's stupid lug nuts do.

My plan this weekend is to get the old ones off in favor of a set of solid Dorman nuts. I expect it to be a weekend of cussing and frustration. One of the things that I would like to skip doing is fiddling around with raising the car just enough so that the wheel is touching the ground but not supporting the car so I can loosen the lugs. I do thus normally when doing a tire rotation before raising it to jackstand height, but that's with a known process. In getting the warped lugs off I might be putting weird angular torque on the lugs as well as having the car on the jack for much longer than I would for simply loosening 5 lugs in good condition.

As such I'm wondering, if I just do one lug at a time, do I have to raise the car?

1o9cdfq,lock glitch issue in 2013 Toyota Camry,"Hello, I’m not a car person so hoping people will understand this post anyway and if anyone has a similar experience they can share. 

For the last 2 years I’ve been dealing with a really annoying issue with my 2013 Camry. It’s some type of glitch in the inner security system that acts up and causes me to be unable to start the car. It started as an issue where I noticed that the key fob was no longer able to unlock the doors, so I went to a mechanic and, because of how expensive it would be to correct all the doors, we had him just replace the drivers side and have the other three locked and unlocked manually. At this point, the issue had happened before, but it just seemed like a glitch that went away within a few minutes. Basically, what happens is the noises will be a little different when I unlock it (instead of the initial multiple beeps, it sounds just the ones you’d hear if you pressed unlock while it’s already open). This is what indicates that I potentially might have a problem, as it usually also sounds a little different in the day or two before it starts. Then, when I get inside, I know whether or not I’ll have a problem based on what happens when I shut my door. If no noise occurs, I can start my car as normal. If an alarm sounds (7 beeps) then I know my car still registers as being locked. At this point I continue to press unlock on the key fob and again, it will only sound as if it is already unlocked, although the system does not think so. I try pressing the lock and unlock buttons on the doors, I close and open each door, which results in the actual alarm sounding, and I try manually unlocking the drivers side with my key. None of those usually do anything to make it stop, the only thing that consistently works is just constantly pressing unlock on the key fob until it miraculously registers that I’m unlocking the car. This has taken anywhere between 2-35 minutes to work. This has happened about once every few months, with the longest times being around once or twice a year. 

Has anyone else dealt with this issue? If you have any advice or experience, please let me know ",1,1760733136.0,2,CarHelp,1760815969,2025-10-17 20:32:16,2025-10-18 19:32:49,"Gunner_862 (Score: 1): Hi,

In the period that this problem has been happening, have you tried replacing the battery in your key fob with a new one? The reason I ask is that is probably the cheapest and easiest thing to try. With some cars, as the battery in the fob gets weak, the range of the fob also decreases until you have to be right next to the car to unlock it. 

Hope this helps!

If that’s the case.  It’s part of your problem.  The system monitors the front door lock positioning.  If it doesn’t see the lock go to unlocked. It may not tell the security system to disarm.   Causing a whole cascade situation.  I’ve seen the system do strange things when the locks don’t work.

I have also had a CEL pop-up for downstream 02 sensors, and after two sets of sensors, I have been informed it's an ECU-related issue, so to fix it, I was told to get a new ECU and get it flashed.

Now, the newest issue I am facing after installing new wheels and tires is a significant vibration at 120 km/h+ (75 mph+). For context, I put on 19"" Enkeis of a G37 Coupe, and I have had them inspected again for bends or cracks and had them rebalanced as well, and the vibrations still won't go away. Yes, I know the Enkeis are staggered, and I have them set up on the car accordingly, so that's not the issue here.

Do y'all have any idea why that vibration is happening, because it's driving me insane, and I'm genuinely on the verge of selling the car and looking for something else. The whole reason I got a 2IS was because it was supposed to have the Toyota reliability, but in my case, every other week, I'm paying 1-2k for some sort of repairs.

Make sure the fuse in the meter is good for 10A or more. Expected current isn’t this high but lower rated fuses may blow depending on current draw. Turn lights off, radio off, hvac off, basically everything to off setting, no auto. Keep keys away from the vehicle (more than 10 feet), open driver and passenger doors, use screw driver or similar to close the latches so the truck thinks they are closed (this is to allow the modules to go to sleep).  Monitor the current on the meter, could be as high as 500mA and could take up to 45min for all modules to sleep, the current reading should start falling as modules go to sleep. After this time has passed, see what the current reading is on the meter. Should not be higher than 50mA. If it is, then you start pulling fuses to see which one drops the meter reading down to 50mA or less. This will narrow down the circuit that’s causing the drain, then you can dig into what is causing it. Be sure to locate the fuse boxes first and avoid opening other doors, tailgate or bringing the keys close, this will wake modules and you’ll have to start again.  It’s possible that there is an update for a specific module due to it causing a parasitic draw, but you’ll be able to search specifically for it once you know what module or accessory is causing the drain.

So can I maybe get some help on this? Warranty is called Veritas Global Protection and so far I’m seeing really bad reviews. It’s been a month since my truck failed and I haven’t gotten it fixed. Warranty seems to be unresponsive sometimes and it has been a hassle trying to make calls every days 

Hello, so right now it has been 1 month since I’ve been trying to get my tuck fixed and I haven’t gotten to any type of agreements. My car broke down 3 months ago and after going through 2 accidentes and then the engine braking I had to take it to the junkyard. I had finished paying it off but it broke down and had to get something else to get moving.

I didn’t have any other choice at the time so I had to go out to a used car dealership to get a new vehicle. I went in and financed a 2017 Chevy Tahoe. It’s a 120,000 mile Chevy Tahoe that at the time I thought I had no other choice and couldn’t find something that I liked for me, my wife and my baby. It was big enough and the truck looked to be in good condition. Ended up financing it for $36,000, no down payment, $700 a month with a $5,000 warranty plus 36,000 miles for any service. Probably not a very good choice but I literally didn’t have the time to think. I can see that maybe now I could have went to get something new and with less payments but I guess if got fkd. 

So now, it’s been 3 months or 4 since I financed the vehicle. 2 months after financing, the truck stopped working and I couldn’t drive it. Took it to the mechanic and they said a noice could be heard from the engine. Got the information to the warranty after not answer it for days. Warranty had sent out an inspector but later said that they didn’t received the information that they needed from the dealership after the fact that they had sent out an inspector to do the job. Inspector stated that engine noise was present and that something had to be done about it. 

Right now it’s been a whole damn month without getting a fix to my vehicle. The warranty company didn’t not answer for the first couple days to weeks and I couldn’t get any type of process to be done. They were asking for a leak down test and some other diagnostics, I called the dealership where I have my truck and told them that the warranty was asking about those tests, dealership didn’t understand why they were asking for those tests because there was an engine noise present and they wanted to do a tear down to check the problem. 

Have called the warranty and the dealership countless of times to see what’s up with my truck and the dealership wanted confirmation from the warranty company to continue with the tests and for the most part, warranty didn’t answer for days. They never answered to the emails that were being sent until I was able to reach out to them. After them asking for diagnostics and a leak down test I finally had the dealership do them and now the warranty complained that they didn’t get the information that they needed and that they needed another leak down test to be done. I don’t want to pay for another leak down test and more diagnostics, from what the dealership has said, this is an engine problem that needs to be fixed and the engine needs to be taken apart to see what the real issue is. 

Warranty does not want to do that and they want another test to be done but I do not want to pay for something that is not even needed. I talked we the guy I financed the vehicle and he literally said the same thing that the dealership is saying, that they don’t understand why the warranty is asking for all of this if there’s a problem with the engine.  

So going of the emails, here the warranty says that… 
“The verification of failure youi sent in does not show where  the  air is going.  We are unable to read the percentages . The engine mounts show no failure , that is why we had requested a torque test .. At this time  we will need you to send verification of failure with readable measurements , and describe to us where the air loss is coming from .  top end bottom end . Engine mounts show the torque test being done  engine will move if they are bad . Put your foot on the brake and  rev it once or twice forward and reverse , it should show movement .”

Then the dealership sent this email out… 
“I am seeking clarification regarding the purpose of the leak down test, as the primary concern appears to be an internal engine noise, which has been confirmed by the adjuster during their inspection. A leak down test typically identifies and isolates engine cylinder issues by measuring air loss and is often used to evaluate compression loss or address concerns such as oil consumption or misfires. Could you please clarify why this test is being requested in this case?

The tech stated the engine is knocking on the left side and has a possible failed lifter which is also causing poor engine running, which was advised. We should be doing a tear down and taking it from there. 

Additionally, the technician has already performed this test per your previous instructions and the customer is being charged, which once again we will do as requested. 

Regarding the motor mount, I am in the process of obtaining the necessary video; that will not be an issue.

Please note that the vehicle has been here for 26 days and is still ongoing.”

So can I maybe get some help on this? Warranty is called Veritas Global Protection and so far I’m seeing really bad reviews.

1o96pqa,96 BMW E36 328is fuel trims,"Hey guys, 
I’m back asking another question about you guessed it fuel trims yaaay. 
Been really struggling trying to find what is actually wrong with my car.
I have attached pictures that show what the fuel trim is at while idling (first pic) and while revving (second pic) the negative fuel trims only get worse while driving sometimes reaching up to -26 while going 65mph on the highway. (can’t show cause can’t hold phone and take pictures while driving)
I’m really just asking for any sort of help in this matter. 

Things I have replaced:
MAF Sensor (the car wouldn’t even run and idle on the old one)
I have cleaned and refitted the idle control valve 
I believe I’ve fixed all vacuum leaks I can find (I used vacuum line to replace all vacuum lines under the intake manifold)

Things I have noted: 
I have a new fuel filter just been to lazy to replace (will do soon) 
I have seen my car throw a misfire code due to a coil pack and will also be replacing soon.
The live data for the O2 sensors seems to be within operating range and they have always passed the smog check that my scanner can run.
Another thing to note so far the LONG TERM fuel trims have never ever gone above positive or negative 10.
This behavior is synonymous with the MAF sensor just even being unplugged.
I have also tried unplugging the battery for a while and replugging to see if it was just running on the old sensor data.

Questions I have: 
Can a bad coil pack lead to bad fuel economy and this weird fuel trim issue.
If not is it possible that my new MAF sensor is bad? 
If so how can I test this?
If unplugging the battery has resulted in the ECU wiping its data and it needs new sensor data, then wouldn’t this problem just sort itself out? 

Thank you guys for your time reading.

I went to Take 5 to get my oil changed for my 2015 Lexus GS 350. They did a coolant test and relayed to me that it would be good to replace my coolant. My car is nearing 100k miles so I thought it would be a good idea to get it done. The cost was $145 for the coolant change. However, I was researching a bit to understand how coolant affects your car and found out that you must put in the recommended coolant in the Toyota/Lexus. 

I drove back to Take5 to discuss this with the workers there and they pretty much relayed to me that they do this in Range Rovers, Mercedes and other Lexus with no issues adding that if car is not overheating, it’s fine. I offered to buy the correct coolant and asked if they would change it for me to which they replied that they are not allowed to and to talk to their manager on Tuesday. 

I care about the long term effects and longevity of the car. I am okay with the current Take 5 coolant which is a Shellzone MV AF/C 50 DR? If they decline to change it, should I chalk it up as a learning moment and take it to a mechanic to get the coolant flushed and replaced with recommended coolant?

It’s not very drivable and hasn’t been since the second day of ownership- it’s been in the shop 14 times, and it’s been in for long durations as well. I have lost about 30,000$ on it at this point. Maybe more. It also wasn’t road tested for safety, but they checked it was- it had tires so bald they were white. They refused to put them on. When I bought the vehicle I immediately got new tires as it was unsafe- but I thought the only thing I was out was tires with this one. I had NO IDEA I was getting absolutely slaughtered

1o9h0d0,Did my mechanic lie and is this new grease?,"
- I had an appointment specifically to check the issue with my left front wheel making a weird sound and requested an ABS or brake system CHECK (along with a few other fixes which were performed), which I paid for. However, I was never told what the actual problem was with my wheel making the sound after the service, and the sound persisted, so it’s doubtful the check was properly performed.  And my airbag sign came on on my dashboard which they caused after replacing my steering wheel. 

- Communication was extremely poor during both visits. Despite repeated calls asking for updates, I was given no clear information on when my car would be finished. The promised completion dates were missed by several days with no proactive updates or explanations about the delays.

- For the second visit, they promised to check the left front wheel issue again for free, because I already paid for it prior, but after inspection, they quoted me for replacing wheel bearings on both front wheels, even though the problem was only with the left wheel.

- They only replaced the left wheel bearing, but upon pickup told me the noise was caused by a loose grease cap, meaning either they misdiagnosed or lied about the need for wheel bearing replacement.

- I paid for a wheel bearing replacement that was unnecessary and did not fix the sound, so the problem remains unresolved.  It's making the exact same sound from the beginning.  So I imagine they didn't perform any test drives whatsoever, and just told me the problem was the wheel bearings. 

- They did not warn me in advance about the loose or damaged grease cap, which is important for me to know to make arrangements or consider driving risks.

- It appears they did not perform a proper road test after repairs because the noise is still present post-service, which should be part of any competent brake system or wheel check.

These failures in service quality, communication, diagnosis accuracy, and honesty have caused me inconvenience and expense without resolving my issue. I am seeking a refund for the unnecessary wheel bearing replacement and expect proper resolution. If not, I will have to escalate this complaint to the Maryland Attorney General or appropriate consumer protection entities.

I brought it back into the mechanic who did the oil change and he checked things out said he couldn’t find anything.

-oil change was done by a reputable mechanic and not a jiffy lube type place

Noise didn't go away, but they told me everything looked good so I figured it wasn't a huge deal and just dealt with it. About 6 months later, I had some rear suspension issues and took it to a local shop and told him about the front end noise I was hearing. He replaced a good amount of parts on the front end and rear end totaling up to 1800. Rear noise went away, but the front end noise was still making the same noise when turning left. He also told me everything was fine so I again put it off (mostly because I don't have a ton of money after paying 1800). Now 5 months later, I went into another shop, gave them the list of what had already been replaced and told them to please only fix it if they were 100% sure it was the problem. So they replaced something else, this cost 600 dollars. Noise still didn't go away. I'm now down 2400 dollars and don't know what to do. I don't have money to just be throwing away, but I'm tired of this noise and just want it fixed. I'm going to go back to the same shop on Monday, but what can i do to avoid paying hundreds or even thousands more just to not fix the problem?

This is a built-in safety feature, as the car assumes the issue might still exist until it's manually verified and cleared.

To reset the airbag light, you'll need a diagnostic tool that can specifically access and clear SRS codes — most basic OBD2 scanners don’t support this function. Some auto parts stores offer free diagnostic scans, but they typically can’t clear airbag codes due to liability concerns. If you want to handle it yourself, you could buy or borrow a scanner that supports airbag systems (like a FOXWELL NT630 or Launch CRP123), which would allow you to clear the code as long as there are no actual faults remaining.

Needed new rear brake lines, along with a couple other smaller things. I got those resolved pretty quickly. Now I'm just on electrical (again).

***So here's where I'm at:***  
Car doesn't start, and only has a clicking noise. All of the electronics would shut off immediately after attempting to start. It would only start after a boost, and then after shutting it off it showed no electrical power until boosted again. While revving / driving the cabin lights flickered.

I replaced the battery, but within about 4-5 hours the battery was completely dead. So there's a HUGE draw.

When I purchased the vehicle, the original owners said they had replaced the Alternator, and the starter.

Suspected the IBS maybe had some issues, so I re-registered the battery, didn't fix the problem.

Noticed the Battery Safety Terminal was disconnected, so I bypassed it completely. Soldered a 2ohm resistor in to kill the airbag warning.

***Main Draw Tests:***

I went through and did more extensive testing with a multimeter connected in series with the negative on the battery (after a full re-charge). Initial readings were around 3-6A with the ignition off (and key 50ft + away).

I pulled all the fuses in the front Fuse Box - No change

This is what I did with the rear fuses / modules.

Removed the MPM - Drop of 1A

Removed the Hi-Fi Amplifier - Drop of .5A

Removed the Starter Relay - Drop of 1.5A

Removed the TCU - Drop of .5A

After doing all this, I was still seeing a draw of 1.9A

I unplugged the alternator's main cable and control plug, didn't see any significant drop. I have yet to run more extensive testing with it, so it may still be the problem? Unsure.

Here are some codes the vehicle is throwing:

I have changed the PCV valve, given it a tune up. Did a liqui-moli engine clean, cleaned my fuel injectors with some additives, pretty much tried to do everything I could think of outside of rebuilding the engine. I slowly went up in viscosity because nothing was helping. Now the viscosity I use is 10w-40 and it slowed it down a bit, and I add Lucas to it. I don’t even know if that’s healthy for the car lol.

before I did this, my catalytic converter got fried and a mechanic replaced that for me and only found out it was burning oil like crazy. the car itself actually looks really good because I got it painted recently at a good auto shop and it has cross bars. I’m thinking of selling the car because maintenance wise it’s horrible. I’m planning to lease a car through uber because I put like 5-6k miles a week on the car and it justifies leasing through uber at that point in my opinion.

So I guess, can you guys think of anything I can do to eliminate the oil burning? I want to either keep this car, or get an old toyota corolla since I assume the maintenance would be way less on that. I’d keep it as a back up car because I’m leasing an electric car through them, but some weeks when I’m not doing uber, you can return the lease and save money on it. So a back up car for the weeks im not putting 5k miles on it makes sense.

I recently had the battery changed on my 2015 Ford Explorer XLT. There were no issues prior to the change. 
Upon starting the car after changing the battery the parking brake light and traction control lights came on and when I started to drive it, it started sputtering when I would give it gas and didn’t want to go. I took some internet advice and let it run in idle for a while and rev the engine some to restart the PCM and then it started driving normal again. I was under the impression that driving it would turn the lights off eventually because the people who changed my battery said it’s common. After about two weeks the lights are still on. I’ve been back to the place that changed the battery and had them attempt to clear the codes. They also tried holding the positive and negative together for a few minutes to get it to reset. Lights stayed on. They asked me to bring it to a ford dealer to have it scanned and if it was battery related they would take care of it. 
After doing so the ford dealer has told me that the ABS and the HCU module are both faulty and the HCU module cannot be replaced because it’s obsolete. 
I find it strange that after the battery replacement both of these modules are reading faulty and think it has something more to do with some kind of voltage or electrical issue. 
I’m just looking for other opinions on someone who has maybe ran into this issue before or knows what my next steps could be to try fixing this issue, or if you think it really is both modules failed.

Hey all,

I’m thinking about changing my car because my current one is getting expensive to run. I drive about 1,600 miles a month, mostly on motorways and country roads (not much city driving).

I prefer SUVs, but I can’t use a plug-in hybrid because of my living situation (no charging point). I was also looking at a Toyota Auris Hybrid – I know it’s not an SUV, but I like the reliability and fuel economy.

Right now, I have a 2011 Nissan Qashqai (petrol, 30 mpg), so it’s about 15 years old and not very fuel-efficient.
I’m wondering if it’s worth keeping it for now or upgrading to something newer and more efficient.

1o9dc76,Mis-sold service plan,"Evening,

Just after a bit of advice about a service plan I was sold when buying my car in January 2024.

I bought it from a JCT600 VW approved used and went for a 2 year service plan at £20.50 per month that was stated as including:

• 1 x minor service 
• 1 x major service 
• 1 x pollen filter 
• Free visual health check

I bought the car online, my local VW chain is Johnsons who I'd be using to carry out the services in the plan.

I had what I'd assumed was the minor service completed last year, which was an oil change and inspection. However today I went to go have the major service completed and all they've done is another oil change, inspection and a pollen filter change. They've then listed a few things that need 'immediate attention':

• Brake fluid
• Spark plugs
• Front differential oil change 
• Air filter change

For all of the above, they want a further £400. I pointed out to the service advisor today that surely all of these are covered under a major service, however was told the service plan only covers 2x oil changes and inspections.

Now I'm just looking for reassurance or someone to tell me I'm wrong, but does it not seem like I've been completely mis-sold the service plan? Just to confirm, the dealership I bought the car from handled all the paperwork for the service plan so I never actually saw the contract and what it says is included, however I do have a physical copy of the dealership advertising saying it includes 1x major and 1x minor service.

If I'm wrong then I guess I've just paid nearly £500 for 2 oil changes...",0,1760735396.0,1,CartalkUK,1760815969,2025-10-17 21:09:56,2025-10-18 19:32:49,"karlos-the-jackal (Score: 3): Is this an official VW service plan or a dealer one?

1o9d6ct,Best estate for 15k,"All,

Looking to upgrade the fiesta to something with significantly more space, that’s also better suited to majority motorway driving. Definitely want to maximise comfort as much as I can too.

Currently have my eyes on 2020 Skoda superb estates with the 2.0 TDI engine, sitting around the 80k miles mark.

Is this a good solid choice? I cover around 7k miles a year, and want a strong engine that can yield me cheap results on long motorway runs. I’m also after a little more ease with overtaking etc, would remapping this engine to a stage 1 be a really bad idea? 

Or would going a little older and longer mileage on something like an A6 or touring BMW be a better shout? Perhaps with a larger engine that won’t be too expensive to fuel or insure?

Many thanks in advance!

This is PROBABLY what it’s for.  Crucially, note that Mercedes do not have your interests at heart. They - and all dealers who committed this fraud - will be trying minimise their costs, and so are likely to be proactive and try to get people to accept less than what they’re really owed.

1o9beh7,BMW Approved Used - Be Wary,"Hi folks, sharing a cautionary tale.

In February I bought a used BMW via their approved used scheme. The dealer was about 250 miles away from where I live, but I was assured that I could use my local dealer for any warranty issues.

I noticed the car makes a small squeak sound when you slow down/speed up to/from about 10 mph. I took it to my local dealer (Arnold Shark unfortunately). They messed with the rear brakes, which are now binding as a result.

I told them this and asked them to fix it, they replied that 'brakes aren't covered under warranty'. I clarified that I am asking them to remedy their mistake, they refused.

I contacted BMW UK, who contacted the dealer again, and replied 'they have made their final decision and it is unchanged. they are independent businesses so there is nothing we can do'. They suggested as an alternative I could take it to the dealer I bought it from for them to investigate the original squeak noise (still unfixed)!

So here I am about 4 months down the line, now with two problems, wishing I had never taken it in, and soon to be out of pocket to fix both. Do not assume approved used gives you any sort of benefits. It seems BMW give franchises out for fun and doesn't care what folks do with them.

You are quite right to consider that accidents are likely to happen within the first year or two, and thus to have something where a little external cosmetic damage won't be the end of the world.

I'm a manual learner driver and I take weekly sessions in Newcastle around West Jesmond with my instructor. The car is always with a clear ""L"" sign at the back.

However, at the moment when the light turned yellow, immediately in millisecond the car behind me BEEP BEEP BEEP\~!! I was so stressed already that when I lifted the clutch, the car stalled the next second. This guy behind me suddenly repeated his honking while I start the car again and from the mirror, he appeared to be literally shouting, his hands were in weaving fists, and he accelerated his car so tightly to my bumper. At least 2-3 other cars behind me were repeatedly laying on the horns for seconds after this angry man sounded the horn. All of these happened within about three seconds when the light turned yellow.

Thankfully, my instructor was calmed enough. He opened the window and waved to drivers behind me to use the other lane. Then he helped me to successfully got in the first gear and move. But when the driver behind passed from my side, I gave him a hand gesture of bowing with hands (expressing embarrassment), he pointed to me with his finger and his eyes were very angry and he looked like he was about to punch me.

I noticed some other drivers including him were immediately flooring the car and merge back to my lane not using their indicators and some of them looked at me with disgust(No clues). There was a driver put a middle finger on his face, also no clue where that sudden anger comes from.

1o8yv7c,Breakdown-  mystery misfuelling?,"Bought a second hand Volvo V40 through Arnold Clark two years ago, nearly 10 years old so the warranty was short, but with a very low mileage I thought it would be a good deal.
It's had a wee issue with the start stop function where it stalls and the engine makes a funky noise. There was no warning lights coming on and I was able to turn off the start stop, so I just hadn't gotten round to having it checked out. Nothing had been flagged in MOTs or services. 

I broke down on the motorway on Monday, the car started to slow down and after pulling over into the hard shoulder would not start- the engine would start, stall, start, stall, over and over again.
AA came over, the guy did some basic diagnostic and said there was no fuel pressure, the car would have to go to a garage.

Garage calls to say they aren't able to find a fault in their 1hr diagnostic so they need £230 to do a more in depth full diagnostic. I get a call from them telling me they've found petrol in the tank (it's a diesel car) and they need £730 to do a full drain, clean, filter replacement and then they can check if there's damage to the pump and injectors.
Now, I am 100% certain that I did not misfuel when I topped up two weeks ago,  I've driven around a fair bit since then too. I went back to the petrol station where I fuelled up just to check that the nozzle I very clearly remember using was a diesel one. It was. I am absolutely baffled. I have never misfuelled because I know what a big issue it can be. 

I don't know a lot about cars, so this all makes me feel incredibly overwhelmed. I phoned the garage to ask for more information- how much petrol was in there? could it have been there for a while? is there a chance there's been misfuelling damage to the car that predates me? 
The guy was not very friendly and seemed kind of defensive about it all, despite me telling him I trusted their diagnosis, I just needed more information because I feel like I'm going crazy. 

I feel like I'm stuck with this garage because moving the car which can't start to another garage seems like too much of a hassle, but I just don't know what to do.

In terms of value and quality they’re very good though. Cost is cut in the right places so they’re reliable.. but wear cosmetically faster than other cars"
1o8ow2p,"I'm truly devastated about scrapping my car, do other people experience this?","Its time for my '94 audi 80 tdi to go. And I'm absolutely miserable, i didn't even eat the night I made the decision that enough is enough. Do I need some sort of therapy? Is it because its been with me a third of my life? Maybe i just need to vent my feelings out. Long story incoming.

Iv always been mad for 90s cars but mostly the VW mk2 golf and corrado, at the time not Audis so much, but it looked cooler than anything else I could afford at the time.

I bought it last minute in 2014 for £650 from a very shady gentleman in a rough town, because id just got a job 40 miles away and couldn't afford to run my petrol cars there and back, I was only 22 and on poor wages. 
The plan was to use it until the 11 months MOT ran out while I saved for something supposedly more reliable, and then scrap it.

The guy who sold it was honest enough to say he bought it from a nurse who used it to get to work and back for the last 10 years, she did NO maintenance other than MOT fail work.

MOT time came and i'd done 0 work to the car, just put fuel in. I'm a mechanic so got half price MOT's at work, so I just thought there's no harm in trying. The strictest tester at my place got it, and it genuinely passed with ease. Just headlight aim needing adjustment.

So I did a full service, brakes and tyres, ran it another year, took it to the 2015 british GP and it ran without fault, then passed MOT again, easy as you like. At this point I checked the cambelt, torn slightly in 3 places and cracking, probably from since I bought it. So I put a new kit on.

By now I was hooked. It felt like the fuel gauge never moved, it would sit at 80mph with ease on the motorway once upto speed, acceleration was just slow. And the auto box was silky smooth for a 4 speed 90s box.

By 2017 the diesel pump was rough, I had to put idle revs on myself or it would almost cut out and the engine would be so juddery it felt like it was breaking the mounts. But under load at speed in drive it was fine, just no idle. I battled traffic with this bad idle for 3 years, but still, it passed MOTs and got me to the 2017 British GP, and all over the UK really, with just me doing basic services. 
The only fault being a leaking auto gearbox line around 2018, obsolete part but I got a local company to make one for me.

After all this I decided id bit the bullet and treat the car, I put a new diesel pump on in 2020 that almost cost as much as the car did. I got 3 more years bullet proof running from it, all while my other cars, that i spent heavily on, kept breaking.

2023 began the Audis slow death. I live on the coast and rust had taken hold of the wings amd arches, the auto box was leaking, its 100% obsolete with no parts supply for it. 
Many other things started breaking and leaking now also. I tried and tried since then to keep it going, but as I fixed a part, 2 more broke. I got it through til now.

Last week the heater matrix went, it sprays coolant vapour up the windscreen so its just not driveable. Its not worth doing a dash out job with a time bomb gearbox and major rust. Plus all the other issues, I cant get bits for half of my faults now either. Its financially not viable.

Most people would have scrapped it over the diesel pump so I feel I dragged it through 8 extra years of life, and I knew this time would come, but now it has, I cant deal with it.
 I may be off with some of my years because there was a lot to remember, and forgive and spelling mistakes if I missed them.

If you managed to read to here, I just appreciate that my thoughts and venting got heard. Its just a disposable car that I got overly attached to and it hurts. I dont know many 'car people' that understand my feelings or would care, I might just be weird. But this made me feel a bit less sad. Thanks.

I added some photos of it in its glory years before the lacquer all burnt away or peeled off the plastic panels, and the wings rotted.
She really did look like brand new after some trim shine and a Polish 😢😭

Fun fact: even though I replaced the diesel pump in 2020, even as late as summer 2025, sometimes I catch myself holding revs on out of subconscious thought from 7 years ago.

Quick edit: to save me repeating the same replies, in regards to scrapping this, I planned to keep all the working spares for a replacement car with a serviceable manual gearbox, not just throw the whole lot away. Sorry this wasn't clear.

UPDATE: didnt expect this to blow up so much, I appreciate all the replies. However, not 1 person saying 'I can save this, op should sell it'  has followed through. Time wasters and dreamers are why people just scrap these old cars, everyone claims they will save it and then runs a mile when you actually offer them the car 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️",1087,1760666294.0,303,CartalkUK,1760815969,2025-10-17 01:58:14,2025-10-18 19:32:49,"SlowRs (Score: 313): I bet someone would pay for it still.
