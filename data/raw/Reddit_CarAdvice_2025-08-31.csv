1n4g6vb,"Does this coolant hose appear to be where a leak may be occurring? (2010 BMW X3, N52 Engine)","I'm currently diagnosing a coolant leak for the first time and watching some videos for coolant leaks on the N52 engine, and this hose was mentioned as a potential source. I'm not sure what a properly working hose would look like exactly, but those bent rings (o-rings? not sure what it is exactly) appears bad to me. I have attached a photo of the other side of the hose, which in my opinion seems fine most likely.

I've seen pressure testers be used for diagnosing coolant leaks, but I don't have such a tool to use for testing and even after running my car for about 20 minutes with a drive to build pressure, I couldn't get the leak to happen again in that time.

I will continue with checking other potential leak sources, like the coolant tank or such, but I'm thinking this may be the leak source.

They are spring loaded and go through the fitting to lock in on the fitting. For a pressure tester, go to a parts store and get one of the loaner tools.

Another option is to add some UV dye to the system, then drive it around a couple days and then go hunting for the dye and the leak."

Ive checked the fuses with a multimeter out of the fuse box and changed them anyways even though the multimeter was beeping. The fuses I changed were both the Left and Right Taillights and also the one for the instrument cluster and shift lock. I knocked them out because they are cheap even though it didn’t fix my problem. Time to time my radio also likes to cut off out of no where, casually driving(no extra electrical input), when I’m turning my steering wheel, rolling windows down.

1n4fb26,2021 Crosstrek Battery Issue??,"Hello, 

Going to keep this as simple as possible because I don’t know shit about cars.

My problem: About 12 days ago, my car randomly died while it was parked at work, the physical lock is barely functional so i couldnt open it or pop the hood. A few days later I went to go figure it out on the weekend, luckily the lock worked and I got in the car, popped the hood and was gonna jump it. I literally touched the battery with my hand and my car turned back on and I drove it home, had no changes in sounds or function etc. 

The next day, at home, same deal, my car died again, couldnt get in with the lock. 

Now today (a week later of sitting in my parking lot) It was working fine again. I think it’s a parasitic draw or an alternator issue. Does anyone have a fuckin clue??

Oil changes are cheap engine work is expensive. (I’ve worked as a mechanic since 1987). 

danceparty3216 (Score: 4): Generally, the more frequent your oil is changed, the cleaner it is, the longer lasting your engine will be.
Of course you need to balance wasting money and destroying the engine. 

The OEM recommendation is to reduce its ‘cost of maintenance’ during the warranty period. Thats how long the manufacturer thinks you can go before the wear on the engine causes it to prematurely fail (statistics etc…) 
You will also find in the manual, the ‘extreme duty’ maintenance interval. Thats for long periods of idle or short drives, or for cars over 70k miles. (Kilometers)

You will find if you pay attention to your type of driving, you are more likely to drive in the ‘extreme duty’ section of the manual and you should follow the shorter oil change interval recommended by the manual and likely almost identical to the shop.

Unfortunately manufacturers often do not support changes to their maintenance minder interval - even when their own manual has a shorter recommended interval.

If your car is burning oil, or you loose oil between changes, a shorter interval is also a good way to not run dry and kill the car."

So, I have the money to buy it immediately, but people been telling me that it is an extremely expensive car to keep not only because of the Gasoline it consumes but also because if theres a problem with some car pieces and mechanism, it is very difficult to get the pieces (because of the year of the car) and they are expensive.

I just want to fix the turbo on the a3 for him to go back to normal performance and then I will have a car for maybe doing a little longer travels in Portugal without having to use the Dodge Stealth.

As you know well these cars are basically slightly detuned Mitsubishi GTO/3000GT, which is not just a pain to work on but are getting increasingly difficult to keep running because part support has completely dried up, unlike with Supra 70/80, and we relying on a shrinking pool of used parts to keep them working. To compound the difficulties as these cars age they are developing issues that are very much time consuming to diagnose because these cars were not designed to be still running in the Year of Our Lord 2025.

 as for the glitter, there's going to be some. Depends on the wear. You can get a brand new vehicle and have that too. I look at it this way, if there is no big chunks but just glitter, you should be okay. It's the wear on the gears.
If the car is running better, then make sure you just try to keep a eye on the fluid.

Symptoms:
- Very slow acceleration from 0 to 20 mph takes 10 seconds.
- Changing gears gets better after that and cat can hit 60 mph and keep that speed effortlessly. 
- Accelerating uphill is very difficult and it’s even unable to if the hill is steep enough.
Rough idling, shaking engine, shaking airbox.

Those ecoboost engines have some horrible reliabilty issues.

An average line is that they got a lot more performance per liter of displacement with each new generation of engine but by limiting environmental emission rules they have to cut cost somewhere and some engines cut the reliability by using oiled belts, smaller camlobes, thinner oil etc.
So they reduce the parasitic losses as much as possible and increase fuel economy/make sure they meet emission standards.

Just search the forums for common problems for the car you are looking for, get the car checked out before purchasing it. And keep it mind what could go wrong and how much $$$ its going to cost to fix.

The problem with mismatched tread designs is traction. Tires are designed to hold the road and move water out from under the contact patch (the area that is in contact with the road at any given moment). Different designs shed water at different rates. 

On wet roads, this makes the car unstable. Let's pretend one tire is able to pump out 2 gallons per second while the other is pumping out 1 gallon per second. As long as you only need to remove 1 gallon of water, there's no problem. But as soon as you reach the need to remove 2 gallons, you'll lose traction on the 1 gallon tire since it can't keep up. 

On dry roads, different rubber formulations and tread designs hold dry pavement differently. This won't really come into play while going straight, but if you have a hard corner, it might be a problem. If one tore can hold it, but the other can't, you'll likely spin out. Now, most people aren't hitting corners hard, so this scenario may not be an issue. But the holding ability of a tire also plays a big factor in braking. If you slam on the brakes in a panic stop, having one tire skid while the other holds can cause you to vere off to the side, spin out, and increase your total stopping distance. 

It's your car, so it's up to you if this is an acceptable risk or unacceptable.

I have a 2016 Nissan 370Z with 67k miles on it.
I would like to sell it or trade it in or whatever the best option is. 

Here’s the story and wrong decisions I’m sure I made.

The problem is it isn’t registered right now, I bought it 2 years ago @50k miles for $23k with a salvage/rebuilt title from an Arizona dealership when I lived in California, they shipped it to me and I paid the taxes and registration on it at the DMV. The DMV needed the title from the loan company (Westlake Financial) to give me my license plate so I requested it and the loan company said they would send it but it would take about 40+ days.. they claimed to send it but the DMV didn’t receive it and I slowly went back and forth between them and it never got resolved for a several months. I needed to transfer to Denver for work so I figured I would just register it after I moved. Moving was a process/ I got lazy/forgot, I eventually spoke with the DMV again who said that they were in the process of receiving my title, time passes and nothing. I call again and they tell me they don’t have my title and I have to go in person to the original DMV in California because the person on the line didn’t know what else to do… meanwhile that whole first year Westlake did NOT have a phone number that connected to a human, everything was automated and unhelpful including the website which wouldn’t let me create a login without an account number which I would find on the website after I logged in… (the emails from my payments didn’t have the full acct number). 

Maybe you can say I didn’t try hard enough or I’m just dumb for letting this go on so long but I never got pulled over in Denver so I kinda just let it be..


KBB puts it at $17-19k, I’ve never missed a payment and I owe about $13k on it still. The car runs fine, one headlight is out. No lights on the dash, I’ve replaced the rear tires and brake pads. But I still don’t have a license plate and have not paid to renew the registration. I loved the car while I had it but my girlfriend doesn’t drive stick and it’s our only car atm so I need to get a more practical one, at this point I don’t even care if I take a loss on it I just don’t want to owe anything. 

Carvana offered me $100 and some trade in sites won’t take it because of the title. I don’t know what to do.

Smooth house hold butter knives work well for wedges, slip one behind, then on top the 1st slip in another, then wedge a third between those two and you'll have the start of a good gap.

 Next, get a cheapo snap blade (they are long and narrow and sharp) utility knife, open it fully and start slicing the foam near the wedge.

After you cut deep into the gap, add more butter knives to force the gap bigger, other wise the foam in the tape will stop the knife from being able to continue slicing."

That being said, the interior was not mint (classic rip in the drivers seat and some glue on the headliner from a previous owner sticking lights up there). There is also a fair bit of rust around the wheel wells.

The way the used car market is right now, I think you'd be hard pressed to find an RSX in this good of a condition for less than this one is listed for. If everything is good with the engine, which it probably is because people who store their cars in the winter generally know how to take care of them, I'd say go for it.

I’ve noticed a quiet, muffled rattling or jiggling sound coming from the front drivers’ side wheel fender area (hear in video). It sounds like something loose, maybe a ball joint or bearing, and happens intermittently when I go over small bumps or turn the wheel to come out of a parking spot. It started a few weeks ago. It might be normal but I've never noticed it before.

For context, I had all of the following done at the shop 6 months ago:

* Wheel alignment, tire rotation, and vehicle road test to inspect suspension and steering
* Checked tire pressure, condition, and ride height
* Checked/adjusted caster, cambers, toe-in, centered steering wheel
* New tires, mounted and balanced all four

What might be causing this sound? I want to know what I should ask the shop to look at so I can target the exact issue sooner, especially since I already got all the wheel/steering/suspension maintenance done earlier this year. Should I ask for a quick visual inspection to check for anything obviously loose or worn? Any terms I should use to avoid unnecessary services?

I am driving to the beach tomorrow so if this not a critical issue but just a sound issue I’d rather have it fixed at a shop in the beach town.

 if you can bring it inside as you won't be using it absolutely.. 

  you can get a marine battery box from many parts stores that you have to verify it will fit.. you likely have a group 35 battery.. 

  this also gives you the ability to keep your battery from pets.. keeps any acid from leaking onto stuff.. i usually set the battery in the kitchen sink and wash the top.. sides and tilt it up slightly and wash the bottom , DO NOT TURN ON ITS SIDE.. 

 dry with paper towels..  now you can store it in the marine battery box..

 if you happen to have a black out.. if you have an jump start box that has a lead acid battery and an inverter.. NOT A COMPACT Jump start box. .  you can hook the jump start clamps to the battery and turn the switch on..   this should keep the jump start box powered for many hours allowing you to charge your phones or run a lamp.. 

 my state went into black out about 15 years ago.. i am during the blackout sitting in my apartment living room watching TV with the lamp on next to me.. my neighbors came knocking.. why do you have power.. i realized if i told them i have an inverter.. they will. bring extension cords and my little inverter won't handle that.. so i told them.. when the power bills come.. i pay them the first day. they have no reason to ever shut off my power.  they left very confused.. 

 i have a lead acid battery jump start box right beside me.. once every 2 weeks i plug it in and hook it to my external car battery and recharge it for a few hours. .

1n4f6lk,So... what's the real story about Motor Mounts?,"The engine in my Toyota Corolla is starting to lean now: the drivers side is lower, and I guess that explains why the steering wheel isn't at 12 o'clock while the car is going straight.

This car is $2500 Blue Book, assuming it was clean, and I've spent well above that in the past 2 months doing DIY work. Hell, I had a luxury car for 3 years and spent less than I did on this car.

The mechanic I trust tells me that I absolutely should go with OEM for motor mounts, but these mounts are $300 a piece from Toyota, and it's safe to assume I need all 4.

The prior owner claims he had these mounts replaced for $1000 at his mechanic, one year ago. I'm assuming they didn't buy OEM at that price.

I'm looking at Rock Auto and Wally World. RA has Anchor and WW has Beck Arnley. The Becks are more expensive, where a whole set would run me about $250.

I don't want to pay BMW prices to keep this jalopy moving, so what's my best play here? Any other brands I can use to keep the car moving?

Engine:          3.6 Pentastar V6 DOHC VVT

::BACKGROUND::

Our only family vehicle crapped the bed and now I’m pinned down to either borrowing rides or renting a car and neither are realistic options so I need some sober advice and hopefully dip into working on this. I’m not a novice but I don’t have a shop but I’ve not done this before so help out if you can. Please. 

Symptoms: The wife said the check engine light started flashing and the vehicle was shaking hard and she suspected it was a motor mount so told me about it and I began work on it as that was not unexpected at the mileage and age of the vehicle and the symptoms made sense.


Discovery: Obviously it wasn’t motor mounts. It was driving horribly, backfiring, no power. I checked the regulator suspects: plugs, coils, injectors, pump, filter, PCV, Oil sensors, down the line until I got to taking off the valve covers to check for mechanical damage or jumped time.

Findings: The cams are seemingly off parody and the bolt (pictured) came loose over time and worked its way into the cam sprocket and the sprocket cut a groove into the end of the bolt and I feel it jumped one tooth. However, I suck at cams and timing chains and all. 

Enquiry: So what I need to know from someone with experience with this vehicle or situation is this; I understand I need to have this done correctly and likely will need to replace components so this isn’t a “can I get away with it forever” type thing but what can I do other than loosen the tensioner on the chain and move the cam back to be parallel to the sister cam? No valves seem to be damaged at this time. But what it’s doing is firing on both strokes (which is exactly what it’s designed to do for emissions) but due to the timing being off (I suspect) it is double firing and that is what is causing the backfiring and sluggish performance. 

Thankfully it’s the 2,4,6 bank right up front but it is still going to be a PITA I have to deal with later.

Is there anything I can do to get it on the road until next weekend so I can order parts and get time off to handle this? I’m willing to accept jury rig and redneckified ideas within reason. Nothing dangerous or stupid.

1n42erj,Beware valve stem decay,"I just had a valve stem fail on my car. There was a split in the rubber that grew enough to reach the bore. I checked the others, one also had a large split that hadn't reached the bore yet. The other two had small splits.

This is similar to what you see on old tires, what people often call 'dry rot'. Rot isn't really the right word because it's different to the way biological matter rots. 

Rubber decays when exposed to UV radiation and ozone among other things. The bonds in the polymer chains are broken and eventually this causes large-scale failure. 

It's worth noting that the damage is all facing the axis of rotation. This tells me that the centrifugal force generated as the wheel rotates, bends the stem and helps create the cracks. I suspect using steel valve caps only exacerbates the issue, as a lighter, plastic cap would have less mass and bend the stem less. 

This is something I've never run into. These stems are six years old, and I've used stems for much longer than that in the past. I'm sure there are all sorts of factors involved that I'm not aware of, but it seems unusual to me. Maybe the rubber is cheaper these days.

Anyway, the point of this post is to make people aware. Have a look at your valve stems. Get a flashlight, bend them outward toward the edge of the rim, and see if there are any cracks near the base (assuming your rim exposes enough of it to see).

He has told me that i need to put more in as it’s a new engine so it will take a lot to fill but it was holding fine before hand and i had driven the car longer the day before.

I’m just so scared to drive it with my baby so I was wondering has anyone had a new engine fitted and needed to put a lot of coolant? Or is he just lying to me. The engine was fitted due to a head gasket issue so luckily if it’s anything like that it will be covered under warranty. did have a little bit of smoke yesterday when driving which is what made me check the coolant but not thick white smoke it was more like condensation kind of after idling at a round about and hard acceleration. I could only see it when infront of another car with lights on. I pulled over got out and it had stopped after about a minute if that. Oil is fine and not milky or chocolate milky it looks like good oil, had a head gasket issue before and it’s nothing like that. Smoke or oil can’t see a leak.

When I had my cambelt and waterpump done, I needed an additional 2l of coolant adding, as I had a really bad airlock.

This was at a main dealer as well, so they should have known better, but this is the same place that put a cracked, work-out serpentine belt back on, even when it was (a) obviously crap (b) due for replacement and (c) I'd told them explicitly that I wanted it replaced.

Places to watch out for coolant leaks on this car are the heater matrix - you'll possibly see the left hand of the car (looking at the front from outside) front floor carpets getting wet. The other one is there's (depending on the engine) a plastic housing (probably thermostat) which get brittle with age and start seeping (but if you've lost it all in that sort of distance, that's ""pouring"" not ""seeping"").

I'd be tempted to get some compatible coolant, fill the header tank on the left of the engine **when the engine is cold**. Fill it to the max line, then go for a drive with the heater on full, and let the engine come up to temperature. I think you've effectively bled it already, but this will just confirm it.

Then keep an eye on the level while you take it back to the mechanic to be checked.

Basically, just be upfront about the unappealing things so that it can weed out buyers who will give you a hard time.

Honestly, if you can even sell it, you won’t make much, but selling a junk car for cheaper is better than selling it for slightly more to a buyer who is going to reach out to you a month later trying to get their money back.

It’s a tough position, but you may need to look into public transportation or a moped for the time being. Selling this car isn’t going to get you enough to replace it with a working vehicle. Honestly, I’d just throw it up and say “Best offer. Open to trade for a moped”

Hopefully that is not the case, but usually if you are driving and the oil pressure light turns on, and the engine begins to knock, that is usually indicative of complete engine failure, due to sudden loss of oil pressure.

CuddleFishHero (Score: 3): Look under the car and see if there is oil everywhere, also pop the hood and check for the dipstick and fil port cap. Report back your findings. 

Gonna go off on a hunch and say you ran out of oil due to lack of it being added, improper filter installation, drain plug not being put back properly, or fill cap not being put back.

Also to note that if you don’t get regular oil changes and have a lot of crap built up in the engine something could have been knocked loose and blocked a galley or the oil pickup.  
Thats extremely rare though and usually happens when people add shit to the oil like marvels or sea foam.

Was very hands-off but could tell things were going wrong with the car, and once I got the ball rolling on learning and fixing things I was addicted. But for everything I fixed, something else would go wrong. Is this normal for someone learning auto mechanics or am I cursed with bad luck and should stop working on my own car?

Chain of events:

* AC was getting warmer, so paid for regas and it cooled again, but immediately the blower motor/fan started playing up and vibrating
* Replaced the blower motor and control module myself, cool air working again
* Feeling confident, did an oil and filter change, which was successful
* Left engine cover on bonnet and cracked windscreen
* Paid for windscreen replacement where a few things went wrong, but got it sorted
* Front brakes were due, so did both rotors and pads, and that seemed to be okay
* Heat starts to decline, and it’s the middle of winter
* Look inside coolant tank and find that silica bag that went with VAG’s G13 coolant. Try to remove it and I think I punctured it
* Flush out heater core and lots of silica crystals come out, heat improves but is intermittent
* Decide to do full coolant flush and replacement as preventative maintenance. Lots of brown and dirty coolant drains out, do x12 flushes, long day, but seems good
* Few days later while stopped at a drive through the coolant temp rises briefly, stupdily I park and remove the coolant tank cap and litres of coolant pours out. Manage to fill with bottled water and get home.
* From then on car starts overheating and I need to get towed off the highway
* Mechanic thinks it’s water pump. To save money and ’do it myself’ I decided to replace thermostat, water pump and timing belt, and also the heater core.
* Order wrong themostat but as it comes with housing I am able to replace the entire housing and thus ‘upgrade’ the thermostat to the plastic design. Feeling confident, I order the water pump and timing belt kit
* New heater core I was able to install  easily (I seem to be good at interiors); also did defroster flap / actuator around the same time
* While waiting for delivery, attempt to replace injector / valve cover seals because they are leaking oil. First I break the fuel return line connectors (very brittle), then I end up snapping a torque bolt in the head assembly. Feeling very shaken I did eventually remove the bolt using a transfer punch set and left handed drill bits
* But when I removed the valve cover to remove the broken bolt, I snapped the vacuum hose outlet and thus ruined the entire cover. Had to order a new one
* New one arrives (turns out I ordered the wrong version with miscalibrated PCV valve, but it did fit) and I manage to install it properly
* Have not been able to drive my car for a month at this point, so am desperate to get it working  again. Spend all day and into the night (I am working outside, no garage) changing the water pump (which had seized) and timing belt. Check alignment and all seems well, except I didn’t tighten the locating bolt in the timing peice, which I assume isn’t a big deal
* On the weekend, start the car, it won’t start, keep trying and it eventually starts but is idling rough. Time to take it to the mechanic. Get it towed, and he says the timing plate has cracked, ruining both the camshaft sprocket and the HPFP sprocket. Mechanic things valves are possibly bent
* $1300 AUD later it’s all fixed and working.
* I get the car back and it’s amazing to drive again EXCEPT the engine feels restricted like it’s not getting enough air, possibly because of the wrong valve cover/ integrated PCV
* Order the exact one from EKTA and think that at least I can replace the cover easily as I‘ve done it before and learned from my mistakes
* While removing the old cover — guess what — I break an injector! I pulled the injector from the top and the actuator connector bit (plastic) snapped off! Forgot to use a spanner and lift the injector from the metal shaft
* So now I need a new injector, and honestly I am too rattled to instal it myself, even though I think I know how to do it properly.

So what does all this mean?

Am I bad at this? Should I stop? Is it the car or me?

I would really value the persepctive of more experienced mechanics or DIYers around about now :)

Of those the one I find myself grabbing first is a brand called AstroAI that I bought on Amazon- I just checked and they are currently $27.    It is auto ranging and works just fine for everything I need to do in my job- primarily voltage, resistance and voltage drop measurements.       What I really like about it is the large display with backlighting, it also comes with a thermocouple allowing you to use it for temperature measurements if you do any HVAC work.

It does not come with a soft storage case for that price, if you want a case there are multiple ones on Amazon that it will fit in for about $10.

Personally, I would buy the cheap Astro one and give it a try- I think you will find it is surprisingly good quality for the cost.    If for some reason you find it does not do what you want it to do you have only spent $27, not multiple hundreds of dollars for a Fluke or Snap-on.

It is my first car which I bought for around £2k and has lasted me a good 5 years and 50k miles with (I’m ashamed to admit) zero maintenance. 

Now it has a very long list of fail items as attached…

The garage have quoted me £590-890 depending on the cause of the rear brake imbalance as they have said that could be something minor which would be a £60 job or a leaky cylinder which would be closer to £300. 

I have gone through quite a few phases with what to do:
- At first I considered just paying the money and getting it repaired as it would cost less than buying a new car. 
- I then figured, the car isn’t even worth the money I’d be putting in so would just scrap/sell as spares or repair for a couple hundred quid and just get a little upgrade. 
- Now, I have decided to try repair as much as I can myself and work towards an MOT pass. 

I’m quite handy in general but haven’t done any mechanical work. I’ve done a lot of research - read many forums and watched hours of YouTube videos and tutorials. I honestly feel pretty confident I can replace the front shock and coil, cv boots and ball joint. Obviously, these repairs will require work on both sides of the car but I will be working on the same areas anyways so doesn’t look to me like an extensive repair. 

I have today jacked up the car and had a look at the front nearside to scout out the job and check which tools I need.  I have some tools/sockets already and can borrow some more from mates (will need to buy the M14 spline though) - I’m not planning on using any impact tools as I’m trying to keep cost as low as possible. 

In keeping with the cost minimisation, I’ve actually seen on eBay I can get a front shock and spring for about £30 - it is used and from a VW dismantler with some good reviews. I am planning on getting the rest of the parts like the CV boots and ball joint from eurocarparts or gsf.

* Fog and front sidelights - could be a bulb, fuse etc
* Washer jets might need replacing
* Trackrod end easily swapped though these can be quite tight and need a blowtorch
* Balljoint easy too though with cars these age theres always a risk the balljoint will just spin and you'll need an impact and some pressure on the joint to get the nut off if it's not keyed on top to hold
* CV boots are easy enough but consider that you'll need to change the CV nut and this is also a high torque requirement to do up as well as undo and it's usuall a 30-something mm 12 point that needs to be thin enough to fit inside the hub. As for the actual boots, you may find buying whole shafts is cheaper and will have the proper genuine boot on. The inner bolts are theoretically also single use but have seen these reused before. It's also a horribly messy job and I hate CV grease so maybe bite the bullet and bring the parts to a mechanic to do for an hours labour or so.
* Replacing the whole strut assembly is smart but is such a pig on VAG cars with the need to split the hub, you'll either want a hub splitter VAG tool or i've seen allen keys or cold chisels used. Can take quite some coaxing to get the hub off the bottom of the strut without employing a lump hammer. The balljoint on the droplink can also spin like the others which might end up with needing a grinder if you're impatient and will need replacing. Top mount nuts can also break out and spin and you should in theory be using all new hardware for top mounts as well as the pinch bolt
* Rear brakes could be allsorts, possibly start with a bleed and new calipers, either way be prepared to open and correcly bleed the system

Honda sounds like less stress and potential cost with what you've said. Probably won't be a great track car though. FWD, not really designed for high performance, most are automatics etc.

A UKDM 180sx is the fastback with the pop-up lights and ussually has a premium to the price. Japanese S13 (180sx and 200sx) imports come with a range of engines and specs and different body shapes.
