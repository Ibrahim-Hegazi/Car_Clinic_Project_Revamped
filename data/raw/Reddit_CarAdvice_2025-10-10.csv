1o2kwks,"Mechanic still hasn’t fixed oil leak after $1,864 repair — keeps delaying (Hyundai Accent 2007)","Before you read further:

Yes I know it’s stupid and completely illogical.

Yes I know IM stupid.

Hey everyone,
I could really use some advice about a repair situation that’s gotten out of control.

Car: 2007 Hyundai Accent GS, ~150k miles

Invoice total: $1,864.74 (financed through EasyPay — high-interest loan, I haven’t started working yet and need the car for school)

⸻

A few weeks ago I noticed oil dripping near the front of the engine.
I told the shop I believed it was coming from the front crankshaft main seal — a previous mechanic and a friend both agreed that’s where it was leaking from.

The shop insisted it wasn’t the crank seal and said it was the valve cover gasket instead. They also said my radiator was cracked and needed replacement. I approved the repairs because I needed the car running, and they charged me around $1,800 total (radiator, valve cover, crank pulley, belts, fluids, etc.).

It’s now been over three weeks, and every time I call they tell me “it’ll be ready tomorrow.”
When I finally tried to pick it up, they said the leak is still there and they need to hold it even longer.

So basically, I’ve:
	•	Paid for parts and labor in full through EasyPay
	•	Waited 3+ weeks with no completed repair
	•	Still have a leaking engine
	•	Taken on high-interest financing because I urgently need this car for school

My questions:
	1.	How should I handle this with the shop?
	2.	Can they legally keep my car after I’ve paid?
	3.	What steps should I take with EasyPay (to dispute or pause the loan until the job is actually done)?
	4.	What’s the realistic fix for a front main seal leak on this car if that’s truly the issue?

Here’s what my invoice lists:
	•	$130 – Check for oil leaks (diagnostic)
	•	$195 – Radiator remove & replace
	•	$149.50 – Crankshaft pulley remove & replace
	•	$130 – Valve cover remove & replace
	•	$25 – Oil & filter service
	•	$79.22 – EPA/Hazmat/Waste fees
	•	Parts:
	•	Radiator (Automatic Trans) – $238
	•	Crankshaft pulley – $228
	•	Alternator drive belt – $44
	•	A/C compressor drive belt – $46
	•	Valve cover (not just the gasket) – $270
	•	Oil & filter – $29 total
	•	Coolant – $89.97 (3 gallons)
	•	Misc fluids & shop supplies – $105.50 total

Grand Total: $1,864.74
Paid via EasyPay Finance: $1,650 (the rest to be settled)

This is for a 2009 Toyota Camry. Mileage 112k.

\- $600 for the fifth one: Starting to get darker color old fluid should drain and fill \[trans fluid\]

\- $175 for the sixth: Due to age recommend changing fluid \[power steering fluid\]

\- $260 for the last one: Driver Belt showing age discoloration

We drive this car 2k-3k miles per year. Tires will also need to be replaced soon. Do you think these are -especially the first 4 pictures -struts- urgent?

Yes the boots on the struts are messed up but that is irrelevant unless there is an issue with the struts themselves. Ripped boots just mean that they will likely wear out faster, not that they are worn out. Generally they are getting a bit weak at like 100k miles but honestly they don't need done unless you are feeling an issue or they are leaking, which they don't appear to be.

Torn shock boots, oh well. The shocks may wear out a bit faster going forward but until they're an actual problem (failed or leaking) it doesn't matter.

Trans fluid is mileage-based, and $600 is exorbitant to do a fluid change. Color doesn't matter. The new fluid will look the same in a week.

Power steering fluid looks fine. Good color.

Control arm bushings look like... well, 100k mile bushings. As long as you aren't having any performance issues or suspension noise, you're fine.

I’m a disabled vet and as of new years 2025, my condition got significantly worse and I can no longer do most work on cars, so I have no choice but to bring it in. Last year I replaced the left UCA and Ball Joint, then had this shop do the alignment. 

The front left rubber (apparently tyre is a bad word on this sub) is cupping bad, and maybe 1x every other week there’s a clunk from somewhere in the front end while reversing into the road from the driveway. The clunk is new since the UCA/Ball Joint/alignment. All that happened because that front left tyre was cupping. They claimed to go through the front end before the alignment (they told me the UCA/ball joint were bad initially, I fixed it and brought it back) and they said all was good. 

I got the phone call today and they said nothing is wrong with the front end, everything is tight, tyre pressure was good, but say it’s the tyre, and they quoted me over $1,500 for new ones.

My partner took her car (Citroen C4 Cactus 2020) to have its yearly MOT and service done yesterday. Garage is reputable, it has done both my MOT and some of my friends before, never had an issue. Has very good reviews on Google. MOT passes, she goes to pick it up first thing this morning. When she starts the car the amber engine light comes up, so she goes back into the garage to query it. 

They deny all knowledge of any engine light and say the car was fine when they passed it the afternoon before. They say they’ll do emergency work on it to diagnose, and to come back later in the day. She spends all day trying to get in touch with them while she’s at work to get an update and they aren’t answering the phone. At 6pm, they finally return our calls and they say they are still working on it. At first they say that they thought it was something to do with the engine timing belt but that now the turbo is boiling hot and the car is very unsafe to drive. We’re perplexed, the car passed its MOT and was perfectly fine 12 hours before. They offer no other explanation and say she needs to leave it with them until (earliest) tomorrow evening.

This all seems very suspicious and dodgy to me. Does anyone know what this may have been caused by? 

To add context: they slightly overcharged her for the MOT and when she queried the price, they said it was because they had to go out and buy ‘specific’ oil for the car which was unusual. We were perplexed at this because we’ve refuelled the car before using Halfords car oil that was recommended by halfords for that make/ model and very easy to source. 

Could the issues I’ve described be from mis-oiling the car?

If the light is on, there's a code to be read, which should help them to diagnose it.

fyi, a red light means 'you have an issue, stop driving', if it was amber it would mean 'drive to a garage carefully'.

I agree the timing of this is highly suspicious, and that they may have damaged something during a service. You may need a different garage to diagnose and prove this.

I'm pretty sure it is a wet timing belt engine. A red light could be low oil pressure due to a clogged pickup. Which would be the code they scanned. And unfortunately for you could happen quite spontaneously, it could have been caused by incorrect oil at past changes but it wouldn't occur in a day from the wrong oil.

And the turbo should be pretty dang hot. This garage sound insane.

I am most of the way through doing a Timing Belt/Water Pump on my 2007 Mitsubishi Lancer (2.0L, 4G94 Engine, \~180,000 miles). 

The Harmonic Balancer was seized to the block, so I had to use a 3-jaw puller to get it off. There are no threaded holes on these, so I wasn't able to use a more purpose-specifc tool to get it off. 

When I went to thread the Crank Bolt back in to try and turn the sprocket a bit to line up the timing marks, I discovered that my Crank Bolt would not even start to thread. I believe that, even though I was sure the puller was not even touching the threads, it may have pressed in a slightly warped the first couple of threads. 

My question is, how do I go about trying to clean these threads up if the bolt won't even start to thread? Would a traditional tap+die kit do the trick, assuming I find the right size?

It only occurs for a second or two after doing either, but happens every single time. I looked at the rotor, and can see a distinct deep grove near the hub. What do you think is wrong?

1o2ejv6,07 Infiniti QX56 5.7l 4x4 - ABS engaging randomly,"Hi guys Hoping you can help me narrow down an issue that's making my Truck undrivable.

Symptom :  The brake pedal pulsates and the slip light on the dash flashes when I get up to 20-25mph. It stops and allows free movement for a while but will reengage the abs randomly.

The Speedometer works but the Tacometer isn't reading proper it just slightly bounces at initial engine load. 

Over the last year I have also seen the speedometer not work as well. I see the failed cluster is a common issue on this model QX56 but I figured it might help you pros diagnose but maybe it's unrelated. 

The vehicle has had a broken clockspring since I bought it years ago but I never replaced it because I don't need steering wheel buttons but I am aware of its functions as it relates to steering angle sensor. 

I had some steering rack bushings replaced a few months ago and I had some slip & traction control lights on but I was able to reset with the key pos 2 steering lock to steering lock reset trick as I don't have a scan tool to reset the steering angle values in the ECU. 

I just wanted to mention the steering angle stuff in case that played into the issue. 

I have no ABS lights on the dash and the slip light flashing is the only dash indicator when the fault is happening and the ABS is engaging. 

My initial thought was Wheel speed sensor but when I looked up the part I noticed engine speed sensors for input and output shaft as well. Then I thought of the no tach issue I noticed when road testing and thought that might be a related or indicative of one of those engine speed sensors as opposed to a wheel speed sensor on the hub

All I have is a cheap Bluetooth obdII scanner and torque lite on my phone so I can't see any wheel speed sensor or ABS module data. 

Can I rent a better scanner that will let me read fault codes stored in the ABS module? 

Thanks for any advice or help. I need to get this rig road worthy as soon as I can.

Rent your scan tool to get the codes and then you need to start verifying the wiring leading to and from the different sensors, WITH VOLTAGE DROP TESTS. There are so many issues with Acura and infinity where a little bit of resistance will kill a sensor circuit which will show off as a failed voltage drop test between the module and the sensor pigtail.

Of course do the quick ohms resistance tests on the given sensors to verify that the sensors are working but as I have found it's usually like a 50/50 ratio of the wiring being bad versus the sensor being bad

I'm in south Spain (Granada), just in case someone was wondering what sort of weather it's seen whilst parked.

  
The car was working perfectly when it was parked and I would like to give it a go and see if the engine will start, however I have been advised I could damage the engine if I simply just try to start it cold on the spot.

  
I've been advised to:

Clean the engine bay from leaves, dust, etc

Change diesel

New battery

Change oil

Change oil filter

Change coolant

  
I've also seen people easily remove the spark plugs and spray fogging oil under them to lubricate the cylinders, however I'm not sure if this is as easy with the glow plugs in my car.

  
Are there any other things someone could recommend? Or maybe tips or something to look into in case the engine doesn't start after trying the most basic stuff? Unfortunately I don't have any friends who are mechanics or that know a lot about cars.

  
I have also heard some people talk about the timing belt, to me it looks okay without any signs of breakage, but some people have suggested I should change it regardless before I try to start it. Should I change it just to simply try to start the engine?

Also I am not planning to drive the car until it passes the ITV which is the spanish equivalent of the english MOT (not sure if in other countries have similar tests)

Often the connectors are sealed from exterior moisture but not the interior of the antenna. The other thing to be careful of is make sure the seal is still present and you didn’t bend the roof panel. I see it very often because its very thin sheet metal there, an impact with enough force to break the antenna is enough to warp or bend the roof panel. The seal will not work properly against a warped panel and water will pour onto the top of your headliner. It’s an easy fix to straighten it but it does need to be done.

YT_Milo_Sidequests (Score: 13): Brake wear is dependent on driving style. Ask to see if they have measurements (they should) and if they have any photos (most dealerships will have that now also). Typically the front brakes wear down before the rear, but again depending on driving the style, the rears may also wear to a point where you would replace all 4 at once. The price is typical for dealerships for an all around brake job (pads + rotors), so they're pretty much in line with other dealerships on that. But again, I'd question the actual brake wear itself. Get measurements on both the inside and outside pads all around. If they insist on replacing rotors, ask to see if they measured the runout and thickness. If those are not out of spec, they can resurface your rotors."

Hi everyone,

I’ve got a 2018 Ford Escape 1.5 (U.S. version) that was imported to Europe, and I’m trying to diagnose a problem.

Misfire on cylinder #2

Swapped ignition coils between cylinders – the problem stays on cylinder 2

Oil on the spark plug and coil of cylinder 2

Replacing the spark plug didn’t help

White smoke coming from the exhaust

Coolant level isn’t dropping

Cabin heater works fine (both hot/cold)

Performed a CO₂ test – negative (no signs of coolant in combustion)

Used an endoscope camera – cylinder #2 shows visible oil


At this point, I’m suspecting valve seal leakage or stuck piston rings.
However, I’m also aware that this particular 1.5 EcoBoost engine is notorious for issues like dropped or cracked cylinder liners, so that’s in the back of my mind too.

Any thoughts on what I should check next or how to confirm if it’s a liner issue?

Thanks in advance for any input!

1o21rv0,Desperate need of advice! No boost at low rpms,"# Car: 2010 Audi A6 C6 2.0 TDI STOCK (CAHA, longitudinal)

# Reference vehicle: VW Passat 2.0 TDI (same engine family, transverse) – known to work properly

# Turbo: newly refurbished

I’ve been trying to sort out a **low-boost problem** on my Audi A6 for a few months now, and I’m hoping the experts here can help because I’m completely stuck.

**How it started**

I bought this **2010 Audi A6 C6 2.0 TDI (CAHA, longitudinal engine)** about four months ago.  
Right away I noticed the car felt weak.

I found a few **boost leaks** and thought that must be the problem.  
I fixed those, expecting the power to come back — but it didn’t.

Later I discovered the **turbo had excessive shaft play**, so I had it **professionally refurbished**.  
After fitting the refurbished turbo I expected the car to finally perform as normal, but the **low-boost problem remained**.

Since then I’ve been checking everything I can think of, but haven’t been able to solve it.

**Symptoms**

* Car is noticeably slow to build boost.
* In wide open throttle pull in 3rd gear (1500-3000rpm) logs:
   * Actuator position drops to about **0.7 V** as soon as I apply throttle and stays there until roughly **1800 rpm**,
   * then rises slowly and only reaches about **1.6–1.8 V by 3200 rpm**.
   * Actual boost never reaches specified boost, only comes close to it around 3000rpm
* No related fault codes stored.

**Checks already carried out**

* Vacuum supply good (always above 25 inHg, goes to 30+under high rpms)
* Compression test, all cylinders between 28-31
* Tested fuel injectors, they are well within tolerance.
* Actuator moves smoothly through full stroke in output test
* Turbo control selenoid has been changed to new Pierburg and nothing has changed
* Actuator position sensor 5 V reference, ground and signal wiring checked and good
* MAF, MAP and EGR tested good
* No boost or vacuum leaks found (smoke and pressure tested)
* Comparison with the good Passat:
   * Both ECUs command high duty (\~ 90 %) at low rpm
   * Passat’s actuator position rises quickly to ≈ 2 V by \~ 2000 rpm as boost builds
   * A6’s actuator stays near 0.7 V much longer and builds boost more slowly

**Logs**

Here are two third-gear WOT pulls (≈ 1 500 → 3 200 rpm):

MongooseWitty6310 (Score: 1): The low-boost issue is most likely the actuator response related, not fuel, compression, or vacuum.
ECU commands high duty, but actuator voltage rises slowly → suggests ECU adaptation, actuator mismatch, or wiring/solenoid issues. Comparison with Passat helps, but longitudinal A6 CAHA may have different actuator characteristics or ECU boost logic.
1. Verify actuator part number matches longitudinal A6 CAHA OEM.
2. Reset ECU adaptations for turbo/N75.
3. Log requested vs actual boost, actuator voltage, and duty cycle.
4. Check N75 solenoid and wiring for proper PWM under load.
5. If still slow, inspect refurbished turbo alignment or minor restrictions.
The most probable cause could be ECU/actuator mismatch or adaptation issue, not a mechanical or vacuum fault."

I suspect there may be a clog or faulty thermostat that occasionally completely stops the flow of coolant, leading to overheating and loss of coolant via boiling out of the cap's release valve. I'm looking for any opinions or suggestions, as there are several other odd symptoms i haven't mentioned, and I will list them all below. 

*  Car only overheats in idle or stopped, and it is very rapid, but doesn't always happen. 
* coolant only lost during overheating, no continuous leaks
* after overheating car will not turn back on for minutes, but will try to turnover
* after overheating car will quickly return to operational state if driven immediately
* The radiator fan runs even after the car is off. The fan will kick on for 10 seconds every minute or so, sounds like a jet engine. This lasts about 10 to 15 minutes after the car has been turned off. 
* hissing sound from under the left side of the dashboard, but no other symptoms make me think the heater core and hot air blows strongly.

it sounds like you have a coolant leak, if not in the heater core then probably close to it. How else would coolant smoke be entering the cabin vents? The rad cap is a long way from the cabin. From this leak you probably have air in the system, which leads to the rapid overheating.

I am a college student in Portland, Oregon but am originally from Massachusetts. I just bought a 2011 Honda Fit (like literally last night) from a used car dealership in Portland under my name. My mom wanted the car to be under our family insurance because it was cheaper to just be under an extension of her policy, which means the insurance (Amica, based in Massachusetts) views the car as under her name. I have not registered the car out in Oregon yet because the car would need to be registered in Massachusetts in order to qualify for the insurance.

I just have a lot of questions about that process. How do I ""gift"" the car to my mother so she can register it under her name? Can I even give it to her, if it is not registered under my name? Would we have to pay sales tax in Massachusetts when registering, even though there is no sales tax in Oregon? I just am so confused by the whole process and don't even know where to start. I know nothing about cars and bureaucracy so if anyone has any advice on how to proceed, it would be so so appreciated.

1o2dl5j,What to do about car door that won’t fully close?,"

‘12 Toyota Corolla LE 

I bought a used car a month ago. It’s in great condition aside from an issue with the passenger side doors. It looks like they opened the door really hard on a pole or something towards the middle where the doors meet & it slightly bent the rear door. This causes a clicking sound when opening because it’s catching on the front door. When I’m driving it sounds like the window is cracked open when it’s not. The door fully closes & latches but there’s a slight gap at the top. It wasn’t a deal breaker for me. It doesn’t look bad & the rest of the car was too good to pass up on. 

It rained the other night & I realized some rain gets in. Obviously I don’t want this. Is there anything I can do to get it fixed? In the mean time while I save up some money would it be a smart idea to buy some window visors? Instead of placing it on the window I could place it on the door above where the gap is. I just want to keep rain out of the car. The little air gap sound is annoying but I can live with it for a while as long as the car stays dry inside.

1o2d6ja,Why your car pulls to one side after a collision,"Seeing posts where someone's car was in an accident, got repaired, and now pulls to one side. Here's what's actually happening.

Most obvious cause is alignment being out of spec. Even minor collisions knock suspension components enough to throw off alignment angles. An alignment shop can measure and adjust these back to factory specs. This is the first thing to check and easiest fix. But sometimes alignment can't be corrected because something is bent. Control arms, tie rods, or subframe can be slightly bent from impact. The alignment machine shows angles are off but there's no adjustment that fixes it because parts are damaged. This means parts need replacing, not just adjusting.

Frame damage is worst case. If the frame or unibody is bent, no alignment adjustment will make it track straight. The whole car's geometry is off. This requires frame straightening with laser measuring. If the body shop didn't catch this, the car won't drive right.

Tire problems can cause pulling too. A bent wheel or tire with internal damage from impact makes the car pull. Swap front tires side to side as a quick test. If the pull switches directions, it's a tire or wheel issue not suspension.

Brake problems get overlooked after collisions. A damaged caliper or pinched brake line causes one side to drag slightly. Check if one wheel is hotter than others after driving. Hot wheel means that brake is dragging.

Check tire pressure first. If one front tire is lower than the other, the car pulls toward the low side. Takes two minutes with a tire gauge.

The diagnostic path should be: check tire pressure, get an alignment and see if it corrects to spec, if it can't be corrected ask why, check for bent parts, test after each fix. If nothing fixes it, frame damage is likely.

Don't ignore pulling after a collision. It means something is wrong. Wears tires fast and can be dangerous. Whatever caused it needs to be fixed. If the body shop didn't catch this, take it back and make them diagnose it.",2,1760033093.0,1,autorepair,1760124910,2025-10-09 18:04:53,2025-10-10 19:35:10,"cormack_gv (Score: 3): If it pulls after being repaired, it wasn't repaired properly."

Make sure to catch all the draining fluid in a large container and sit it aside. 

Then check both hose’s ends for damage. If good, reconnect the bottom one. Then fill with no more than the designated amount into the top hose and radiator. Squeeze the bottom hose every few seconds to “burp” trapped air out. When filling you’re really not going to get the full amount in, until the air is purged. That can be a pain in the ass. Once close, reconnect the top hose and start the engine.  Open the cap on the reservoir and as the engine comes up to temp you’ll need to add more fluid to the mid-point between hot and cold. Keep squeezing the bottom hose every few minutes. Then close the cap and let it come to full normal temp for five minutes or so. Check the reservoir mark. It should be close to “hot”. 

Me, I would just bite the bullet and take it to a shop who does this. They will make sure no air is trapped which can really mess up your engine. 

If you do this yourself, pour the used fluid into the empty jugs and take them someplace that will recycle them."

We all know the original legit LAUNCH Tablets with annual subscription. 

All of the internet including mhhauto, ebay and the various other carhacking related boards are full of colourful marketing pictures for things like:  
Diagzone - cloned launch   
X-diag - cloned launch   
Prodiag - cloned launch  
XPro5 - cloned launch

Are there more? All 4 of them have own ""shop"" or at least websites with manuals, apk download and serial number activations. As far as i know they use Thinkdiag2, Kingbolen Ediag, Dbscar5, Dbscar7, and other Interfaces which have to be modified in terms of firmware. 

Diagzone website lists older style interfaces with less speed or features.   
Prodiag and Xpro5 have kind of the same website look and feel. The appicon is the same but in different colour. Is it the clone of the clone?

As far as i found out there are only hacked launch softwares. Nothing from the other brands?

Launch - legit - brand behind former Easydiag, transitioned/renamed to x431  
Autel - legit   
Otofix - legit - subbrand of autel  
Topdon - legit  
Thinkcar - legit - brand behind thinkdiag and thinkdiag 2   
Mucar - legit - subrand of Thinkcar

Why do they create subbrands of their own product. Is it because of blue sells better than red, lol?  
Because of the focus on the american market maybe?

The difference between the various tools available comprises 1) how many such programs the tool has available and 2) how buggy the implementation is. For example, I have seen Youtube side-by-side videos for key programmers, one of which works and one of which fails, and the two tools have byte-reversed displays of what the key ID they're working with (i.e. one tool understands the endian-ness and the other tool screwed it up).

The other difference which is really just on the sliding scale with bugginess, is how much extra context a good quality tool gives you, which allows you to predict whether you're going to be successful or not (i.e. giving you the correctly distilled information so that you'll be able to accept or decline the job based on the year/model of the car)

The car is a Kia ‘24 ev6 GT-L AWD. He somehow hit or scraped the passenger side of his car against the divider at about 40mph.

From his description, most of the damage is cosmetic like scratched up side and rim, but the steering wheel is about 15 degrees off center. He doesn’t feel like the car is pulling as long as he compensates for the steering wheel being off center. 

Is it safe to drive the car with just compensating for the off center steering wheel until he gets a wheel alignment, or could there be something more dangerous wrong with the car and he shouldn’t drive it? 

And if the latter, are EV drive trains similar enough that we can go to a normal tire shop for diagnosis?

1o2f7hb,"Just Bought a 2012 Camry — Need Advice on EVAP Code, Steering, and Hill Rollback Issues","Hi everyone- I recently bought a used 2012 Toyota Camry (4-cylinder) a couple of weeks ago. During the pre-purchase inspection, a few codes showed up — I’ve attached the printout from that inspection. The main one was an EVAP code, and there was also a startup-related code. The mechanic mentioned the startup code might just be from dirty battery terminals or connections, since the car starts perfectly fine. Still, I’d like a second opinion on those codes and what the best next steps might be.
Two weeks in, I like how the car drives overall, but I’ve noticed a few issues and would appreciate some advice on what to prioritize.
1. EVAP Issue:When refueling, the gas pump shuts off every ~10 seconds. The shop smoke-tested the system and said the carbon canister needs replacing (quoted around $1,000, I’m in L.A.). Another mechanic told me that if the check engine light is off and it passed smog, I can leave it for now and just deal with slower fill-ups. Does that sound reasonable, or should I fix it sooner?
2. Rolling Back on Hills:When stopped on a steep hill in drive, the car rolls back more than expected after releasing the foot brake. The mechanic didn’t find any issues but suggested I could take it to a transmission specialist. After doing some research, I figured I should first have the transmission fluid checked, just to rule out old or burnt fluid before spending more time and money on it. Could that cause this, or is the rollback normal for this model without hill assist?
3. Steering:The steering wheel pulls slightly right and doesn’t return to center smoothly after turns. The mechanic didn’t see anything wrong, but I can definitely feel something’s a bit off while driving. From what I’ve read, a wheel alignment or lubricating/replacing certain joints might help. I’m just unsure if it’s worth the time and cost to pursue further, or if it’s safe to leave as-is for now.
I’m also having all the fluids (engine oil, brake, transmission) checked since I don’t have complete service records. My goal is to keep the car long-term without overspending upfront.
Given these issues and the inspection codes, what would you recommend addressing now versus waiting on? Any general maintenance tips for a used Camry at this stage would also be appreciated.
Thanks in advance for your help.

Filling the tank : I've had several cars that do this.  It's annoying, but sometimes you can work around it by filling it slower.  

Rolling back on hills - subjective.  How steep is steep?  It is normal for the car to roll backwards if the hill is steep enough.  You would really need someone who has experience driving the same car to tell you if this is normal or not.  As a former Toyota technician I can tell you the dealer techs would know what is ""normal"" just be feeling it drive, but Joey's wrench shop likely would not.  In my opinion, if there are no powertrain codes related to the transaxle I wouldn't spend any dough investigating this.  Check your transmission fluid yes.  Changing it is not likely to change how much it rolls back on steep hills.  
  
The steering seems to be the most important of everything you listed.  Pulling can be anything from tires to suspension to steering, but not returning to center smoothly could be something more serious, like the power steering rack beginning to fail.

The problem here is that EACH one of these issues will incur it's own diagnostic and repair fee.  I dunno who did your PPI, but it sounds like they may have overlooked some items.  I'm retired, but I do ""PPI style"" inspections for friends and family when they are car shopping.  Driving the car, checking for steering pull, vibrations, and general ride quality is about half of the process for me.  Check codes, check for leaks, age and condition of tires, brakes, suspension components (as much as you can do on the ground).  Your PPI sounds like they gave you a printout of the codes and kicked it in the butt out the door.

After having all the other work done, I am not going to be able to afford the timing belt change for at least 3-4 months. 

I know it's hard to say but what are the odds of the timing belt going? I don't hear any issues around the engine. But what else should I look out for?

I went back last week and they determined that one of the shocks was defective, so they went ahead and replaced the pair again.

So i’ll give some background about a year ago I hit a pothole on my way home from work (it was dark and i was tired) it also was more like a crater rather than a pothole. So it bent my front driver side rim, It was bent back to normal and i’ve had several tire rotations since then. But one noise that never goes away is this like rattling noise? It happens mostly when I brake or when I am coasting. I already had my wheel bearings replaced along with breaks and rotors. What is this noise? I plan to put it on the lift this weekend and take a peak but I’m not very car oriented so i would love some input.

Both engines are reliable. Both come with the same type of CVT transmission. CVT transmissions are sensitive to service, and need regular fluid change services to remain reliable. CVTs have a bad reputation because they're not fun to drive and some manufacturers have very unreliable units (or people treat their cars like shit and the CVT is the first thing to go), but Honda's CVTs are fine in general.

I would go for the 2.0 litre engine personally, it is from the very mature and reliable K-series and unlike the 1.5, it is not a turbo engine, so there is less stress on the engine, less complexity, less stuff that can break in expensive ways.

darklogic85 (Score: 2): They'll both be good cars. I'd go with the Touring, personally. The engine has more power, and the Touring being a higher trim level, comes with a number of options that the Sport may not have. Like larger touchscreen in the dash, better sound system, maybe wireless carplay/android auto(I'm not sure if the 2024 sport is wireless or requires a cable), rain sensing wipers, auto dimming mirror, wireless phone charger, parking sensors, leather and power seats, dual climate control and heated seats.

You'll want to double check the features I listed, but I'm pretty sure the Touring has them as standard, and the Sport may not include a lot of those features, unless they were included as separate addon options.

It's 1 year older, but half the miles and potentially a lot more features, so for only $200 more, I think it's worth it. Always get an inspection done and check the history on the vehicle before you buy anything, but based on what's shown in these screenshots, I'd be leaning toward the Touring."

But \*usually\* that kind of noise you describe is a light brake pad drag or surface rust getting scraped when you release the pedal. It’s pretty common, especially if the car sits overnight or in humid areas. Try doing a few gentle stops from around 30 mph to clean the rotors. If it keeps happening, have the shop check the brake hardware and caliper slides for sticking or lack of grease. Sometimes the factory pads glaze a bit and cause that sound too. I’ve seen this a lot at work (Zentner’s Auto out of Appleton!) 

If you want to check it yourself, pull the wheel and look for deep grooves or heavy rust on the rotors. Spin them by hand — they should move smoothly without scraping. Also check the pads for uneven wear or glazing. If everything looks fine but the noise stays, it’s time for that shop visit"

1o21svp,Desperate need of advice! No boost at low rpms,"# Car: 2010 Audi A6 C6 2.0 TDI STOCK (CAHA, longitudinal)

# Reference vehicle: VW Passat 2.0 TDI (same engine family, transverse) – known to work properly

# Turbo: newly refurbished

I’ve been trying to sort out a **low-boost problem** on my Audi A6 for a few months now, and I’m hoping the experts here can help because I’m completely stuck.

**How it started**

I bought this **2010 Audi A6 C6 2.0 TDI (CAHA, longitudinal engine)** about four months ago.  
Right away I noticed the car felt weak.

I found a few **boost leaks** and thought that must be the problem.  
I fixed those, expecting the power to come back — but it didn’t.

Later I discovered the **turbo had excessive shaft play**, so I had it **professionally refurbished**.  
After fitting the refurbished turbo I expected the car to finally perform as normal, but the **low-boost problem remained**.

Since then I’ve been checking everything I can think of, but haven’t been able to solve it.

**Symptoms**

* Car is noticeably slow to build boost.
* In wide open throttle pull in 3rd gear (1500-3000rpm) logs:
   * Actuator position drops to about **0.7 V** as soon as I apply throttle and stays there until roughly **1800 rpm**,
   * then rises slowly and only reaches about **1.6–1.8 V by 3200 rpm**.
   * Actual boost never reaches specified boost, only comes close to it around 3000rpm
* No related fault codes stored.

**Checks already carried out**

* Vacuum supply good (always above 25 inHg, goes to 30+under high rpms)
* Compression test, all cylinders between 28-31
* Tested fuel injectors, they are well within tolerance.
* Actuator moves smoothly through full stroke in output test
* Turbo control selenoid has been changed to new Pierburg and nothing has changed
* Actuator position sensor 5 V reference, ground and signal wiring checked and good
* MAF, MAP and EGR tested good
* No boost or vacuum leaks found (smoke and pressure tested)
* Comparison with the good Passat:
   * Both ECUs command high duty (\~ 90 %) at low rpm
   * Passat’s actuator position rises quickly to ≈ 2 V by \~ 2000 rpm as boost builds
   * A6’s actuator stays near 0.7 V much longer and builds boost more slowly

**Logs**

Here are two third-gear WOT pulls (≈ 1 500 → 3 200 rpm):

2 years ago, my original head gasket blew, and I had it replaced by my mechanic. FYI, the head was resurfaced and tested for compression.

My head gasket has blown again a month ago. I started the car, drove 10km, after I got off the freeway and refueled, the car showed symptoms of blown head gasket (white smoke, trouble starting, pressure in cooling system).

While I was driving on the freeway, my temperature suddenly rose to 105 degrees, and fell back down to 80 degrees after 30 seconds (did not reach the red line), and I drove for 4km after this and stopped at the gas station with no problem. It is only after refueling that problems were noticed.

In my last weeks of driving the car, I also noticed it car took longer to get to operating temperature / cool down.

My mechanic took the head off and is saying that the issue was probably just that the previous head gasket we installed was of bad quality.  
I have trouble believing this and given that the temperature indicator had been working a bit strangely lately, I feel like it was the thermostat or maybe the water pump  that failed (even though i had replaced the water pump with my last head gasket too).

Although, the mechanic said that when he last did my head gasket, he torqued the head bolts to spec, and somehow when he was disassembling my head this time, he said that the bolts came out very easily, suggesting that the whole problem might have  come from bad head bolts, which could've untorqued themselves over time with heat cycles.

About the alternator replacement, my sister-in-law's boyfriend did the replacement, because we don't have the money to go to a shop to get it done. He disconnected the intake (but didnt take out the curved tube out of the section) as well as the battery, then he got the air filter and the case holding it out and did what the video he had seen said. After opting to get the alternator out from behind the wheel rather than take the black section out from behind the engine, he swapped the alternators out. Once the newer alternator was in place he put everything back. He did mentioned something about the belt tension when he was putting the belt back on, I didn't catch it properly but it sounded like he wasn't sure if it was tight enough, but I don't know for sure.

That's all I really know, because I don't know much about cars, but I would like to know what can be done to fix it without having to go to a mechanic. It's not that I wouldn't if I could, it's just in basically living off of bread right now, so i would be grateful if someone could help me find the cause within a budget of zero dollars.

1o1sb2k,I am overwhelmed with evaluating the mechanical value of used cars.,"Hello, I am a prospective used car buyer who is completely overwhelmed with the pressure of figuring out what offers I should be throwing out to people on Facebook Marketplace. I want to state that I am not a flipper or a used car dealer. I don't care what a good deal is in the context of what the car's going rate in the market is. I care about what is a good deal in the context of what is a good mechanical machine to own to get me from Point A to Point B.

Essentially, I am trying to evaluate the mechanical value of the machine and find where the market is irrational. A rough formula for calculating this might be the purchase price of the car plus the cost of ownership (gas and repair cost) divided by how many years the car is going to last. The thing is that there are so many factors. The make of the car, the model, the miles, the year, how it looks in the picture, whether it looks like it's been cleaned, how many owners the car has, whether or not it has been in accidents, the amount of rust it has, and the service history. It is so overwhelming. There are so many factors, and I have no clue what factors are most important and how much each factor influences the price of the vehicle. I just feel so overwhelmed.

Is there any possible way you guys can walk me through what your thought process is when evaluating what a car's mechanical worth is in the units of dollars? I know that I should bring any car I am seriously considering buying for a PPI (Pre-Purchase Inspection). However, this does not help me when I am looking at Facebook Marketplace or Autotrader and am trying to feel out what cars are worth investigating and which ones are not.",1,1759970614.0,12,AskMechanics,1760124910,2025-10-09 00:43:34,2025-10-10 19:35:10,"cormack_gv (Score: 2): Only rational choice for a used car is an asian sedan/hatch about 10 years old for about $5k.

4. Determine the exact make and model of the car in your first position preference, then hit Reddit and brand enthusiast forums to determine the best model year, trim level, and engine selection. 

5. Look for available vehicles that meet your exact criteria. Entertain interest in no other vehicles.

6. Of the few vehicles that meet your criteria, remove from your consideration any vehicle that has been in an accident, has rust, or does not have a clean title.

8. Show up and meet the owner. Stereotype and discriminate with extreme prejudice. Trust your gut. Favor the immaculately tidy dentist over someone who might go by the name Methany, Kyle, or Karen.

9. Negotiate the price. Get it down to what you are willing to pay (not what it is worth). Send the vehicle that passes all the above assessments to a pre-purchase inspection. Reduce the above negotiated price by some portion of the repair costs to bring the vehicle back in line with mileage and age. Should you be entitled to brand new coolant and brakes in a used car? No. But, neither should you pay full market value for fully consumed parts. The real value is somewhere in between.

Edit to add: value is derived when a vehicle best fits your needs, not where the price paid is less than the objective measure of remaining mechanical life. Otherwise, the best value will be new cars (100% remaining mechanical life) that can be purchased at a discount because the car sucks. Like a Fiat 500 or something else similarly terrible."

1o2f4sa,Advice after a small bump,"My partner has supposedly had a small bump against someone’s tow bar in her works car park. The car bumped is larger, so did not have enough space to go forward out. My partner had to reverse our car to let the other driver out. While reversing, she did not get the bite, and has rolled slightly forward, supposedly hitting the other cars tow bar. This was not felt by my partner, and the other car has reversed out and then left the car park. This is all on dashcam.

Approximately a hour later, through a department email, they have requested the owner of our car to contact them, which is when they claim they were hit. Through email with my partner they have confirmed no damage, but want insurance details for IF anything relating near the tow bar becomes faulty in the next few weeks they can claim against us (rear camera, sensors etc).

The advice I’m after is, can they claim against us after leaving a car park, since no details were exchanged at the scene, and for something that may go faulty? It feels like we are some warranty in case anything happens to their car within the next few weeks. Apart from the dashcam footage, we don’t have any pictures of what the rear of their car looks like due to them driving away.

But, if it's long term parking (more than 2 weeks, especially in winter or during a period with a lot of rain), then handbrake off and in gear with chocks if needed.. It could rust up and end up seizing. If this happens, it's better for it to be seized off than on, because then you can at least drive it to a mechanic without having to have it towed or have a mechanic come out to sort it.

If you are, then you need to do your homework first. I recently exported a left hand drive Ford to Poland, that was on UK plates and as we are no longer in the EU it was a complete nightmare!

While I appreciate Italian laws may be very different, it's worth doing a quick Internet search on importing a car to Italy.

As it was a Non-EU car I had to notify the Polish authorities within 28 days and pay import taxes ( yes is was a second hand car!) Then purchase a temporary number plate and insurance while waiting to complete the process of getting a full Polish registration document and plates. You needed to show that the car had been legally exported (the part of the V5 you are referring to) and state when and where the car had entered the country. All of which had to be done within the 28 days, otherwise I could have been fined.

If your car is right hand drive, I'd seriously recommend selling it and using the money to buy a car in Italy. Toll booths, car park exits and drive thrus are no fun, when you have to clamber of the handbrake. 

But whatever you decide to do, I wish you all the best as a fellow Ex-pat and I really hope the move works out.

Arrivederci!

EDIT: I just re-read your post and you are planning on a permanent export. So please do your homework on Italian laws for importing a vehicle. I have a Polish partner and Polish friends who helped me, if you don't have local contacts and really want to take your car, I know there are companies and agents that specialise in this type of thing.

	•	NSF and OSF brake reaction bushes split and require replacing 
	•	OSR shock absorber leaking and requires replacing
	•	Tie rod issues
	•	Oil leak either from the engine or the gearbox

I’ve been advised that the shock absorber issue would fail an MOT and looks like it has been leaking for a while (before I bought the car). 

I’m confused because these parts were fine at the most recent MOT—or at least not flagged. How likely is it that all of these issues developed in just over a month, versus them being pre-existing and somehow not detected during the MOT? 

I’m aware these issues are mostly wear-and-tear components and things do deteriorate I just feel it doesn’t seem likely for all of this to develop in just over a month.

Just to note as well, the MOT the car had in September 2024 had an advisory that there was a light misting of oil on the OSR shock absorber which is the one that is now leaking.

I have a Volvo XC40 with a petrol T3 engine, mileage around 130,000 km. The car is used but has been completely trouble-free until now.

While returning from a holiday trip of about 3,000 km, something strange happened shortly after refueling.

We were already running on reserve, with the range showing around 40 km. We stopped at the nearest gas station, I filled up with petrol and went inside to pay. When I got back into the car and tried to start it, the engine fired up normally — the revs went high for a second, then dropped down and the engine stalled.

I tried again, but the same thing happened — the engine started, ran briefly, and died. On the third attempt, I tried giving it a bit of throttle and to drive off, but the car wouldn’t move because the parking brake was still on. After waiting a bit and trying once more, the engine finally caught and ran normally.

Since then, the car drove without any issues. We got home, and the next day it started and ran perfectly fine. But today, after about an 80 km drive and two hours parked, the exact same thing happened again.

1o282tk,How much info would you expect from a dealership when they have your car for a month?,"Question as per the title really. The dealership we bought our ""used approved"" car from just over a year ago have had our car with them for the best part of a month. They charged us a fortune for 2 separate diagnostics sessions (a week apart...) and then for 2x injectors to be replaced (a week later), luckily mostly covered under our extended warranty up to £1000. Now they're quoting another £1000 for the remaining injectors that need changing + a software update from the main dealer (for ""relearning the injectors""? Not really sure what that means)

I'm at my wit's end with them because I keep trying to ask around for more info from specialists (online / locally) and they all ask me for details of what's been checked, ruled out, specific error codes that have been seen before/after each part has been changed, **specifically how they've determined that the injectors are at fault** (was it a spray test? electrical test? leak test?), etc -- but all I'm getting back, even when involving the service manager is vague high level emails written in stream of consciousness like ""Checked X which was deemed not at fault then we checked Y which was fine, determined injectors 2 and 4 needed replacing then saw continued misfire upon road test so determined remaining injectors also need replacing."" I'm flummoxed by the complete and utter lack of details considering the costs involved and the amount they're trying to charge me outside of the warranty. Also pretty pissed off tbh about the fact it's been out of action for a month at this point all whilte they're charging us daily for the courtesy car insurance.

The whole process has been incredibly frustrating as it seems that every time they book it in, they book a tiny slot, run out of time and then tell us they've had to book us in in another week's time when they have the next free slot. I'm not sure why they don't just book it in and continue working on it til it's fixed? Every time they run out of time we have to go back at the end of the queue!

Back to the point / tl;dr:

* Am I right to be frustrated/concerned by the lack of detailed notes from the workshop?
* Is 1 month a reasonable amount of time to wait for them to diagnose and repair 2 out of 4 faulty injectors (with the other 2 still to do!!)
* Is it normal/reasonable to ask/expect the full technical notes of what's been tested (and how) and ruled out so far? P-codes of any faults seen?

Spray some soapy water all over it and look for bubbles. You may well see it's the bead between the wheel and tyre that's leaking. If so, you may find getting a garage to reseat the tyre will fix it.

The Cooper S is likely the most sensible, at least financially wise. A lot cheaper to buy and insure. Probably most ""fun"" too. 5 doors would be preferable though and these look hideous with 5 door to me.

this posting isnt an attempt to find a buyer.  It'll be months away.   

As a 27 year old (28 at point of sale) car in surprisingly good condition I'm unsure whether to try specialist sales sites or the usual FB / AT options?  During the 7 years I've been running this car its gone from being a weird older car that I get pitying looks for turning up in, to something people stop me and ask about.  

I've noticed that the average price of currently marketed cars seems to have approximately tripled since i bought it, but I presume thats down to the general uplift of value for used cars.  

Things I can see as a difficulty as well as an opportunity are as follows.   

Being the incredibly rare 150bhp 2.3i non-turbo,its far simpler mechanically and not reliant on a Saab-only ignition module to run (has a regular coil and distributor) - most cars on sale are turbos. Maybe I can market this as an upside  

But unlike the Turbo models it isnt ULEZ compliant. And theres no way of spinning that into a benefit   

And also unlike them, it can't be tuned. Although I suspect more thna 150bhp in that chassis wouldnt make it any safer...

1o20ejn,Keyless entry relay attack help,"Hi all me and my adhd like to find info and help, while I was looking at relay theft attacks I can across this info, hopefully it can help someone save their precious car, might not work on all cars but it’s worth a try see below 

Steps to Disable Keyless Entry on Hyundai Kona
1.  Turn Off Keyless Entry via Infotainment System (If Available):
	•  Where: In the vehicle’s infotainment menu.
	•  How:
		•  Go to Settings > Vehicle > Door Settings (or similar, depending on model year).
		•  Look for Smart Key, Keyless Entry, or Remote Lock/Unlock.
		•  Toggle the option to disable keyless entry (this may vary by model; some Konas only allow partial disable, like handle sensors).
		•  Confirm and test by trying to unlock with the fob or handle—it should now require the fob’s buttons or mechanical key.
	•  Note: Not all Konas have this option in the menu (e.g., base trims or older models like 2018–2020).
2.  Use the Mechanical Key to Lock/Unlock:
	•  Why: Bypasses the keyless system entirely.
	•  How:
		•  Extract the hidden mechanical key from the fob (press release button on fob’s back, pull key out).
		•  Use it in the driver’s door key cylinder to lock/unlock manually.
		•  This doesn’t disable the system but avoids using the keyless feature.
3.  Disable Fob Signal Temporarily:
	•  Why: Prevents the fob from communicating, effectively disabling keyless entry.
	•  How:
		•  Store the fob in an RFID-blocking pouch or metal container (e.g., a Faraday bag or even a tin box) when not in use to block the 433 MHz signal.
		•  Alternatively, remove the fob’s CR2032 battery (pry open fob, pop out battery) when parked for long periods—reinsert to use.
		•  Pro Tip: This is a common anti-theft trick to prevent relay attacks.
4.  Dealer or Custom Disabling:
	•  Why: Some Konas require a dealer to reprogram the smart key system to disable keyless entry permanently (not always an option).
	•  How:
		•  Contact a Hyundai dealer or service center. Explain you want keyless entry disabled for security (e.g., to prevent signal amplification theft).
		•  They may update the car’s software or adjust settings (free under warranty; ~$100–200 otherwise, per forum estimates).
		•  Rarely, a mechanic can disconnect the keyless antenna, but this voids warranty and isn’t recommended.
5.  Toggle Keyless Mode (Temporary Workaround):
	•  How: In some Konas, you can toggle keyless entry off by pressing lock then unlock on the fob for 4–5 seconds (listen for chimes). Repeat to re-enable. Check your manual (page ~4-10) for exact steps.
	•  Note: This works inconsistently across model years.

Can anyone recommend car dealers around London, pref West London up to Reading as well as similar distance NW and SW? I’m not too keen on East London area as in my limited experience and my brothers’ extensive experience, there are a lot more dodgy dealers around there. Plus it can take around one and half hours each way whereas most places around west London can be reached in 30-45 minutes. 

I’ve been to see a few cars that look great on paper only to learn all were involved in minor accidents, repair job good to the uninitiated but my brother (a seasoned mechanic) spotted the repair jobs straight away. 

What’s more worrying is they’ve all had issues and all of them use the line “don’t worry about that, if there are problems the warranty will sort it”. 

It seems these dealers I’ve visited are knowingly selling shoddy cars then expecting buyers to get it sorted under the warranty. 

I can’t always take my brother with me so knowing of any dealers that peeps have had good experiences with would be a good place to start. 

I did try looking for private sellers but most are selling their cars at dealer prices so I’m guessing they are dealers or at least someone selling cars on the side. 

So if you’ve purchased a car recently or know of good dealers in the W/SW/NW London + outer counties area please share the details. 

Thanks in advance.

However, I apparently cannot appeal the engineer's write off decision.

So here's where it gets weird. They are offering to give me the value of the car (about £5.1k) less a buy back back fee which would give me about £3.5k cash in hand. I can then get the repairs down and even reinsure it with them and carry on driving as usual. 

For me, the math is not mathing. Why would they pay out/incur costs of ~£5k and not £1k for a simple repair?

Graz279 (Score: 5): On a manual always the handbrake, the first 2 options should not exist.

Since having first learnt to drive, over 35 years ago, I'd always do handbrake + 1st gear.  Belt and braces approach., and why not for the few seconds it takes if it will stop your car rolling away in the event of a handbrake failure.

1o1s9cj,Changing wheels,"I'm possibly buying wheels for my car on Friday, they're the same size as my current (15 inches), am I able to take the new wheels to a tyre shop and ask them to change over the tyres on my car to the new wheels and put then back on my car? 

As far as I know, it should be simple to fit them on, 4 lug nuts and 15 inches, and I'm not sure if I need to worry about anything else.

The wheels I'm possibly buying are originally from Peugeot 208, i drive a Peugeot 207. Many thanks!

I haven’t had to have a puncture done for years (touch wood) but I’m guessing £15/20 per corner these days.

Chaosvex (Score: 2): You can ask. Worst that'll happen is that they might say no but you'll find somebody happy to do it.

PositiveMeat7863 (Score: 2): They will be able to swap the rubber over to new rims as long as your car can fit the new rubber. The only thing you need to think about is if you're swapping rims. Rims have different measurements that you need to make sure fit your car.

  
If you are only swapping rubber, you need to make sure that the rubber isn't too wide/tall for your car.

  
If all the measurements are the exact same, a tyre shop and or any garage should be able to just swap it for you no problem."
1o1rh54,Saw one of these while driving home tonight.,"Fiat Dino coupe. I think it was an F reg like this, so 1968. It was late at night but, from what I could see, it was in a darker shade of blue than this.

If you're not familiar, the Dino coupe and Spider from the late 60s used Ferrari's masterpiece of a V6 engine and were proper performance cars, to rival the likes of the Porsche 911. This will be the 160 bhp 2.0-litre, before they went to the more powerful 2.4 (as also used in the Ferrari Dino 246 and the Lancia Stratos). The Dino coupe also had a star turn as the Mafia's choice of car in The Italian Job.

Absolutely stunning car - one for the dream garage, for sure. Beautiful understated Italian style, and the most accessible, usable way into one of those amazing engines.",80,1759968249.0,1,CartalkUK,1760124910,2025-10-09 00:04:09,2025-10-10 19:35:10,usermono (Score: 7): Beautiful
