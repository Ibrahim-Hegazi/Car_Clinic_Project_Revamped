If you don't get it fixed soon, it will leak and destroy itself, but it should be perfectly workable unless the axle ate into the housing, which i don't know if that happens before it stops shifting or not. To me, this looks like it is indeed the bushing, which is just [this](https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-x0abscdu02/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/26633/15993/144064T__69417.1672408975.JPG?c=1). I don't know these transmissions, but it might be advisable to have the differential's bearing on that side checked in case it saw some wear from the axle flopping about, but those bearings can take a lot of abuse so hopefully an axle bushing and seal will be all that's needed.

1myg2ad,Using n EVAP smoke machine to detect car ac leak?,"I was looking to source whatever is needed to use nitrogen to find what seems to be a large leak in my ac system after being advised against using shop air, which is in my case an 8 gallon aluminum air compressor. I was doing some research and googleing and found that quite a few experience people have successfully done this. I just read a reply on another one of my posts suggesting against it because the oil will destroy the system but I also just watched a video of another guy replacing the EVAP machine oil with I think PAG oil. He was able to get see the smoke coming from the ac compressor.

So, has any ever had any success with this approach? I see some cheap smoke machines on Amazon and am thinking of trying it out but wanted to see what kind of mixed answers I get on Reddit first. I've already asked about shop air vs nitrogen and the answers were mixed, but this approach seems easiest. Well shop air actually, since I already have an air compressor but the talks of extreme moisture.

Note: I was planning on replacing the compressor, condenser, and expansion valve, if that's relevant. The condenser looks horrible, dirty, and is bent out of shape, along with the radiator, which I will replace too. Radiator has a leak I repaired but it still leaks. Extremely slow to were the reservoir needs to be filled ony afer months. New leak detected yesterday so I have no choice now. The condenser, radiator and expansion valve are fairly cheap so why not on a car almost 20 years at over 172k miles right? It's a 2007 Saturn Ion-2 2.2, by the way. I think guy may have killed the compressor adding refrigerant and over filling the system. Made a loud pop\metal clank sound. So that's why I'm replacing that. Basically because everything is stock. Just hope it's not the EVAP core


Thoughts?

Nitrogen is for finding pinhole leaks on a customer car in the same visit. it gets through quickly bc molecules are smaller. Don‚Äôt have to recharge system with dye and tell customer to come back later.


If you‚Äôre replacing everything the leak test is a moot point.  The leaks are going to be at the Orings that attach those parts to the lines (orings are replaced at the same time) or the components themselves.  Condensers are most common bc they‚Äôre in the nose of the car.   If you‚Äôre doing a compressor, condenser and TXV, that‚Äôs all the orings.  Service valves can do it too.

It‚Äôs a Saturn,  they don‚Äôt even make cars anymore.  Don‚Äôt get too technical.  Don‚Äôt worry about it, it doesn‚Äôt matter.   Shoot the shop air into it and spray dish soap water on everything if you want to verify the leaks.    Any moisture from the shop air will vaporize and be removed when system is put under vacuum after parts are replaced.  The purpose of the vacuum is removing moisture bc a vacuum makes water boil.


There‚Äôs no easy way to evaluate the evaporator while the system is inop unless dye has been injected before.  Borescope will get involved, bc only way is to look at it.  Sometimes can remove the blower and shove a camera in the case.  Some cars, can pop off the panel covering the defroster vents if it‚Äôs a separate piece from the dash as a whole and put borescope through that.  When it‚Äôs running use a Freon sniffer in the vent.   The drain tube is another access point if it‚Äôs bigger than the borescope.  If it‚Äôs got dye can look for dye residues in the drain tube.


Plain blue dawn dish soap makes the best leak tracing soap.  Tires, air suspension, even AC.  The bubbles stick around a long time and build piles even on pinhole leaks.

First would be to check your insurance policy.  Some policies cover the replacement of a FOB.  They may cover the entire cost, or some part of the cost, which can get up to 4- 5 600 dollars or more.  

Some cars, notably Mercedes Benz make replacing FOBS a virtual life in hell.  BMW is also somewhat difficult, particularly if it‚Äôs a newer vehicle.  Older vehicles in some cases, allow for reprogramming a FOB as DIY, but you‚Äôd almost always need to have at least one FOB handy for programming.

IF you cannot find the matching FOB, you‚Äôd likely have to go to the dealer, or possibly, an Automotive KeySmith.  LockSmith that is.  Some of these mobile services can reprogram a FOB, but you‚Äôd have to enquire to see.  Maybe someone here who is an expert will chime in on  some other solutions?

1myg1hc,2016 Hyundai Elantra Sport - Braking Issues,"Hello everyone

A friend of mine is having issues with her braking system on her Elantra. For context, she told me she got her pads changed and calipers resurfaced and rebuilt roughly a month or two ago (and she believes they flushed and changed her fluid as well). She has had no issues until yesterday.

**The issue is the emergency brake indicator on the cluster is stuck on, and her brake pedal is usually too soft and not engaging her brakes (can press halfway before firming up), and at times perfectly firm. Very occasionally when testing her brakes, her RPM runs away.**

Given that her brake pedal is erratic and not consistently soft, I am assuming her fluid, lines, and cylinders are fine and she has no leaks. Her acceleration running away in addition to the brakes leads me to believe it is a vacuum leak in her brake booster. Can anyone weigh in and help me out?

I have not had time to see the car in person and investigate yet, this is all based on her describing the issue to me. Was hoping to get some opinions before I head over there later to hopefully have a head start. Are there any potential faulty brake sensors or anything like that which could have similar symptoms?

A core deposit is for rebuilt/remanufactured units, because you need another core coming back to rebuild and replace the inventory of the one you sold. New olds stock is manufacturer overruns, and there is no core going back to the manufacturer to get rebuilt. I would assume that this is not a new Motorcraft unit, but a new aftermarket unit, especially because it's the cheapest option. But, there still shouldn't be any core deposit for the new unit, at least to the retailer/distributor, because a new manufacturer isn't rebuilding OE units.

In theory, the difference between a rebuilt and remanufactured unit is: rebuilding means taking it apart and fixing what is wrong, remanufacturing is replacing all of the wearable components. But, the reality is somewhere in between, and that comes down to the company that builds the units...

Parts stores don't build units. so it's entirely possible Carquest and Autozone are buying the same units, from the same builder... Which, nobody working the counter in the stores is going to know, and neither company is going to release to the public... If it is the same units, coming from the same builder - Outside of price, which is the same - Which company provides you with better service?

JustBlarg (Score: 1): It depends where the tick is coming from.  With the light dragging sound, it may be the pads sticking and releasing due to the rotor being slightly out of parallel.  The pads drag a little, then release when the thinner part of the rotor passes between them.   This causes a clicking sound as the pads shift in the caliper bracket.   If you are also noticing a vibration when braking at higher speeds, I would suggest looking into getting the rotor(s) machined or replaced.   

I would also recommend checking the caliper, bracket, and pads.  

If the caliper piston is sticking, it could be constantly holding the pads against the rotor, causing premature wear, and possibly excessive heat that leads to the rotor warping.   

If the bracket was ""cleaned"" too aggressively at the last pad service, they may have ground away a bit too much material, and now there is excessive free space for the pads to shift up and sound, contributing to that clicking noise.   

Check that the end tabs on the pads themselves weren't ground down to ""make them fit better.""  I've worked with numerous mechanics over my career that think, ""If the pads don't slide into the bracket, grind the tabs a bit til they do.""  In my experience, the majority of the times pads haven't slipped into the bracket easily, it was due to build-up in the bracket that didn't get cleaned out.   Grind down the tabs too much, and again, it creates too much free space, and the pads can shift around."

1mydln3,Looking for Advice: 2006 Tacoma - Code P2759 (Torque Converter Solenoid Electrical Circuit),"My 2006 tacoma with a five speed AT recently threw up a code P2759 (Torque Converter Culth Pressure Control Solenoid Electrical Circuit). The truck was shifting perfectly fine before and since the code. I cleared the code and it comes back after a couples miles. 

  
I took it to a reputable local transmission shop and they said resistance on the transmission wire harness was technically out of spec, but did not think it would be causing this code (6.1 vs 5.0-5.6 in the FSM). They suggested changing the TCC solenoid, but noted that this might not solve the issue (if there's a broader/mechanical issue in the transmission). I'm supposed to drive from the east coast out west for an elk hunt in less than two weeks, so i just had to have them try the solenoid replacment, and they'll likely complete that early this week. I have two main questions:

1. If replacing the solenoid does not keep the code from popping up, can you help me understand how this might be related to anything other than an connection issue between the ECM and solenoid (since that's what the code indicates)? Could it be a case where there could be a mechanical issue with the torque converter thats causing the solenoid to short (trying to lock up the TC, but it won't so solenoid eventually shorts?)? Maybe I'm just having trouble coming to terms with a possible rebuild needed, but there were legitimately no driveability issues so I'm just having trouble following how there wouldn't be other symptoms.

2. If replacing the solenoid does not work, how bad is it to continue driving the vehicle without TC lockup? I understand that RPMs will be higher at highway speeds, impacting gas mileage etc, and likely more heat produced without going into lockup, but i do have a separate tranmission cooler and as i noted there haven't been any other symptoms. Would it be idiotic to try and drive it across country with that issue (really need an offroad capable vehicle for the hunt so really don't want to rent a car, and this is my only vehicle)? I don't care if i get 10mpg highway for this trip, largely just wondering if i'm likely cause any other significant damage before the end of a 5,000 roadtriop by driving without lockup?

But this also means that it‚Äôs fully electronically controlled. So if you take it out and mess with it without the proper understanding and failsafes it will develop issues communicating with the ECU(especially if you moved the flap which I‚Äôm sure you ended up doing when you cleaned it). Ford also coats their throttle body‚Äôs in a coating to prevent carbon buildup. Depending on the cleaner you used you could have stripped this coating off resulting in there being a mm bigger gap between the plate itself and the throttle body.

1my8pf2,Could two bottles of Chevron Techron cause this?,"Have a 2013 Chevy Impala LT. Has about 80,000 miles on it. After having the dashboard warning for like a year I finally asked my mechanic to fix a fuel system issue. He replaced a fuel pump or something. Also had the oil filter/oil changed. After that was done I put in a 12oz bottle of Chevron Techron. Full tank of gas. When it was almost empty I filled the tank again and put a second bottle of Chevron Techron in, this time 20oz. According to the Chevron Techron specs PDF, they recommend only two bottles of the stuff between oil changes. So that's all I did.

Soon after that, not sure how long exactly, maybe a week or two some new issues started. It started flashing Stabilitrak and Reduced Engine Power warnings. It was struggling to accelerate and almost stalled a couple times when stopped at intersections. 

At the same time some new weird noise started. The noise sounds like some kind of vibration type noise. It's only really noticeable when I'm accelerating down the road, the more I accelerate the louder it gets. I think the noise is coming from the rear of the vehicle, possibly the muffler area. But it's hard to tell when I'm sitting in the driver's seat so I'm not sure. If I put the car in neutral and rev the engine the noise is much fainter. Much harder to hear. I told my mechanic about this noise and asked if they noticed it when driving it but they didn't. 

So my mechanic had it for a week and changed the Fuel Pressure Sensor. Gave it back to me and I drove it home. It seemed okay when I drove it home 4 miles (except for the weird noise). It sat for a couple days over the weekend and then I tried to drive it out to do some errands and it started stalling/reduced engine power/stabilitrak warnings all over again. So I took it back to my mechanic. 

He had it for another week. They couldn't figure out what was causing the issues. Eventually he changed the battery (a 4yr old cheap battery that I had recharged twice with a Hulkman recharger) and the stalling/reduced engine power/dashboard warnings stopped. The car is actually driving now. However, the weird noise is still there and still loud when accelerating down the road. I don't understand how my mechanic and his guys haven't noticed the noise because it's fairly loud and distinct. 

I am wondering if the Chevron Techron I put in the gas tank somehow messed something up like one of the mufflers or catalytic converters? I'm in western PA. 

This car has been very problematic for me since I got it used in 2021. I've had to put a lot of money into it for repairs and I don't even drive it a lot. I drive like 4-6 miles to work and back 5 days a week normally and that's it. Although the roads around here are really bad. A lot of potholes and bad paving and steep hills.

Edit: I tried to record the noise when driving but it's hard to. If you listen closely you can hear the low hum/vibration type noise I'm talking about when accelerating. Also recorded the engine in another video.

1my6pnt,Th350 transmission leaking from this hole,"Hey all, thanks for any information you may be able to help with. I was driving my C10 one day and a few miles from home it seemed like the transmission was having a real hard time shifting into 2nd gear, but working fine otherwise so I drove it right home and parked it. After some time, I got around to attempting to address the problem. 

I started it, let it get to operating temp and checked the transmission fluid level to find nothing on the stick. Adding, running through the gears and re checking it repeatedly until I looked under the truck to find a puddle of fluid. It looked to me like the drivers side of the transmission pan popped a leak.

I shut it down and popped the pan loose, drained the fluid and let it sit with a bucket beneath it. A couple days later the bucket had another 4 or 5 quarts of oil in it which I assume drained out of the torque converter/ rest of the transmission over time. Overall, about 2.5 gallons came out in total.

I ordered a new pan, pan gasket and filter, some RTV and grabbed a couple gallons of fluid. Cleaned everything up and put it back together. When I was adding my 5th quart I heard it leaking into a catch pan below and upon investigation thought it was leaking from the linkage above the pan, but on second look I realized it‚Äôs actually leaking from the hole 8-12‚Äù above that linkage. 

What is this hole and why is it there? Should something be connected to it or should it be plugged? I tried researching about it but the only thing I could find stated it was part of the casting process and was plugged from the factory. It‚Äôs definitely not plugged anymore.

It uses a very simple beam suspension, where adjustment is made by installing specifically shaped shims between the wheel hubs and the suspension beam.

Your rear is BARELY out of spec on one wheel, so the effort and cost just doesn't make sense.

The Total Toe value of the rear as a whole is good, which means that it won't cause excessive wear.

Technically speaking, the rear is steering 0.14¬∞ to one side, but that's not even close to being noticeable.

Edit: explanation of what a beam suspension is

TLDR: It's pretty much a swinging door, with wheels bolted to the top and bottom of the swinging end, laid flat under the car.

Grab an I beam as long as the car is wide. Screw wheel hubs (with bearings) to the ends of the I beam. Put wheels on them.

Grab a tube. Put a hinge on one side. Weld the other side to the I beam, close to one wheel.

Repeat, and put it close to the other wheel. You should now have a wide U with hinges on the tops of the U and wheels on the corners of the U.

Put this wide U under the car.

Bolt hinges to the underside of the car. Put springs and dampers between I beam and car body.

Congratulations, you have made a beam suspension.

1my4d4b,1998 Ford Ranger Won't Start & Acts Like New Fuel Pump Is Bad,"I really need some help. I have a 1998 Ford Ranger 4.0 that I use regularly for my mowing job. First of all, several weeks ago, it started acting weird. When I would start it up, the RPMs would go up, drop significantly (sometimes to the point of even shutting the engine off) and then climb back up. Then often times, it wouldn't even start on the first time of turning the ignition, but then it would on the second.  
Then two weeks ago I replaced the fuel pump and fuel filter, figuring that that was the problem (I could also hear the pump giving a soft winning when the truck was on). I was hoping that if I just replaced the pump, all would be well. Shortly after driving it again though, the same problems started coming back. A couple days ago, it would turn but not start. When I checked the fuel pressure valve, it would just drip out gas. I disconnected the relay, and put it back in an hour later, and then it started, but was running pretty rough. The RPMs would jump and then drop over and over again while it was just sitting there.  
I decided to replace the fuel pump again two days ago, hoping that I just bought a bad pump, but after replacing it, I'm still having the same issues.  
Two more notes:   
1. I've also had the check engine light come on. I tested the code and it gave me: ""System Too Lean: Bank 1""  
2. When I turn the key to the on position, I can hear the pump priming itself.

This morning, it won't start again, and I'm really stressed because I need it for work. Does anyone have any advice or insight they could share to help me figure this out? Any of it would be much appreciated. Thanks!

1myg48o,Using n EVAP smoke machine to detect car ac leak?,"I was looking to source whatever is needed to use nitrogen to find what seems to be a large leak in my ac system after being advised against using shop air, which is in my case an 8 gallon aluminum air compressor. I was doing some research and googleing and found that quite a few experience people have successfully done this. I just read a reply on another one of my posts suggesting against it because the oil will destroy the system but I also just watched a video of another guy replacing the EVAP machine oil with I think PAG oil. He was able to get see the smoke coming from the ac compressor.

So, has any ever had any success with this approach? I see some cheap smoke machines on Amazon and am thinking of trying it out but wanted to see what kind of mixed answers I get on Reddit first. I've already asked about shop air vs nitrogen and the answers were mixed, but this approach seems easiest. Well shop air actually, since I already have an air compressor but the talks of extreme moisture.

Note: I was planning on replacing the compressor, condenser, and expansion valve, if that's relevant. The condenser looks horrible, dirty, and is bent out of shape, along with the radiator, which I will replace too. Radiator has a leak I repaired but it still leaks. Extremely slow to were the reservoir needs to be filled ony afer months. New leak detected yesterday so I have no choice now. The condenser, radiator and expansion valve are fairly cheap so why not on a car almost 20 years at over 172k miles right? It's a 2007 Saturn Ion-2 2.2, by the way. I think guy may have killed the compressor adding refrigerant and over filling the system. Made a loud pop\metal clank sound. So that's why I'm replacing that. Basically because everything is stock. Just hope it's not the EVAP core


Thoughts?

Put the air to it and pull a deep vacuum to boil the moisture. If it is empty and the compressor grenaded it will be full of moisture anyway. It must pass a vacuum hold test before you fill it anyway.

Smoke machine is a waste of money and a dumb idea. You will only have a visual and can barely add any pressure. It will not even push past blockages or oil in the system.

Nitrogen or air will at least get you over static pressure if it fails the test and a spray bottle with soap and water will find a leak before you even plug that machine in.

I am assuming you have a vacuum pump and recovery equipment so you are not venting gas to the atmosphere if there is gas in the system.

If not you can pay someone to recover the gas. Change all the components yourself, and have them properly vacuum and charge it.

Edit: many tire shops and dealers have nitrogen tanks for tire filling now. You could make an adapter if you want to.

Coolant will eventually after years and years become slightly less effective at cooling, but most engines dont require 100% full cooling capability to run at their normal operating temp.

I just believe in if it ain't broke, dont fix it. I mean, sure, over time, the Coolant might end up looking a little gunky, but at that point if it starts overheating youre going to do a full flush anyway which would clear out any gunk like that so, imo, just fuckin drive it."

1myg5kn,Using n EVAP smoke machine to detect car ac leak?,"I was looking to source whatever is needed to use nitrogen to find what seems to be a large leak in my ac system after being advised against using shop air, which is in my case an 8 gallon aluminum air compressor. I was doing some research and googleing and found that quite a few experience people have successfully done this. I just read a reply on another one of my posts suggesting against it because the oil will destroy the system but I also just watched a video of another guy replacing the EVAP machine oil with I think PAG oil. He was able to get see the smoke coming from the ac compressor.

So, has any ever had any success with this approach? I see some cheap smoke machines on Amazon and am thinking of trying it out but wanted to see what kind of mixed answers I get on Reddit first. I've already asked about shop air vs nitrogen and the answers were mixed, but this approach seems easiest. Well shop air actually, since I already have an air compressor but the talks of extreme moisture.

Note: I was planning on replacing the compressor, condenser, and expansion valve, if that's relevant. The condenser looks horrible, dirty, and is bent out of shape, along with the radiator, which I will replace too. Radiator has a leak I repaired but it still leaks. Extremely slow to were the reservoir needs to be filled ony afer months. New leak detected yesterday so I have no choice now. The condenser, radiator and expansion valve are fairly cheap so why not on a car almost 20 years at over 172k miles right? It's a 2007 Saturn Ion-2 2.2, by the way. I think guy may have killed the compressor adding refrigerant and over filling the system. Made a loud pop\metal clank sound. So that's why I'm replacing that. Basically because everything is stock. Just hope it's not the EVAP core


Thoughts?

1myg1yc,Using n EVAP smoke machine to detect car ac leak?,"I was looking to source whatever is needed to use nitrogen to find what seems to be a large leak in my ac system after being advised against using shop air, which is in my case an 8 gallon aluminum air compressor. I was doing some research and googleing and found that quite a few experience people have successfully done this. I just read a reply on another one of my posts suggesting against it because the oil will destroy the system but I also just watched a video of another guy replacing the EVAP machine oil with I think PAG oil. He was able to get see the smoke coming from the ac compressor.

So, has any ever had any success with this approach? I see some cheap smoke machines on Amazon and am thinking of trying it out but wanted to see what kind of mixed answers I get on Reddit first. I've already asked about shop air vs nitrogen and the answers were mixed, but this approach seems easiest. Well shop air actually, since I already have an air compressor but the talks of extreme moisture.

Note: I was planning on replacing the compressor, condenser, and expansion valve, if that's relevant. The condenser looks horrible, dirty, and is bent out of shape, along with the radiator, which I will replace too. Radiator has a leak I repaired but it still leaks. Extremely slow to were the reservoir needs to be filled ony afer months. New leak detected yesterday so I have no choice now. The condenser, radiator and expansion valve are fairly cheap so why not on a car almost 20 years at over 172k miles right? It's a 2007 Saturn Ion-2 2.2, by the way. I think guy may have killed the compressor adding refrigerant and over filling the system. Made a loud pop\metal clank sound. So that's why I'm replacing that. Basically because everything is stock. Just hope it's not the EVAP core


Thoughts?

1my6lyx,Cold air from one side only: RX8,"So I think of myself as a rather decent home mechanic, but this one has me stumped. So I recently got my AC repaired at a shop, the compressor had seized up and I didn't want to go through the guess work of if metal shavings got into the lines or not. And for the first month or so it was great.

 Then it started to have issues where it wouldn't cool when at a stop, I figured maybe my fans were going out, but I wasn't having overheating issues with the car, so ruled that out. Then thought maybe the condenser fins were bent, took a look, and they're all good. Come to find out that the fans aren't on at stops at all times, so guessed maybe they were just cycling and that would cause it, made a plan to hook up a relay to keep them on at a stop if the AC was on. 

And now comes last week, when suddenly it's blowing a little cold (not amazing, but something) at a stop.... from the passenger vents. Driver side is hot, at all times, moving or not. It's still blowing air just as hard as the passenger side, but it's all hot air. The passenger side is at least cooler than nothing at a stop, and pretty cold when moving. I don't have dual climate control, so it's making no sense to me why there's such a drastic difference.

I've got a theory that it might be overcharged/undercharged for the extreme levels of heat that AZ deals with, and that it's cooling the passenger side moderately, but by the time the refrigerant gets to the driver side of the evaporator, it's already hot enough to not do anything. Haven't gone to hook up gauges to see yet, it being summer and humid has been a hell of a deterrent from working on it at all. 

Figured I'd get some second opinions to see if that's the good next step, or if I should just take myself right back to the repair shop and blaming them for something. Don't wanna do that unless it's actually their problem, everything they did is lifetime warranty though, so I will if it is.

All going well until a few months back when I could hear louder than normal road noise which got worse under braking. A mechanic said it was the front tyres as they were low on tread. I swapped them and tears for good measure for brand new continentals. Honestly, it just made it worse. The noise was awful, above 20mph just a constant drone and being able to hear all kinds of resonating from the tyres. However, on fresh tarmac, the noise went away‚Ä¶

So, had a mechanic check again and he said all the suspension looks ok but try changing the tyres. I don‚Äôt know how well he inspected the suspension, not a great deal I don‚Äôt think. So I eventually bought new Good Year tyres on just the front and it immediately made it 10 times BETTER! I was amazed. 

However, the noise hasn‚Äôt completely gone away. Whilst a lot better there is still something there that is causing louder than normal road noise on almost all road surfaces. 

What could it be? What should I look for? I‚Äôve ruled out the wheel bearings. It‚Äôs definitely something on the front axle.

1mxxdou,Is my MAF sensor faulty ?,"2013 Peugeot Partner 1.6 HDI

When the engine is cold, sometimes the car does not start first time and the engine management light comes on. If I wait 20 seconds then it starts. I also get a loss of power when driving sometimes.

The scanner has detected several codes including P0100 so I suspect a faulty MAF sensor but I want to be sure before buying a replacement.

This is the live data for a short RPM vs MAF test. Does that line for the MAF indicate a faulty sensor ?

At idle it‚Äôs around 5‚Äì6 g/s which is about right for a 1.6 diesel, and when you rev it up the reading climbs smoothly into the mid-teens. The line follows RPM without flat spots or crazy values, so the sensor itself is responding like it should.

The P0100 code doesn‚Äôt always mean the MAF is dead ‚Äì the ECU can set it if the signal drops out intermittently, if there‚Äôs a wiring/connector issue, or if the airflow reading doesn‚Äôt match what it expects compared to boost and EGR. On these engines it‚Äôs also common for EGR problems or boost leaks to trigger MAF codes.

Before you throw money at a new MAF, check the plug and wiring carefully, give the sensor a clean with proper MAF cleaner, and make sure the EGR isn‚Äôt stuck open. If you want to be sure, log it on a full-load pull in 3rd gear ‚Äì you should see the MAF rise way above 50 g/s. If it does, the sensor is fine and you‚Äôre chasing wiring, EGR, or a boost leak instead."

Those ais are kinda very good at reading fault codes and giving possible issues.

""The P0170 fault code stands for Fuel Trim Malfunction (Bank 1). This is a generic diagnostic trouble code (DTC) that indicates the powertrain control module (PCM) is detecting that the air-fuel mixture in the engine is either too lean or too rich.
‚ÄãThe PCM constantly monitors the air-fuel ratio and makes adjustments, known as fuel trims, to maintain the optimal mixture for efficient combustion. When these adjustments fall outside of the manufacturer's specified range, the P0170 code is triggered.
‚ÄãSymptoms
‚ÄãCommon symptoms of a P0170 code may include:
‚ÄãIlluminated Check Engine Light: This is the most common and often the only symptom.
‚ÄãPoor fuel economy: An incorrect air-fuel mixture can lead to wasted fuel.
‚ÄãLoss of power or hesitation: The engine may stumble or feel sluggish, especially during acceleration.
‚ÄãRough idling or stalling: An imbalanced mixture can cause the engine to run unevenly.
‚ÄãStrong fuel smell: A rich condition (too much fuel) can cause unburned fuel to exit through the exhaust.
‚ÄãCommon Causes
‚ÄãThe P0170 code is often a symptom of another problem, and a proper diagnosis is necessary. The underlying cause can be something that makes the engine run either too lean or too rich.
‚ÄãPossible causes include:
‚ÄãFaulty Oxygen (O2) sensor: The O2 sensor provides crucial data to the PCM for fuel trim adjustments. A bad sensor can give inaccurate readings.
‚ÄãMass Air Flow (MAF) sensor issues: The MAF sensor measures the amount of air entering the engine. A faulty or dirty MAF sensor can send incorrect data, leading to an improper air-fuel mixture.
‚ÄãVacuum leaks: A leak in a vacuum hose or intake manifold gasket can allow unmetered air into the engine, causing a lean condition.
‚ÄãFuel system problems: This could include a faulty fuel pump, a clogged fuel filter, a bad fuel pressure regulator, or clogged fuel injectors.
‚ÄãExhaust leaks: An exhaust leak before the O2 sensor can allow outside air to enter, causing the sensor to incorrectly read a lean condition.
‚ÄãThis video from YouTube provides a detailed explanation of the P0170 code, its causes, and how to go about diagnosing and fixing it.

Also checked its fuses. Fuses are not blown. Took to a local mechanic who also checked fuses and told me to take the dealership which diagnosed and found out the cars computer/board had a burnt section and told the computer board and one other part needs to get replaced.

The dealership quoted me $2600 for replacing the board and reprogramming. I went to few other local shops and they won't touch the car because its electricals and again told me to go to the dealership.

I cannot afford to spend $2600 to fix low beam for a car that I bought for $6000. But I cannot drive without low beams, driving with high beams is irresponsible , dangerous and asshole behavior which I do not want to do.

So now my question is, can i use the DRL to turn on the low beam by switching the plugs so that when I turn on the DRL low beam will light up.   
  
 I compared the fuse amperage low beam (10 A) and DRL (40 A) which confused me. You can see in the photos. The fuse 21 seem to control DRL, low beams and high beams. But low beam and high also have separate fuses.

1myg3kx,Using n EVAP smoke machine to detect car ac leak?,"I was looking to source whatever is needed to use nitrogen to find what seems to be a large leak in my ac system after being advised against using shop air, which is in my case an 8 gallon aluminum air compressor. I was doing some research and googleing and found that quite a few experience people have successfully done this. I just read a reply on another one of my posts suggesting against it because the oil will destroy the system but I also just watched a video of another guy replacing the EVAP machine oil with I think PAG oil. He was able to get see the smoke coming from the ac compressor.

So, has any ever had any success with this approach? I see some cheap smoke machines on Amazon and am thinking of trying it out but wanted to see what kind of mixed answers I get on Reddit first. I've already asked about shop air vs nitrogen and the answers were mixed, but this approach seems easiest. Well shop air actually, since I already have an air compressor but the talks of extreme moisture.

Note: I was planning on replacing the compressor, condenser, and expansion valve, if that's relevant. The condenser looks horrible, dirty, and is bent out of shape, along with the radiator, which I will replace too. Radiator has a leak I repaired but it still leaks. Extremely slow to were the reservoir needs to be filled ony afer months. New leak detected yesterday so I have no choice now. The condenser, radiator and expansion valve are fairly cheap so why not on a car almost 20 years at over 172k miles right? It's a 2007 Saturn Ion-2 2.2, by the way. I think guy may have killed the compressor adding refrigerant and over filling the system. Made a loud pop\metal clank sound. So that's why I'm replacing that. Basically because everything is stock. Just hope it's not the EVAP core

1mycn9m,CA Auto Finance,"Has anyone dealt with these before? Been trying to buy a car the last few weeks. The car in question is ¬£50000. I earn a good wage and have a good credit rating. Took a lot of hoops just to get finance approved, they wanted me to do open banking (I refused) so eventually they settled on bank statements and my P60.
Then I was due to collect the car today (Saturday), but the dealer phoned me late Friday afternoon saying that CA want to see proof that the car is insured. I informed them that I'll change my insurance over on the day of collection after making sure everything is ok with the vehicle. They said that CA will not pay the money to the dealer unless they see insurance. 
I agreed to change the insurance from the vehicle that we would be part exchanging to the new one and send them the documents. The insurance is in my partner's name as she is the main driver of the car, and I'm a named driver. CA wouldn't accept this and said the insurance has to be in my name as the main driver! 
So I got an insurance policy set up with direct line on the basis that I've got 14 days to cancel after collection of the car (as we already have perfectly good insurance in my partner's name which is cheaper). 
This new insurance has been declined by CA as it is a direct line 'essentials' policy as they claim it isn't fully comprehensive. This is obviously untrue as it's a fully comp policy just without any 'bells and whistles'. 
All this faff has resulted in me not being able to collect the car today and doubts whether I'll be able to collect the car at all.

1my6pbk,Short-term rejection of Approved Used Mercedes delivered yesterday ‚Äî independent report found serious faults. Next steps?,"Location: London, England (purchase from Mercedes-Benz of Warrington, Group 1)

TL;DR: Approved Used car delivered 22 Aug 2025. Independent inspection on 23 Aug found serious issues (possible coolant‚Äìoil contamination, low coolant, excessive steering noise, rear bumper misaligned). I‚Äôve formally exercised short-term right to reject under the CRA 2015, asked for full refund and collection at their cost. Looking for advice on next steps and what to expect.

‚∏ª

Timeline
	‚Ä¢	22 Aug 2025: Vehicle delivered (Mercedes-Benz E-Class 2.0 diesel)
	‚Ä¢	23 Aug 2025: Independent inspection (ClickMechanic) raised multiple red flags.
	‚Ä¢	23 Aug 2025: I emailed the retailer (sales + business manager) to reject the vehicle under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (short-term right to reject, within 30 days).
	‚Ä¢	23 Aug 2025: Also raised a formal complaint with Mercedes-Benz Customer Services. Car is insured, parked, and I‚Äôm not driving it due to safety concerns.

Key findings from the inspection
	‚Ä¢	Evidence of coolant‚Äìoil contamination (‚Äúcreamy residue‚Äù under oil cap) with photos.
	‚Ä¢	Coolant below minimum at time of inspection.
	‚Ä¢	Excessive steering noise when stationary (possible steering rack issue).
	‚Ä¢	Rear bumper misalignment (passenger side), not to ‚ÄúApproved Used‚Äù standard.

What I‚Äôve asked for
	‚Ä¢	Full refund of all sums paid (including any fees/deposit).
	‚Ä¢	Collection from my address at their cost.
	‚Ä¢	Confirmation of timelines for collection and refund in writing.

What I want to know from you
	1.	Under the short-term right to reject (within 30 days), do I have to accept a repair first, or is rejection/refund the correct route given these faults?
	2.	Is there anything specific I should/shouldn‚Äôt agree to on the phone? (I‚Äôm keeping everything in writing.)
	3.	Reasonable deadline: is 24‚Äì48 hours to confirm collection/refund steps fair, and what‚Äôs a reasonable timeframe for the refund to hit my account once accepted?
	4.	If part of the payment was by credit card (>¬£100), is it wise to start a Section 75 conversation in parallel, or wait for the dealer‚Äôs response?
	5.	Anything else I should document right now (e.g., dated photos/video, mileage, fluids) to protect my position?
	6.	If they push back or stall, is the next step a Letter Before Action and then small claims/MCOL? Any wording tips for that stage?

Notes
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm happy to let them inspect/collect the car, but I won‚Äôt be driving it.
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôve asked that all confirmations are provided in writing.
	‚Ä¢	I can share redacted pages of the inspection if useful (no personal info).

No. The hybrid system will not give you trouble.

If you keep it in to OLD age, at some point after 10-15 years you will need a hybrid battery refurbishment/replacement. Budget ¬£1k. OTOH you'll never need a clutch and never have any gearbox trouble so it's a small price to pay..

The 2.0 engine is not as quite reliable as the 1.8, especially in the earlier years (the E210 Corolla started in 2018, yours is a 2020). It's not a \*bad\* engine - although you can find some exaggerated harsh words on the owners club forum - but it took time to work the bugs out.

Keep servicing it at the main stealer to get 10 years of warranty.

1my0gj4,"Just passed my Driving test, Which car should I go for?","As the title says, I'm 30M and finally passed my driving test here in the UK after living here for about five years since moving from India. It feels great to have finally crossed the finish line, but now I'm facing the next set of challenges, and I'd love some advice from the community.

I've got a couple of things on my mind:

**1. Which first car should I buy?**

I'm looking for a reasonably priced hatchback, preferably a **Ford Fiesta** or a **Volkswagen Polo**, with a budget of up to ¬£6,000, though I can be flexible. My main priority is a reliable engine and a decent interior with some modern tech and economy. I'm aware that Toyotas are a great choice for reliability, but I'm not a fan of the interior of models like the Aygo, or even like a Honda Jazz, which feel a bit dated and ""plasticky.""

I'll be commuting to work a couple of times a week, a short 30-minute round trip, but I also want to use the car for longer road trips to explore the UK. I'm not too concerned about power; a 1.0L engine would be perfect.

**2. What is with these insane insurance prices?**

Seriously, what is going on? I was completely shocked to see prices like ¬£2,000 for a 2010 Fiesta. That's if I pay upfront! I'm considering using a 0% credit card, but these prices are so discouraging that it makes me want to stick to rentals. However, I've learned that most rental companies won't even give you a car unless you've had your license for a year.

I'm not sure how much the premium will drop over the next year or two, but is it worth having a black box? I consider myself a responsible driver‚ÄîI don't speed and I practice safe driving habits. Beyond increasing my excess and getting a black box, what else can I do to bring these costs down? Am I missing something here?

**3. What's the deal with my new license?**

I'm a little frustrated with the DVLA process. After passing my test, my instructor told me to go to the Post Office to apply for my full license with my new address. I submitted my pass certificate, provisional license, and a D1 form, but it's been two weeks, and the online status still says, ""you have an unclaimed test."" Any idea when I can expect my license to arrive?

Any advice you can offer on these points would be hugely appreciated!

The M3 is also fitted with summer tyres and I don't fancy swapping them out for winter tyres for a few reasons.

  
My dog is 15 and probably only has a few months left with us at which point I can start flying again and just leave the M3 in London and make do without a car in Aberdeen. I've tried the train but he's so old and is unable to last the long journey without wetting himself and soiling his nappy.

I'm wondering whether to SORN the M3 over winter and buy something like an Octavia or Passat to handle motorway mileage and winter driving for the next 6 months and then use the M3 as my daily again for Spring 2026 when unfortunately my dog probably won't be with us anymore.

1mxwy2p,BMW G20 330i Premature Spark Plug Failure,"Hi,
I have had ongoing issues with my BMW (330i G20 2019, 58k miles). To summarise:
- August 2024 was when the car was bought
- October 2024 was when I had a drivetrain issue. BMW roadside assistance replaced spark plugs, and the car was fine after that.
- August 2025 - another drivetrain issue. BMW service centre is saying bad spark plugs, and that they look very rusty and one looks dropped and refitted (attached).


I‚Äôve been back and forth with the service centre and BMW directly and can‚Äôt seem to get anywhere.

The roadside technician I spoke to a few days ago said spark plugs shouldn‚Äôt need replacing every 9 months or so and that it‚Äôs not normal, especially given I‚Äôve only been driving 5,000 miles since replacing.

I asked that the service centre check for any underlying issues, and they confirmed that they couldn‚Äôt find anything that would cause the problem.

Also, a few months after I got the spark plugs fitted in October, I had an oil leak due to the oil cap falling off. I believe it wasn‚Äôt tightened properly when the roadside technician initially came and checked, as I haven‚Äôt changed anything within the engine except washer fluid.

The service centre is charging me almost ¬£500 for spark plug replacements and the diagnostics/labour.

This doesn‚Äôt seem like a normal issue, and I can‚Äôt find others with similar issues. I‚Äôm skeptical whether there‚Äôs an underlying issue or the roadside technician just didn‚Äôt fit the spark plugs properly.

I also had an MOT done at a different BMW service centre a few weeks ago, with nothing raised (apart from a tyre advisory issue), but I‚Äôm not sure spark plugs would be checked during an MOT. I‚Äôm up to date with services too.

Any thoughts? Are these just coincidences or could there be an underlying issue with the car that would cause premature spark plug failure?

I can‚Äôt seem to get anywhere with customer service. Is there anyone I can contact to escalate?

Insurance is probably not a huge problem, they are well into the realms of classics now and typically owned by drivers who want to protect a possession with emotional value, this helps drive down the risk factors that insurers use to decide on insurance costs. 

I‚Äôm not sure how familiar you are with these cars, the way they were designed has a habit of trapping water in odd places, with the amount of salt used on the roads in this country this causes this era of Benz to rust from the inside out. Even with pristine front wings (the other weak spot for rust), it‚Äôs no guarantee of the more critical structures being free from rust. Furthermore you may wish to avoid driving these in winter as a lot of the places that gather water can‚Äôt be reached easily by rust protection methods. 

Mechanically, the 4GTronic gearbox is almost indestructible (just don‚Äôt mess with the shift timings like I did). The SOHC petrol engines are will withstand a huge amount of neglect and abuse, but just be aware of perishing rubber components, and that they use a coil and distributor setup for ignition which needs to be kept in good condition, but actually very cheap to fix. The SOHC engines can also run hot in traffic, the viscous fan setup isn‚Äôt great. The NA diesels are slow as muck but pretty solid, and will run off vegetable oil if you wish, turbodiesels have mostly died due to the head gasket not being strong enough. 

Overall the early cars are very simple cars with carryover engines from the W123, if you are mechanically inclined a lot of maintenance and repair is DIY. Otherwise it can get expensive with labour putting things to rights. 

Also if you want to narrow your searches down the following categories will help. The W124 designates the saloon but also the overall generation. 

S124 - estate. Watch out for hydraulic issues with SLS
C124 - pillarless coupe. Watch out for seatbelt handover issues
A124 - convertible. Same as coupe but also watch out for hydraulic issues with the roof. Weak spot is the hydraulics at the roof latches that will spray you with hydraulic oil. But lower spec cars had manual roofs. 
V124 - LWB (limo and ambulance). Honestly no experience with these.
