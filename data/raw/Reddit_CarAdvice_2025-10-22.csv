From what I‚Äôve read, it might be related to the transmission relearning process after the battery/ECU reset. But since this is a DCT, I want to make sure I‚Äôm not ignoring an early warning sign of something worse.

Why? 

Modern vehicles need battery registration because of how their electrical and charging systems have evolved. In older cars, replacing a battery was simple ‚Äî you just swapped it out. But in newer cars (especially post-2010), the battery, alternator, and engine control module (ECM or ECU) work together in a very controlled way.

Many cars now have an Intelligent Battery Sensor (IBS) or Battery Management System (BMS) attached to the negative terminal.

It constantly monitors:
State of charge (SoC)
State of health (SoH)
Current draw and temperature

If you don‚Äôt ‚Äúregister‚Äù the new battery, these readings remain inaccurate, and the system might think your brand-new battery is still weak ‚Äî causing problems like:
Overcharging
Start/stop system errors
Premature battery failure
Warning lights

Ilikejdmcars (Score: 1): You‚Äôll be fine. Some cars like bmw and Audi need to be reprogrammed after replacing the battery but yours won‚Äôt need to. Intelligent Battery Sensors monitor the battery's age and capacity, and the car's computer adjusts the alternator's charging rate. When a new battery is installed without this process, the car will continue to charge it based on the old battery's data."

1ocojzb,Should I Replace the O-Rings on my Fuel Injectors?,"Howdy,

The valve cover gasket got a nasty leak on my 2016 1.5l turbo chevy Malibu and I'm currently ordering parts to replace it. I've tinkered a bit here and there on older cars with friends but this will be the first time I'm ripping into something this new. I've watched plenty of videos on the process and it all seems pretty straightforward, especially because my buddy works at a shop that lets them wrench their cars there on the weekends so I don't have to worry about not having the right tools.

I'm currently ordering parts for the repair and erring on the side of caution by ordering additional components that might need to be replaced when I pull them. Right now I have the two valve cover gaskets (no shit), a bunch of the PCV hose system shit (the connections are basically designed to break on removal thx chevy), and a vacuum pump gasket in my cart, but I am wondering if there is anything else I'm missing.

Originally I was going to order all new fuel injectors but the price point made me shy away from that pretty damn quick. What I am worried about is the o-rings on the fuel injectors as well as the fuel rail (another element that chevy claims is ""one time use"" but I call bs). I've also heard mixed opinions on if you should replace all the valve cover bolts after doing this repair and was looking for some more takes. Just wondering if there are any other components that I should consider buying here to save my ass incase shit goes south. I'd rather over order now and return later then have to tow it back to my house because I need to wait a week on some piece.

Well if it's the piston rings that have worn down, there is nothing you can do that can unwear them. You can try hi mileage oil. You can try heavier weight oil. They may help but the oil consumption will not go away. 

Even with a junkyard engine you're still looking at a couple of thousand bucks to deal with this problem at least.

You gotta decide if it's worth it to tea r that engine down to see if it is the rings. Remember too that if there is anything else wrong that is uncovered in the teardown you will have to fix that as well.

1ockjpu,Starting issues.,"Vehicle: 2013 Chrysler Town and country. 

Fault code P0016 crank sensor. Part now replaced. Fault code erased. 

A little history. A few weeks back my car threw that code.  This is a used vehicle At 214k km. 

Yesterday I was stranded at a job site as the vehicle wouldn't turn over. The starter works but it just wouldn't start. The battery is fine. My foreman blasted some engine start and it fired up. I drove to the grocery store(30 minute drive) and was stranded after shutting it off. Tried spraying it but it wouldn't start so I had to get a tow truck to bring my vehicle home. 

This morning had to call into work because the vehicle wouldn't start. So I went ahead and replaced the crank sensor. Same thing, it wouldn't start. I got my wife to turn it over as I sprayed it and it fired up. I let it idol for an hour just to make sure it was safe. I figured it just needed a small boost and it'll read the new sensor and all is well. 

We went for a drive and now my transmission shifts perfect, it's running pretty nice. Went to go get an oil change. Did the routine ""ok turn your vehicle back on so we can check"". It fired right up. Major anxiety but I was happy and I told them the issues I was having. 

So the car was off again. and when it was time to leave the car wouldn't start. Same issue so they pushed it out for me. I blasted it with quick start and it started fine. Driving 20 minutes home with no issues. No stuttering or hard transmission shifts. No electrical issues. It idols fine as well. It's not like it randomly revs up and down for no reason.

I've recently started going to the native reserves to get gas. Could it be a gas quality issue? If it were, there would be more reports of that type of incident online.

When I was at the auto parts store today I asked about a fuel filter but there wasn't one in their system. So I'm assuming this vehicle only has the filter pad as a filter inside the tank? If it does actually have one?

I haven't replaced the spark plugs but these issues have been popping up ever since that code came up. 

If it was a timing issue you would think spray wouldn't start it at all and it would run like crap while it was running.

There are a multitude of parts and reasons why I'm having issues but any direction is welcomed. Thanks.

Now for the second bit, pls help me convince my husband that we should get it replaced soon. Whether its considered ""dangerous"" or not, this is not supposed to happen and is something that should be fixed before it keeps getting worse

However, it seems like Bob Vila never actually tested it, since the review states: ""To be fair, we don‚Äôt have a way to test this wrench‚Äôs accuracy, so the calibration certificate had to be good enough for us.""

However, aside from the price, there are some other red flags. First, Summit Tools seems to exist only on Amazon. I can't find any website, social media, or other marketing presence. Additionally, the exact same model number (WEP4-200CN) shows up under a different brand called ""HOUZTUL."" Also, when I search for reviews on YouTube, there's basically nothing except what look like AI-generated slideshows.

The Amazon page doesn't say anything about where it's manufactured, but I think it's pretty safe to assume this is a white label Chinese product. Still, I was just curious if anyone has actually used one of these? Does it hold calibration? Is the customer service real if something goes wrong?

For context, I'm doing occasional auto work (brakes, oil, minor engine stuff). I own a Pittsburgh 1/2"" click-type which I use for lug nuts, caliper and caliper bracket bolts, and other things that don't risk cracking the cylinder head (replacing the oil pressure sensor was a sweaty palms situation). Would I be better off with a Quinn digital adapter or something like that? Should I just save up for a better torque wrench?

1occlex,"Audi A6 2020 2.0 TDI Mild Hybrid ‚Äì Garage says alternator ‚Äúdefective‚Äù (13.1 V), but my multimeter readings seem fine. Thoughts?","Hey everyone

I have an Audi A6 2020 2.0 TDI mild-hybrid (48 V MHEV), and I wanted to double-check something about the charging voltage.

During a recent inspection in Germany, a garage wrote in the report:

>13.11V - Alternator Defect!

And they told me that I should change my Alternator, which costs around 2-3k Euros

Audi Germany later told me 13.1 V is actually *in order* for this model, but I wanted to verify myself.

So I used a digital multimeter (AstroAI AM33D) and measured at the jump-start post and chassis ground.

Here are my results:

|Condition|Voltage (V)|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Engine off (resting)|12.44 V|Battery healthy|
|Engine running (no load)|13.14 ‚Äì 13.49 V|Normal charging|
|Engine running (full load: A/C, headlights, heated mirrors, rear defogger, etc.)|13.18 V|Very stable|
|Engine off (after shutdown)|12.11 ‚Üí 12.30 V after 2 min|Normal recovery|

Everything seems rock-solid, and the voltage holds steady under load.

I understand the A6 mild-hybrid uses a 48 V belt-starter-generator + DC-DC converter, which keeps the 12 V system around 13.0‚Äì13.5 V instead of the old-school 14.4 V range.

Still, that first garage‚Äôs comment (‚Äúalternator defective‚Äù) made me doubt it a bit.

What do you think?  
Are these values exactly what other MHEV A6 owners see, or should I still be suspicious of the 13.1 V figure?

Thanks in advance ‚Äî I‚Äôd love to hear if anyone has similar measurements or dealer feedback. üôè",1,1761052363.0,5,MechanicAdvice,1761161716,2025-10-21 13:12:43,2025-10-22 19:35:16,"RickMN (Score: 1): 13.18 with full load is too low.

RedDRevenger (Score: 1): The 48v mild hybrid charges at 47-49 volts, the alternator only charges the 48v battery which in turn converts it to the 12v system. What your seeing is the converter doing it's job, eventually the 48 volt system will die and then the 12 volt will die as there's no charging voltage from the alternator.

EDIT: On a side note, the 48v starter/generator has a recall, 27BQ i would recommend doing a vin search and see if it apply to your vehicle. There have also been multiple warranty extensions on these generators aswell"

Just replaced the EGR sensor**.** Other suggestions are replacing the Exhaust Valve in cylinder one (more expensive than this car is worth), that it's the oil pressure sensor and someone else suggested strengthening the engine mounts. After the EGR sensor replacement last Friday, they checked for any other errors with their computer system and they said it was clear.

1oc9dma,"Mitsubishi Colt 2011 with LPG system ‚Äî gas switch light flashing, check engine light on, and coolant leak","Hi everyone,
I have a 2011 Mitsubishi Colt with an LPG (autogas) system installed. For the past few weeks, the small light next to the 4 green lights on the LPG switch has been flashing on and off occasionally, but quite calmly. The check engine light was not on back then.

However, since yesterday, the check engine light came on, and the LPG switch light started flashing much more intensely ‚Äî almost hysterically.

I also recently discovered that I‚Äôve apparently been driving for weeks without coolant. I only noticed it two days ago, when the coolant reservoir was completely empty. I refilled it, because I was going on a 500km trip a few hours later for one day. The next day (yesterday) i drove 300km (so now 800 in total in 2 days.) But when I checked under my hood again after the trips, the coolant was completely empty again. So I am guessing somewhere on the way back from my second trip the car got too hot and it did not have coolant (cause of leaking somewhere) so something maybe overheated in the gas system? On the way back my check engine light came on also and the LPG switch began flickering hysterically shortly after later on the day. 

Does anyone have an idea what could be causing this combination of issues? Could the coolant leak and the LPG system behavior be connected somehow?

Thanks in advance for any help or advice!

Other option might be ignition coils going bad, again there would be a code with the cylinder that misfired due to the coil failure.

Roasted_Goldfish (Score: 12): Piston rings are a very overlooked aspect of engine design. The choice of rings and how they're implemented have a HUGE impact on fuel efficiency, reliability, oil consumption, and performance. Stronger/tighter rings = lower oil consumption, higher strength for boost/greater power potential at the cost of worse fuel economy and increased parasitic loss. Weaker/looser rings give you higher efficiency (less parasitic loss = more power and efficiency) at the risk of less reliability, increased oil consumption, and less tolerance to abuse (power levels over stock, suboptimal maintenance etc). The sealing of the combustion chamber and scraping of oil off the cylinder walls to prevent oil consumption is a very careful balancing act

1och8u1,Jacking a vehicle using the control arm,"I have read so many of this question and it seems your mistaking what jacking the control arm means.

So most normal vehicles have 4 wheels 2 control arms in the front. The control arm controls the up and down going over bumps etc. 

You can jack the tire off the ground safley using just the control arm 
as long as its done right.

I do it all the time no issues ever but if you do not understand what it means to jack it from the control arm i wouldnt do it.

You do not jack the control arm from where it attached to the car you put the jack close to the wheel and lift the control arm up it will raise the tire offbthe ground and minimal pressure is applied on the jack because your lifing just the tire off the ground the vehicle still has 3 wheels on the ground which is where the weight is . 

Now with that said if you jack the car up
On the connecting point to the vehicle you will damage the control arm because your putting 2000-4000 lbs on the control arm.

Its simple mechanics really and a understanding of what it means to jack a car fron the control arm.

So simply put its ok to jack the tire up using just the control arm but not safe to lift the vehicle from the control arm.

Even if you do it right tech if the jack fails or moves etc you could have the arm come crashing down and wreck the components or the vehicle itself. I would reccomend the proper way which is use a car jack rated for the proper weight and use jack stands always.

Can it be done yes . Is it reccomended no.

Hope this helps you understand.

Two months ago the entire transmission was replaced along with an engine solenoid  
Then about a week later a crack was found at a connection point that was leaking & our whole radiator needed replaced. 

  
Fast forward to know, we have zero driving issues. Nothing is leaking. Van drives great. Then today, the check engine light comes on out of nowhere with codes (P0420 & P0706). Autozone report says we need a new catalytic convertor & we are beyond tired of dumping money into this van. The employee suggested trying cataclean to see if hopefully its just dirty & that about 8 out of 10 people reported it helping them. 

  
Is the cataclean worth a try or is it simply a waste of $27? With the van having zero driving issues at the moment, how urgent is it that we get this code taken care of.

Personal and professional opinion, no. 

Some people online say no, some people online say yes. Is it worth $27? Sure, why not.

Is it possible the issue comes back within 11 months and you're screwed for emissions testing? Probably. 

> how urgent is it that we get this code taken care of

Not at all, if your converter was clogged you'd know. If it's just worn out and setting codes, it doesn't affect your drivability it just makes you fail emissions testing.

Lkn4it (Score: 3): P0420 is not always a bad catalytic converter. That is just telling you that the downstream O2 sensor is not sending the correct signal.

The downstream O2 sensor is the last piece in the emissions system. Anything wrong before this can cause a P0420 code. 

Start your van. Hold the engine to 3,000 rpm for a few minutes until it is at temp. Hold a sheet of paper over the exhaust pipe at idle. 

If the paper stays blowing out, your catalytic is probably good. 

If the paper starts popping in and out of the exhaust, your catalytic is probably blocked. 

I had a Honda CR-V that would throw P0420 when the air filter was dirty. 

The best way to tell what is needed is to connect a real time analyzer and see what is going on. 

I would be suspicious of the downstream O2 sensor if I got this code after a transmission replacement. I would check for loose connections or broken or pinched wires on the O2 sensor.

Epotheros (Score: 2): It really depends on how bad your cat is. On slightly fouled cats and fuel systems it can still clean up some minor build up. On a cat that is actually clogged up or collapsed it will do nothing.

My anecdotal take: Back in 2018 my 96 TBird threw a P0420 code. I drove the gas tank down to an 1/8th, filled it up to a 1/4 with 91 octane, put in a bottle of cataclean, and drove it hard on the highway for about 20 miles. I then filled it up with regular 87 and reset the light. It took 12 months for the light to come back on. 

When it came back on in 2019 I did the same procedure and the light stayed off for almost 6 years. The light came back in Dec. 2025 and I just got the cats replaced this summer, because Cataclean didn't work this time."

1occbuh,"Audi A6 2020 2.0 TDI Mild Hybrid ‚Äì Garage says alternator ‚Äúdefective‚Äù (13.1 V), but my multimeter readings seem fine. Thoughts?","Hey everyone

I have an **Audi A6 2020 2.0 TDI mild-hybrid (48 V MHEV)**, and I wanted to double-check something about the charging voltage.

During a recent inspection in Germany, a **garage wrote in the report:**

>13.11V - Alternator Defect!

And they told me that I should change my Alternator, which costs around 2-3k Euros

Audi Germany later told me 13.1 V is actually *in order* for this model, but I wanted to verify myself.

So I used a **digital multimeter (AstroAI AM33D)** and measured at the jump-start post and chassis ground.

Here are my results:

|Condition|Voltage (V)|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Engine off (resting)|12.44 V|Battery healthy|
|Engine running (no load)|13.14 ‚Äì 13.49 V|Normal charging|
|Engine running (full load: A/C, headlights, heated mirrors, rear defogger, etc.)|13.18 V|Very stable|
|Engine off (after shutdown)|12.11 ‚Üí 12.30 V after 2 min|Normal recovery|

Everything seems rock-solid, and the voltage holds steady under load.

I understand the A6 mild-hybrid uses a **48 V belt-starter-generator + DC-DC converter**, which keeps the 12 V system around 13.0‚Äì13.5 V instead of the old-school 14.4 V range.

Still, that first garage‚Äôs comment (‚Äúalternator defective‚Äù) made me doubt it a bit.

**What do you think?**  
Are these values exactly what other MHEV A6 owners see, or should I still be suspicious of the 13.1 V figure?

The problem is that engine was gunked up because conventional leaves tar if not changed on time. It definitely was not changed on time.

Oil pump seal is a resin. But because of running conventional past the mileage it became a brittle plastic.

Despite it being a plastic screen not resin cover anymore, it still stayed in place.

My full synthetic oil has better viscosity and cleaning abilities so it blew past the plastic seal by cleaning the tar which acted like a sealant.

It could have lasted more on conventional and better oil uncovered the issue.

I think most reports of issues switching from conventional to synthetic are selection bias. If you have a 400,000km car and switch it from conventional to synthetic and it starts leaking, was it the oil, or was it the 400,000km? I think the latter.

When you try and accelerate, it will try to stay in the same gear until throttle input exceeds a programmed point, at which point it will downshift, your engine will gain RPMs to generate more power and then up shift once again when the extra power is not needed.

1oco4n7,"Oil Change Interval Question 2018 Honda Civic 2.0L, 90k Miles","Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve always followed the ‚Äúevery 3,000 miles‚Äù oil change rule because that‚Äôs what my dad taught me. But I keep hearing newer advice that says synthetic oil can easily last 7,000‚Äì8,000 miles or more. Now I‚Äôm a bit confused.

For reference:

* **Car:** 2018 Honda Civic
* **Engine:** 2.0L
* **Mileage:** \~90,000 miles
* **Oil type:** Full synthetic
* **Driving:** Mostly short city trips, some highway

I‚Äôve been doing oil changes every 5,000 miles using synthetic oil since I bought the car. The oil gets dark by then, but the car runs fine no loss in power, no burning smell, nothing strange.

A couple of mechanics have given me opposite advice:

* One said 8,000 miles is fine with synthetic.
* Another said I‚Äôm ‚Äúpushing it‚Äù after 4,000.

Now I‚Äôm wondering what‚Äôs actually reasonable here.

From what I‚Äôve gathered, it depends on:

* Driving conditions (short trips vs. long highway runs)
* Engine design and oil temperature
* Filter quality
* Oil life monitor accuracy

I don‚Äôt totally trust the oil life monitor does it actually *measure* oil quality, or just estimate based on driving patterns?

So my questions to the folks here:

* How often do you recommend oil changes for synthetic oil in cars like mine?
* Do you rely on the oil life monitor, or just stick to mileage?
* Have you ever seen real engine damage from stretching an oil change too long?

Appreciate any insights or real-world experiences. I just want to make sure I‚Äôm not wasting good oil or risking the engine either.

Fault code P0016 crank sensor. Part now replaced. Fault code erased. 

A little history. A few weeks back my car threw that code.  This is a used vehicle At 214k km. 

Yesterday I was stranded at a job site as the vehicle wouldn't turn over. The starter works but it just wouldn't start. The battery is fine. My foreman blasted some engine start and it fired up. I drove to the grocery store(30 minute drive) and was stranded after shutting it off. Tried spraying it but it wouldn't start so I had to get a tow truck to bring my vehicle home. 

This morning had to call into work because the vehicle wouldn't start. So I went ahead and replaced the crank sensor. Same thing, it wouldn't start. I got my wife to turn it over as I sprayed it and it fired up. I let it idol for an hour just to make sure it was safe. I figured it just needed a small boost and it'll read the new sensor and all is well. 

We went for a drive and now my transmission shifts perfect, it's running pretty nice. Went to go get an oil change. Did the routine ""ok turn your vehicle back on so we can check"". It fired right up. Major anxiety but I was happy and I told them the issues I was having. 

So the car was off again. and when it was time to leave the car wouldn't start. Same issue so they pushed it out for me. I blasted it with quick start and it started fine. Driving 20 minutes home with no issues. No stuttering or hard transmission shifts. No electrical issues. It idols fine as well. It's not like it randomly revs up and down for no reason.

I've recently started going to the native reserves to get gas. Could it be a gas quality issue? If it were, there would be more reports of that type of incident online.

When I was at the auto parts store today I asked about a fuel filter but there wasn't one in their system. So I'm assuming this vehicle only has the filter pad as a filter inside the tank? If it does actually have one?

I haven't replaced the spark plugs but these issues have been popping up ever since that code came up. 

If it was a timing issue you would think spray wouldn't start it at all and it would run like crap while it was running.

There are a multitude of parts and reasons why I'm having issues but any direction is welcomed. Thanks.

1ocj3wq,Crate Engine for a 2010 Yukon Denali?,"Need some insight here. We have a 2010 GMC Yukon Denali (160K miles). The engine went out on it and the issue was damaged lifters/camshaft. Apparently, this is a common issue with this vehicle. The price to put in a new engine or a rebuilt engine was about $8-$10K. The problem is I owe about $9K on it right now, so dropping a new engine isn't the right choice in my opinion.

Recently, I made friends with a young guy at my church who is a mechanic. He was telling me about a crate engine, and he showed me some for about $1,500 - $2,000. He said he'd put it in for $2K. I've never heard of a crate engine before, but I'm not a mechanic so maybe that's not saying much. He did another fix on my car and he's good.

What do you know about crate engines? Are they good? I looked just a minute ago and the ones in those price ranges are used of course. Where do I get them? What should I watch out for?

Lastly, I would be replacing this engine and selling the car, hoping to break even. I just don't want to keep paying on a $9K car that just sits in my driveway.

Play with the offset and length of the message you are feeding to the CRC algo. It might also be seeded with a certain value. Being that it's only 16-bit CRC, it's trivial to just brute force that part until you find it. What gets harder is if they're using a non-standard table.

So you shouldn't need both. 

Make sure that the Mini USB cable you're using has data, as some chinese cables are power only. Also, it seems that the power circuitry isn't switching on and only the LEDs are powered, hence the <10mA. If you supply over 7V, you should see a current draw of at least 50mA (guesstimate).

1obynxp,What is the best option when transplanting an engine?,"So my Grandfather has asked to help me with his project car and I need some advice on how to best approach the problem. So he has an old suzuki jeep and has put a 2014 lexus is250 engine and transmission inside it. And as mechanically inclined as he is, he knows very little about the electronics and computers in cars. So hes asked me to get it running as I know slightly more then him. I know a little bit but I have never done anything this intense. 

Now he personally thinks I should get the original ecu working again but I feel like that is an extremely difficult task. He has the engine wiring harness an ecu, the injector controller, the transmission controller, and the immobilizer switch with a key. I feel like we are missing important components and getting the immobilizer to talk with the ecu seem quite difficult. We also dont have an obdII port to talk to the electronics. 

What I think we should do is rig up a custom controller with something like megasquirt or arduino.  Hooking everything up to the engine, programming and tuning the engine seem difficult but possible. However I am worried about getting the automatic transmission to work with the custom controller. I know a lot less about automatic transmission than I do engines. Idk even know where to start with this transmission. Do I somehow hook up a custom transmission controller to the engine or do I try and tie in the factory transmission controller with a custom engine controller?

fig15newton (Score: 3): Given the list of stock parts that you already have, that would 100% be the way to go if you‚Äôre mating it with a stock transmission and you‚Äôre not feeling adventurous. You will likely need some additional modules, but IMHO this is easier than trying to drive a newer automatic transmission.

**Also, fair warning:** the specifics of MPX and later model Toyota key auth (mentioned later) are stretching my knowledge.

Based on [this diagram](https://fixmycarinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lexus-IS-250C-XE20-2014-Wiring-Diagrams.pdf) (I sure hope is accurate :) it looks like this car may only have one CAN bus (nice!). The DLC3 ‚Äî Toyota-speak for OBD2 port ‚Äî is simply off that main CAN bus. The very first thing I would recommend adding is an OBD2 connector so you can start to dump info and/or use an OBD2 scan tool.

To get things wired up correctly (with what you have) you‚Äôd likely want a 120-ohm resistor to take the place of the Network Gateway ECU (page 105) and probably a second to take the place of the other termination resistor (I‚Äôm not sure where it would be). In the end there should be \~60Œ© between CAN High and CAN Low (test with everything off). If you add additional modules you may have to adjust the terminator resitors. This might be enough wiring to get a usable signal or ""link"" out of the OBD2 port. I'd try some kind of OBD2 code scanner or (better) TIS. Even better -- if you have the means -- an oscilloscope or logic analyzer to see if there's any activity.

As mentioned before, just the modules you have probably aren't enough to get this working all the way. If you don't already have them, I think you'll need

* Certification ECU
* ID Code Box
* Main Body ECU
* Network Gateway ECU

The ID code box stores the ID of the learned keys and connects to to the Certification ECU over a LIN bus. The Certification ECU then connects back to the BCM (Main Body ECU) over Toyota's MPX. The MPX lines then connect the Network Gateway ECU which can exchange data over e.g. CAN. From here I think you would have the necessary parts to get the system started -- assuming the key is authorized.

From my understanding of Toyota's MPX protocol you can skip modules since it simply forms a logical ring with each node in the loop passing on all messages received on one port."

Worn brakes won't cause the symptoms your describing which is basically what we call  ""death wobble"". Worn tires? Yes, they can definitely cause this issue I've seen it multiple times, however thats usually caused by another issue specifically in the suspension, eg worn ball joints, WORN BUSHINGS, broken tie rods, worn wheel bearings, even an 'off' alignment. HOWEVER I SAY ""USUALLY"" because another thing that can cause tires to go bad is again alignment or if your continuously driving over surfaces that are at weird angles or uneven. BUT EVEN THEN, if you can't go over 20mph without having significant death wobble, then I highly doubt it would be worn tires.

Now you say your not mechanically inclined however you seem to know what a control arm is and what bushings are, and the fact you have other people saying the bushing as well and apparently they know what they're talking about, then I'm going to go ahead and rule out the wheel bearings and ball joints, however I highly recommend you get those checked out too.

It was previously a rental in Hawaii so I knew it was probably going to be worse than if it came from Arizona or something, but everything is orange underneath and covered in rust dust. How bad is it and how much time do I have before starting to see something fail?

Got this from Carmax and unfortunately just a week outside of the 10 day return policy, but still within the 90 day/4000 mile Carmax warranty.

The right-side pull could also point to uneven tire wear, alignment issues, or even a slightly dragging brake caliper.   
  
First step is to check tire pressure and inspect the tires for cupping or uneven wear. If that looks fine, a quick wheel bearing or CV joint inspection at a local shop or DIY lift check can usually pinpoint it.

When bleeding the system, it doesn't show any signs of loss or air bubbles. Only after driving do I lose anything, hence why I'm thinking the cats are getting too hot.

1ocjceh,Replacing spark plugs after 8 years,"It is time to replace the plugs on our 2018 XC60.  I'm going to put OEM Denso iridium plugs back in to replace the factory plugs.  Denso specifies the new plugs be installed dry without anti-seize; however, the factory plugs were surprisingly hard to get out of the head.  Removing them was not the easiest, and they squeaked and chattered the whole way coming out.  After breaking the initial torque to loosen them, I thought I'd be able to just turn the socket extension to remove them, but they were so tight in the threads that I needed the socket wrench to turn them out the whole way.  Looking at the threads, there is a fair amount of what looks like corrosion or combustion debris accumulated on the threads.



My question is this: Would a light coat of anti-seize on the bottom of the threads (away from the electrode) help to prevent this in the future?  I understand Denso specifies they be installed dry, but after 8 years of heat cycling, it seems like the nickel/zinc plating on the threads is pretty tired and not really doing its job that well.  I would obviously reduce specified torque by 25-30% if applying anti-seize.



Am I overthinking this, or do people still see plugs that specify dry installation getting corroded in place after so many years in the head?

1ocivaa,Could a bad wheel bearing cause swaying and repeated alignment problems?,"I am having this really frustrating problem with my car and nobody can seem to figure out what the issue is. I have a 2020 Honda Accord. The backstory, I had a wheel bearing go bad and it was replaced by a private mechanic. It was shortly after the replacement that I started having this weird swaying feel in the suspension, like the car just wouldn‚Äôt hold a straight line and there was this excess play in the wheel that was unusual for my car. It wouldn‚Äôt be really noticeable just driving for a brief period of time at really low speeds, but it would definitely come out at regular-higher speeds and on several different types of roads.¬†

I have taken my car back to have this issue addressed several times. I took it back to the original mechanic who did the repair, a different mechanic for a second a opinion, and then to the dealership twice. Each time I would take it in, the alignment would be significantly off balance. But they would check everything underneath the car and insist everything was operating normally. That the struts were good, the ball joints were good, nothing appeared to be loose or bent. They would drive the car and tell me they couldn't replicate the issue. So they do the alignment and send me off.¬†

I end up still having the same exact swaying problem only a few days after the alignment. I take it in again, and the alignment ends up significantly off balance again. Not even just a little bit off, I‚Äôm talking like several degrees off to the point where it doesn‚Äôt even show the arrow on the chart. The toe value specifically always ends up being like 60 degrees off balance.¬†

But again, they tell me that nothing is wrong, they can‚Äôt feel anything wrong, and they just do the alignment and send me off. The dealership tells me the same exact thing. But it never holds the alignment and ends up way off balance again only a week or two later. My most recent visit to the dealership, they told me they inspected it thoroughly, and they gave me this convoluted explanation that they used an impact drill to tighten the rear subframe and that might fix it. It just sounded to me like they just ‚Äúdid something‚Äù just to say they did. I end up still having the same exact swaying issue.¬†

I keep telling every place I go to, that this happened after I had a wheel bearing replaced. But they keep insisting that a wheel bearing couldn‚Äôt cause something like this, and they won‚Äôt check it out. They acknowledge that it‚Äôs odd how the alignment keeps falling out of place, but that they can‚Äôt figure out why. They just keep doing repeated alignments that never actually fix the problem.¬†

So, is it true that a wheel bearing could never cause an issue like this? Or is it possible that the replacement wheel bearing is the issue?¬†",1,1761066967.0,4,AskMechanics,1761161716,2025-10-21 17:16:07,2025-10-22 19:35:16,"Waste_Eagle_2414 (Score: 1): I‚Äôve learned to never say never, but if they replaced the wheel hub/bearing assembly then it seems unlikely, if it was done right and a quality part was used.

Gold-Fall3790 (Score: 2): I‚Äôm going through something similar, except mine would start once then the ECM would go into protection mode and wouldn‚Äôt start again for 5 minutes. I think I have it traced to the braided power wire that connects the starter to the solenoid. It is highly frayed and oxidized and it broke when I inspected it. I think that was causing high resistance and voltage fluctuations when cranking which could have tripped the ECM protection.

In your case, one thing you could do after visually inspecting the starter is pull the starter relay with the car powered down and jump the constant 12v lead to the other side with a heavy piece of wire. Do this at your own risk, it shouldn‚Äôt screw up anything but you never know. The relay is purple and the correct leads are the ones that are copper colored. Watch some YouTube videos on ‚Äújumping starter relay‚Äù. Also look for corrosion on the cables and the negative cable ground. 

Anyway, this will cause the starter to run and will turn over the engine. You can probably rule out the starter after that. If you need to replace the starter, it‚Äôs easy. Just remove the air box and ducts. The starter itself may have corrosion where it mounts and you may have to carefully pry it out with a pry bar moving side to side. If it‚Äôs not the starter, just find a good diagnostic mechanic and let them figure it out, chasing ECM and CAN bus problems is a massive pain."

1occqzr,Electric Solutions,"Recently I was faced with several power issues with my car and I thought it would be a good idea to trickle charge my battery because I hadn't driven the car for almost 2 weeks. Like an idiot, I reversed polarity on the battery when reconnecting the terminals and hence a lot of problems. 

Long story short, I had a new alternator fitted on the advice of a breakdown engineer. But the auto mechanic who assisted in the installation of the alternator said it was my main fuse which had blown, the 120 Amp, which powers the alternator. In fact he said that it was unnecessary for me to have the alternator fitted in the first place. This was the reason he said that my car kept breaking down. 

Anyway that's by the by really although I was annoyed at the breakdown engineer from the AA for what should have been a routine test that he failed to perform. After the fuse was changed the car ran fine but the electrics remain damaged. The dashboard does not illuminate, the stereo doesn't work and neither does the dash cam. 
Most importantly though, the back lights do not work which mean I cannot take it on the road. 

The other day I tested all the fuses in the car and found that all of them had continuity. I then tested the voltage and almost every function was ruining below 12 volts. On average arround 11.75 which obviously is too low.

I am not very experienced with mechanics at all but I like to try and fix things for myself when I can. I feel now that I am a little out of my depth. I used various AI programs for advice and it seems now that this maybe something to do with wiring and various other parts that I have no experience of dealing with before. I recently tried fitting a crankshaft sensor but in the end I had to enlist the services of a professional to do the job correctly. 

Now Grok is telling me to check ground connections, BCM module and fuseboard input, but doesn't properly explain how I should go about doing this.

In general, with all of the electronic sensors and computers in modern vehicles which can be fairly sensitive, I wouldn't risk it even briefly to test the idea.

The positive alone from a different battery is not completing any kind of circuit, so nothing would happen, but positive and negative both from the second battery obviously will create a completed circuit. You'd probably get some sparks, and it could interrupt other circuits in the vehicle's electrical system, if your question is assuming the vehicle's battery is also still connected. Depending on amperage or the size of the cable used, and the length of time, this might be more or less likely. When welding on a vehicle, for an example with high power circuits, the vehicle's battery should be disconnected first.

1oc9iz8,3800 series II question,"This has bothered me for a long time because no one has ever given me a straight answer.

I had a 97' Camaro 3800 t5 with about 180xxxkm.

One morning I came out and it was -27c out. I started the car and it wouldn't idle. I tried figuring it out but it was too damn cold.

I ended up bringing it to a mechanic.

He found the maf housing was cracked and was pivoting slightly and was causing it to act random. Sometimes idle sometimes not.

I paid and got my car and drove home.

The next day I am driving and the car starts to rev to 5k or so. Just sending itself down the road. It was very random and I found out I could make it go away by turning the car on and off. I got stuck in traffic one time with that rev problem it was a nightmare.

Long story short I took it back to him and explained the issue. He did say he took the throttle body off to clean it because it was dirty. So I wondered maybe something was acting on the throttle plate or something. He didn't care and pretty much told me to get lost. I wanted to tear that place apart lol.

But yeah so then I had a car that revved by itself whenever it felt like it.

I went to the junk yard and got every sensor I could find off of the 3800's so I could mess around and maybe figure it out.

The motor eventually had lifter failure that wiped out the cam and just before that my fuel pump failed.

I parted the car and never figured out the revving issue.

I took the heads off the motor because I always wanted to see inside a motor. 

Lots of carbon on the pistons. Deep scoring in the cylinder walls. I seafoamed the car a couple times maybe some chunks broke free.

Backstory / Repair Timeline

1Ô∏è‚É£ First Visit ‚Äì Initial Fix Attempt:
I originally noticed suspension-related noise and determined the struts needed replacement. I took the car to my local mechanic and had both struts replaced. I expected this to eliminate the noise, but it didn‚Äôt solve the issue.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Second Visit ‚Äì New Noise, Driver Side Thud/Knock:
Shortly after, a new thud/knock appeared from the driver‚Äôs side. Based on research, I suspected the sway bar links, so I returned to the same shop and had them replaced. The sound persisted.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Third Visit ‚Äì More Front-End Components Replaced:
Since the sound was still present, I went back and had the outer tie rods, ball joints, control arms, and sway bar bushings replaced. After this round of repairs, the noise was FINALLY gone‚Äîfor a short time.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Fourth Visit (Current Problem) ‚Äì Same Noise, Opposite Side:
A new but similar thud/knock began occurring, now coming from the passenger side. In addition, the steering knock (while parked), creaking when accelerating, and thud when braking started happening. Believing inner tie rods were the last possible worn parts, I had them replaced along with the boot. I just picked the car up, but all symptoms remain unchanged.


---

My Concern

At this point, nearly every major front-end suspension and steering component has been replaced, yet the noises continue. I‚Äôm unsure if:

Something was installed incorrectly,

A part is loose or not torqued properly,

A component (e.g., strut mount, clunking CV axle, engine/transmission mount, subframe bushing, rack and pinion, etc.) is failing but hasn't been checked,

Or if something is being repeatedly overlooked.


I trust this shop since I‚Äôve had family members receive great service here, which makes this even more confusing. I‚Äôm worried there may be an underlying issue that‚Äôs not being properly diagnosed.


---

Any insight, possible overlooked causes, or diagnostic suggestions would be hugely appreciated. Thank you so much for your help!

Car overheating to hell a month after I first got it due to thermostat housing implosion. Then 2 weeks later the repleacement one broke to. A month after that the temperature control valve breaks in half. Two weeks after that the car had a major misfire and thick heavy dense smoke came out the tailpipe. I let the car sit for 2 hours, put cadaclean in it and it went away for a few months with no misfires.

It might be that the Goodyears, at that psi are, for want of a better description, riding on the sidewalls i.e. the tyre footprint pressure distribution is being concentrated towards the outside of the tyre rather than centre making the tyre slow to respond to the interaction between geometry and road surface.

Go out on a familiar route at current pressure to fix in your mind the feel then try adding +2psi and repeating. 

Do this for a few runs up to the manufacturers recommended PSI for a full passenger & luggage load. Ideally you will feel an improvement as you progress through pressures out to the other side where handling starts to degrade. That'll identify the 'window' of where you feel handling is best then you can focus on those pressures to hopefully find your happy place. 

There will be an interaction between front and rear axles so start with the rear, get happy with that then do the front, you may find the balance shifts so be prepared to put a day in to it.

Another thought is that some VAG cars' geometry settings are, from factory set for a 'Full/heavy' load, this can mean that when lightly loaded i.e. just you, the rear ""Sits Up"" and rides on the outer sidewalls on the rear; a few years ago I was seeing a lot of VAG vehicles (Passats mostly iirc) with bad feathering/irregular block wear on rear inside tryes as they were not being loaded correctly. 

There was a modified recommended geometry floating about various user forums but they may be lost to time as this was around 2015/16. Whilst your Audi is likelky newer than that it may be another avenue of investigation.

1ocn7gz,Experiences of selling a car via an auction site (Motorway),"There are 4 options selling a car: Private, part-exchange, sites like WeBuyAnyCar and auction sites like Motorway. With the promise of less hassle, I have now tried Motorway.



Today, I sold my beloved albeit aging Golf GTi. Aesthetically, it has age related blemishes, all declared. Mechanically, as far as I know, all sound.



First bidder didn‚Äôt bother turning up forcing a re-listing. New bidder‚Äôs bid was quite generous and eagerly turned up the day after. 



By the time he‚Äôd finished going over it with a fine tooth comb and positing nightmare scenarios of imminent failure, he‚Äôd dropped his offer to less than what PX or WBAC had offered. Only after prolonged haggling in the street did I manage to get him above that level. And only by a tiny amount. Frankly, it really wasn‚Äôt worth the hassle.



What I‚Äôve learned is despite the advertising, there are no options that do not involve some level of haggling. PX and WBAC probably have the least. Private sales have the most. Motorway sell the idea that their service is haggle-free. This is not true.



They auction your car to dealers. Dealers gonna haggle. They're dealers. Maybe if your car is a relatively new pristine example, there‚Äôs less room for haggle. But for any normal used car of some age, get ready to haggle or be taken to the cleaners.



It is apparent the bid a dealer makes will be overinflated and is merely a foot in the door to get first dibs. They have no intention of honouring that bid. They will nitpick on your car in determination to justify reneging on their bid. You will not get what they bid. Period.



Given this, you might as well have sold your car private and avoided Motorway‚Äôs fees which will affect how much the dealer will be able to offer you. This service is not free. You pay for it by the back door.



So in short, I personally will not be using one of these auction sites again.

1oclz6k,¬£95 Rover update,"Check post history for context.

I finally managed to get some time of uni only for a few hours and drove all the way back home earlier to properly inspect the Rover and to take some better photos of it to explicate its condition a bit better. The electronics were completely dead ofc as the battery is old.

First of all, as many of you have told me (as well as ChatGPT), the clutch is likely ok (symptoms reminder: highish biting point, shifter would struggle to get into gear, shifter would get stuck and car would stall and take a few times to restart only if it stalled, otherwise it would fire right up). I‚Äôve asked forums and google but I am struggling to get an answer, but I believe the best first course of action is to change the brake fluid as this 2002 model uses a hydraulic clutch? How do I do that, apparently the system is not bleedable although some people say it is so im sort of confused lol. It‚Äôs a 2002 Rover 45 II 16v manual if that helps.

The brake fluid itself is topped up (attached a photo at end), I hope I checked the right reservoir lol, but the colour is brownish, so I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs old and needs to be flushed out?

Also rust wise, results are excellent but I have attached photos in case I have missed anything.

I did the milky oil filler cap check and there was no horrific white mixture on it.

Also yes I‚Äôm aware I have parked on the pavement; as mentioned in earlier posts, the council has allowed it on my road + this was only temporarily for photos and for SevernTrent to fuck about with some water pipe in front of my drive.

I have it on my rear screen too but they're impossible to get replacements of and I'm worried it'll become smashed once they remove it. 

You can gently push the lip of the rubber over with a wooden or plastic spudger to peek behind it but looking at how far the rust has crept especially in the last picture it will almost certainly need welding. I'm surprised it doesn't leak tbh, if you can take the interior trim panel out you could check.

So it will be fairly pricey to repair but if you like the car and it's otherwise in good condition then it's fixable.

1ocfdxc,Youtuber car raffles,"I'm just asking this for fun, don't hate on me!

  
Let's say you entered a raffle for a Youtuber car.  Let's say that Jag TDC are offering.  Let's say said Jag blows up less than 7 days/30 days/6 months from the date you paid money.  Could you return it to them and demand they fix it or refund you?

  
Firstly the company running the raffle may not be the company that owns the Youtube channel so liability is with them I assume as they took the money.  But this is also a business transaction, not a private sale.  You paid money to a business and you received a car in return.

  
Could you claim distance selling regulations apply?  You didn't get to inspect or test drive the car before you got it.

It's often said a fault that was not disclosed but shows up within a certain time could be reasonably assumed to have existed at the time of the sale.  If the car blows up and the raffle company refuse to fix it could they just refund the cost of the winning raffle ticket (say 20p)?

Or could you insist on the amount you actually paid - say 200 pounds worth of raffle tickets?

And if you paid with credit card, could you do a chargeback - arguing you paid 200 pounds on the understanding you may receive a working car, but actually you received one with an undisclosed fault?

If yes, then could everyone else that entered the raffle also do a chargeback - because they also entered on the assumption the car was working with no undisclosed faults?

Remember, raffle company terms & conditions cannot trump UK law and statutory rights!  Just like a dealer can't claim a sale is 'as is' because they wrote it on the sales contract.

1ocd7sy,Dealership refusing to fix car,"Hi all, I'm hoping someone can help with some advice.

I bought my car in September and after nearly two weeks had it put through a health check by a local specialist who diagnosed it with an exhaust leak. Notably, the catalytic converter and DPF coupling had been cut open and rewelded poorly.

These operations were conducted because the dealership noticed a small noise in the exhaust system, and their recommended garage did the above to remove a stone.

After much avoidance I got their attention by reminding them of my legal rights and now they have suggested they can offer a refund (minus mileage).

My only bugbear is that I drove 150miles for it, and honestly I'd like to keep the car, but with a replacement of the parts. I fear the dealership will reweld both locations and the next buyer will soon enough experience the issue. I know this wouldn't be my problem, but I feel it shouldn't happen.

Would you say an exhaust specialist would've done a better job? Would they have recommended cutting it open, or was there a way to dislodge a stone or debris without this invasive bodge? And I absolutely assume it can't be rewelded.. twice? And, can you push for a satisfactory repair instead of a refund, or does the seller have the legal right to choose.

Are there grounds for the garage to be held to account? I assume the dealership are protective of them, hence the avoidance to replace the parts.

The car was MOT'd prior to the issue, so my argument was that it would likely fail the next MOT. The dealership has offered to retest it, but if it fails they would likely just repatch it surely, adding to the problem. 

I'll be claiming back for the health report of the car against their mileage deduction.

It's likely a communication failure where they'd have perhaps expected an explicit ""I'd like you to quote on doing this work please"" and then a labour/diagnosis charge if you didn't go ahead with the work there.

1ocaqtr,Car smells of petrol,"Hi all

I recently bought a car (Mini Cooper S) which smelled fine during the test drive. However, after the dealer filled it up and sent me on my way, there was a strong smell of petrol in the car. The smell goes away when the air con is on and (obviously) when the windows are open.

What could this be? I‚Äôm hoping that it was purely something like the dealer had stepped in petrol and carried it into the car when filling up - especially since there was no smell during the test drive - but could it be anything else?

The dealer has also offered to pay for an MOT and ‚Äúany costs from the MOT‚Äù, as it hadn‚Äôt met their standards of all sold cars having at least 6 months left on the MOT. Therefore, I‚Äôve got an MOT booked for next week. Should I just take it to the MOT, and if there are any issues, get them to fix it and bill the dealer?

In my mind the fn2 leans more to the fun side, whereas the swift more to the daily.

Main negatives im thinking of around the FN2 are the ride (the roads are remarkably poor around here), the mpg (tho i wont need to use every day to commute) and that constant battle againsy rust through the winter. 

Thoughts on the swift are that it seems like less car for the money on paper at least, but trade off in lower insurance and running costs Should generally be better all round as a daily car with a little less space.

It's not a small job to drop the gearbox, clutch and flywheel off and refit them afterwards, and is a few hours of labour because they're also factoring in putting the car back together afterwards too so she can drive away regardless of whether she chooses to have repairs done.

It's further complicated if it's an AWD version of the Tucson, because then you also have to drop and refit the propshaft too.

If the car is leaking from the rear main seal, then depending on how bad it is the paperwork is right - the clutch could also be contaminated, which will lead to it starting to slip, and can cause clutch disc breakdown where it starts to come apart because of exposure to the oil. If the clutch is contaminated you'll eventually be able to smell it burning when the car's been driven for a while and it'll start to slip. By that point, it's usually past the point of no return.

Generally, if you catch a rear main seal leak early on, you can drop the gearbox off, replace the seal, clean the clutch up, refit it and there's no huge additional cost. If you leave your clutch soaking in oil because you choose not to fix it, then best case scenario you'll need a new clutch disc because the friction material will be fucked. Worst case scenario you'll do flywheel damage from clutch slip, or if the friction material on the disc breaks down, comes off, and you start going metal on metal, you'll kill both the flywheel and maybe the pressure plate too.

If the rear main seal is leaking, which it probably is if the oil is coming out of the bell housing, then that ¬£750 is the cheap option because that's most of the cost of stripdown and re-assembly. Once it's all apart it's a ten minute job to replace the seal, and maybe a half hour to give the clutch a bath and clean it up if it's not too damaged.

Ignoring it like you've suggested and just ""checking her oil"" is the expensive option long term.

However the gearbox, clutch and flywheel would need to be removed to confirm, which is what that labour is for. Once you're at that point, the additional parts and labour to replace the leaking rear main seal would probably be fairly trivial - Another hundred or two at most.¬†


The big question mark is the clutch - as the quote suggests, it needs to be checked for oil contamination from the leaking rear main seal, and if it is found to be contaminated it should be replaced regardless of whether it's currently working fine. If that needs replacing at dealer prices it could add a fairly substantial amount to the repair bill.¬†


Edit: upon request they should be able to provide a full quote for a) just replacing the rear main seal, and b) replacing the rear main AND clutch. At least this way you'll have an idea of what the full cost is prior to accepting or deciding to go elsewhere.¬†"

1oc0v0q,G20 or F30??,"Hi I‚Äôm looking for finance a BMW 3 series, either the 320i or 320d, however I‚Äôm stuck on which model I prefer. I‚Äôm looking to buy a newer car so preferably 2018 plate, or higher, with sub 35k miles. Are there any pros or cons for each model I should be aware of. Thanks

If I was in a limited budget and looking at 2013/4 models then I‚Äôd accept an F series but if you can comfortably get a G then it‚Äôs going to feel nicer for much longer.
As for diesel vs petrol, I‚Äôd have a serious look at your usage and see if a diesel is right for you, for many people a modern diesel just isn‚Äôt the way to go.

TackyAuto (Score: 4): F30 looks nicer IMO but yeah the G series is the way to go if I was buying and could afford it. If I was sensible, I probably wouldn‚Äôt pick either lol

tomj1991 (Score: 2): Going against the grain here and saying id go with the F gen, its the greatest generation of cars BMW has done (in my opinion), the interior is easy, and usable, iDrive 7 is the best version before it goes apeshit with all the different menus and I think the 3 series F is a much better looking car."

Vehicleinfo (Score: 2): You honestly wouldn't be able to gain any noticeable performance so investing in that route is foolish, sound wise it's fairly simple. look at swapping the exhaust for something free flowing( don't cheap out get something that's proven) that will give you a sportier sound and make it feel more responsive next look at changing the air filter for something less restrictive stick with the original air box as it's designed for optimal airflow better flowing panel filters are widely available. The mistake most make is they think a cone or pod filter gives you noise and looks great but really they usually make no difference or reduce power.

Avionykx (Score: 1): They drive like a go-cart anyway. You're not going to get much more fun out of a modern car with that kind of power than a Clio. They are great. 

If you REALLY want to see what a Clio 0.9 can do? Go to France and drive the Calais-Paris roads. 

I've been cruising at ""motorway speeds"" in a 400HP V8 and had a little battered to heck Clio in my rear view flashing it's lights ready to fly past at speeds previously unrecorded in F1 testing. There's normally some impeccably dressed young lady driving with a cigarette in one hand and doing her lipstick with the other.

I'm utterly convinced that Renault map their cars so they give far more power in France than anywhere else."
