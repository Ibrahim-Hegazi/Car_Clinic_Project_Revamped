1nrgvv8,Oxygen sensor permanent code.,"Hi All, quick question,

My check engine light was on and when I took it into the shop, they said the O2 sensor was bad. It was replaced, but the check engine light was still on when they gave the car back to me. I let them know and the owner brought out the machine to check the code and it came up with a permanent code for the O2 sensor. They replaced the O2 sensor again, thinking it was just faulty, but the check engine light was still on. Since I’ve gotten home, I did a lot of research and it’s a permanent codes. Take many drive cycles to clear and the car needs to do it on its own? Is this correct? Right now I have an appointment in a few days for them to look at the computer in the car, but I’m wondering if they were just mistaken in the code, my clear on its own since the sensor has been replaced twice. Thank you for your advice. I really appreciate the help!

I can tell you what more info is relevant but I don't wanna be the guy who says ""cat is problem"". In truth ...given all your info *I* still could not diagnose on reddit (irl I still be guessing on my own cars...I quit the repair biz in 1985).

Give your car model,engine + #cylinders ... we'll assume it's got original cat(s). Does exhaust smell bad?

And what code or codes? 

P0130 P0132 P0134 P0135. circuit issues

P0420 : catalyst efficiency below threshold..Bank 1
   (1 = side of engine with cyl#1.

P0430 : same as above for Bank 2

How is efficiency determined? Seems to need an O2 sensor BEFORE the cat and a sensor AFTER the cat (downstream). The confusing part: If the downstream sensor's readings change TOO MUCH, it indicates the catalytic CONVERTER isn't cleaning the exhaust effectively. This baffles me. 

But replacing a cat may be the LAST thing to try!
Gotta rule out:

bad O2 sensors
Exhaust leaks
Unburnt fuel clogging cat...
Engine misfires, ignition/spark...injector(s)!

Using a scan tool with LIVE DATA.. observe upstream and downstream sensors. A healthy cat will show downstream sensor with slow steady voltage swings.

I've never gotten to this last above step.

Tangent? I have a 1989 Toyota truck (190k miles and I got it almost new at 40k).  This is before OBDII, just a check engine light and OBDI(1). Never touched fuel injectors, ran steady always. Exhaust front pipe replaced at 100k but kept original cat. Exhaust STUNK some mornings but I lived with it since it ran well. Ignored the occasional Check Engine dash light..it would eventually clear, never learned how to tame it. Finally the cat rotted (just flange area, broke off) this year/2025. I replaced cat with a straight open pipe (now Antique registered in a state allowing no-inspection antiques). I don't think it even has a downstream sensor...so of course the Check Engine persists after cat delete. Oh and.... With old cat out I could peek thru the honeycomb inside converter...expected to see crud, anything... But mine looked Really Clean, based on light passing thru perfectly on every tiny ""hole""(=passage front to back, a foot long honeycomb of passages). So .that rotten egg smell could NOT mean my cat was all nasty inside, if my eye said it looks clean? What am I not understanding.

Weird science ain't it! And who can you trust to debug.

We're really nervous and hoping the van we just bought only needs a transmission fluid change... But I don't have enough experience to know if this is an alarming color.

It shifts weird in 3rd gear, and it didn't turn on once, but I think that's because my husband had walked into his work building with the other key fob, and the main one (the one I have) might be having a dying battery in it? It started right up with no problems when I tried a second time. Just scared me lol.

1nrgdly,2008 Mini Cooper R56/57 – High-pitched sound at idle (video attached),"Hey everyone,

Starting a couple of days ago I noticed a high-pitched sound coming from the engine area. 

What’s interesting is:
	•	It only happens when the engine is running and I’m stopped (e.g., at a red light).
	•	As soon as I start driving, the sound goes away.
	•	Even the lightest touch of the gas pedal makes it disappear.
	•	I tested it with the top down, so I’m pretty confident about the sound going away while starting to drive - and just masked by the engine sound 
	•	No engine lights are on, and the car is running/behaving normally otherwise.

A couple of things I thought it might be:
	•	Valve cover (was replaced a few months ago, and it’s been fine since).
	•	Transmission?
	•	One of the belts?

I’ll attach a short video of the sound for reference.

Any ideas on where I should start looking?

1nrfcrr,Still leaking after multiple trips to shop -- Is the mechanic at fault?,"Hoping to get some advice on how to proceed with my 2017 Tiguan (108k miles) and the shop thats been struggling to fix it. This car has been a perfectly fine until the last \~20k miles, but suddenly seems like everything is falling apart -- stemming from one visit to a local mechanic (a VW 'specialist') in Portland Maine, where I live.

To start, Last year I brought it into this indy VW shop at around 100k miles for new brakes and the shop told me the car desperately needed the timing chain redone. I agreed and was charged 4700 for new brakes, timing chain, new battery, and a minor fix on the AC fan not blowing any faster than the lowest setting. Going into that repair I knew it also needed new ti res so about a week after the repair we went into a ti re shop and as soon as they put the car up on the jack they called me and said oil was all over everything -- there was clearly an issue with the engine leaking oil.

I brought it back in to the VW shop and they couldn't immediately determine where the oil had come from, but after driving it for a while they called and told me that they discovered oil was spewing from where the dipstick tube goes through the timing chain cover. Presumably a bad gasket fit or bad reassembly specifically on that oil dipstick tube. So for free they redid that, and kinda cleaned up the engine. I say kinda because there was still some oily mess in the general area.

Now 12 months later, there hadn't been any issues until about a month ago. While we were driving down the highway the battery icon on the dash came on (red) about 15 minutes into the drive. Then about 5 minutes later the alternator pulley/belt shredded to pieces seemingly spontaneously. Causing about 10 other dash lights to come on and power steering to stop working... I figured when the battery light on the dash came on it was another bad battery but it obviously was related to the belt going.

I brought it back into that original shop for them to address this. I was not sure if this was a normal failure of a belt, or if this was caused by the previous issues, or oily mess, but I had the car towed from where it fell apart to the shop and just waited to hear from them. 

Side note: they are notoriously bad at communicating. They rarely answer the phone, and only call back when your cars done, and often close early without warning which had made picking up the car on an earlier visit a pain... 

So since I dropped it off out-of-the-blue I figured I'd just hear from them when they finally had time. About a week later I heard from one person that they had started looking at it and were worried that some of the belt bits had been sucked up into the crank case (I believe thats what they said) and they were worried the belt bits might have done internal damage.

Another week goes by while i'm waiting to hear anything and finally the owner calls and tells me the cars been complete for a couple days, they 'warrantied' as much as they could from the original repair, but it was basically wholly unrelated and the new cost was 1700 for this work. They didn't explain the work before hand, they simply did the work and then called after. I was told the car was totally fine  now and all is good. Sometimes that just happens. I wasn't really comfortable with that but it is what it is.

Now 2 weeks later, I've noticed the car is leaving puddles of oil on the ground everywhere I go. I drove 10 minutes to the store and back and when i got out I looked at the underside and oil was dripping roughly 1 drop every \~10 seconds, creating a sizable puddle every time I drive and park the car.

How should I proceed with this mechanic. It seems like it should be their responsibility to fix this leak, for free, right? Also, i'm started to feel like maybe this belt/pulley issue wasn't a fluke and maybe from their original work being shotty -- is that possible? Can i trust them to fix this? what if they refuse to do it for free? Should i just cut my losses and try to start new at a different shop?",1,1758926914.0,3,MechanicAdvice,1759001490,2025-09-26 22:48:34,2025-09-27 19:31:30,"Grand_Possibility_69 (Score: 1): This really needs a tldr.

So first it did get a new timing chain. And then there was an oil leak after that. Unfortunate but not uncommon. And they fixed it for free as they should.

And then it was fine for a year until something failed and belt jumped off. And then even later it leaks oil but there's no information on where.

First and second parts seem unrelated. A VAG car passed 160tkm or 100k miles is normal to have problems like this.

So only problems here seem to be that they didn't communicate things to you and you can't really tell things to us. Or maybe you did but I just missed that from this long post.

Anyway, since then (but probably before), I’ve noticed my car hesitating to switch gears, riding higher than normal, switching gears but the gauge falls quickly and dramatically, the tachometer gauge rushing up without my acceleration matching, etc. In the past, I would notice that if I tried to step on it (like to accelerate quickly onto the freeway), that my car wasn’t very reactive to that. But I assumed it was just a quirk of the car. Now I’m not so sure. Anyway, alongside those weird symptoms just from watching my tachometer, when I accelerate it feels like I’m struggling to drive up a steep hill even if I’m on a flat road.

If its a DCT transmission, then it's almost certainly the DCT transmission giving problems. Ford has lost many millions on it.

First bet is to clean up all the electrical system. Clean the grounds and connections everywhere. Test the battery for free at a local auto parts test. Clean the battery terminals. Have the alternator tested for free.

One known issue is that the electrical ground strap for this transmission had a painted bolt holding it down. That's a problem because the paint would stop the electrical signal from working. Fix is to replace the bolt with an unpainted one so it can actually give a strong signal.

If it doesn't work well still, do some really hard accelerations. 0-60 flooring it. Sometimes the Dry Clutches will have fluids spill onto them, and this causes them to slip instead of clutch on. Driving like a grandma will cause these various fluids and contaminants to accumulate, so putting it under more stress can burn-away these contaminants.

Otherwise, it's probably lot of money to resolve. You could also try getting it calibrated I think, but now I'm the territory of speculation."

I noticed that whenever the code appears, my MAF sensor reads around 12g/s, instead of the usual 6g/s.

I recently heard some noise sloshing around from the passenger side dash while turning. After getting out of my car, I was able to pull up the carpet a little bit and mess with the plastic drainage tube (same white one you see in the video). TONS of water did eventually come out from the bottom of my car which even made a small puddle. 

Now, I looked a bit deeper and de-attached the plastic which covers the wires up. I noticed that one of cables (shown in the video) also had some water being exposed to it (MORE BELOW)",1,1758917209.0,5,MechanicAdvice,1759001490,2025-09-26 20:06:49,2025-09-27 19:31:30,"Icyrandomacc (Score: 1): you can even see bits of what might be rust or corrosion. This exact thing happened to me 2 months or so ago, however, the water was way worse to where my entire passenger side floor was pretty wet, and my entire car stopped working. I was unable to crank or even it to start, and had to wait a good week until it dried and started working again. I assume this was due to the wires being in contact with water for that period of time. I chalked it up to just a clog in the drainage originally. But fast forward and now it seemed to have built up once again. 

I can attach a video below, and if you have any idea on what it could be coming from or what I can do, I’d appreciate it a ton! :)

The tube got blocked by dirt/algae/whatever, and water built up. Maybe it built up so much that some got to that component(probably a fan resistor/controller) in your video, during a turn or bump. If its still working, be happy!

Past-Attorney-8197 (Score: 3): I suggest calling a local mechanic and seeing if they can perform a leakdown test on your vehicle. It almost sounds like you have a bad head gasket - coolant loss without obvious leaking is not a great sign. It has to go somewhere, which sometimes can mean into the engine. A bad head gasket can allow coolant to flow into the combustion cylinders, where it gets burned up. Its possible during the some of these times your vehicle was overheated, it caused further damage.



The way to rule this out is with a leakdown test, which is where they apply shop air to each cylinder, and are able to confirm the cylinder is 'sealed' and not leaking from the head gasket.

It fits a brand new oil filter perfectly, and I can wrench the oil filter on no problem.  However, after 10k miles, I do my oil change, and I cannot get the wrench onto the old filter.  It just wont fit anymore.  I tried a slightly larger oil filter wrench with less flutes, and although it fits, it just can't grab the oil filter to break it.  I end up taking it to a shop nearby, and they're able to get the filter off with some difficulty.  It's almost like the filter becomes seized onto the bolting plate.

What do you folks think is happening?  Does the oil filter expand over time with heat and pressure?  It makes sense.  But, I've never had this happen with my other cars.  This is a Rav4 Prime PHEV.  I would say half of the 10k miles are on EV, so there shouldn't be a lot of wear and tear on the filter.

By comparison old Third and Fourth Wave engines run at around 70kPa at idle and only have a big pressure spike at around 3000rpm.

If not, then…

1) it theoretically could be CV grease, but seeping would be a matter of the lifespan shortening by a fairly small percentage… like 70k miles instead of 100k. Not urgent, and if it goes bad it goes bad, happens all the time, not a big deal and not terribly expensive. 

2) It could be drips/residue from a different leak that they weren’t paying attention to, hence “find the hole”. 

Inner joints like that tend to last longer than outer joints (because they don’t have to flex as much) but that also means they’re not always as easy to recognize when they’re going bad. 

If they couldn’t show me a tear in the rubber boot, I wouldn’t stress over it, but keep it in the back of your mind as a preventative fix later down the road, especially if you can combine it with other work like struts or wheel bearings where they’d be in there anyway.

1nr4j3y,"GMC Acadia was being faulty, dealership replaces wrong part, now what?","A few months ago we had a 2017 GMC Acadia start behaving a little oddly. It would shift a little more roughly than usual, and before we had a chance to even investigate that, we had a very scary moment where we were in the middle of a busy intersection turning left when the entire vehicle just shut down entirely. Power steering, brakes, shifter, and everything was just dead. After 2 minutes of trying to start it up again, it finally came back to life and we were able to continue back home, at which point the next day it was towed to the dealership.

My gut reaction was it was a computer or electrical issue. After all, how does something this systemic happen without it being something like a central computer, right? I looked it up online and it indeed said a common culprit is a fault with the ECM. The dealership sure enough said it was a computer problem. I looked at the SOW, it said they replaced the EBCM and an O2 sensor which was also on the brink, and some $1,500 later, we had our car back.

It still showed signs of it shifting oddly, but it was very random and intermittent. We told a non-dealer mechanic about it while they were fixing something else (this time the shutter mechanism) but they said they couldn't reproduce the problem when they were test driving it, but they said if the ECM was recently replaced, then it could just be that it needs to sort of ""retrain"" itself to know what the idle state is, how the throttle input works, and it may improve itself over time, and they gave me some tips on how to really prompt a ""reset"" of sorts by leaving it idle for a bit, followed by some highway driving for a few miles, all that.

So over the course of the next few months, it just continued on doing its weird shifting every once in a while, but it was definitely getting *worse* and not better over those months. It started getting much more frequent, so now I took it to that mechanic again. It was then they were able to reproduce and took a deeper look at it, and then they noticed something very odd. The ECM that was said to have been replaced looks like it had been in there for years, having collected years of grime and what not. I showed them the work-order from when they did it, and they realized, ""Oh, now it makes sense, they didn't replace the ECM at all, but the EBCM. That's basically the ABS computer.""

This mechanic concluded that it had to be a mistake. The symptoms I had back then where the car shut off dead in an intersection and showed some odd shifting could not have been caused by an *ABS* issue, and perhaps the tech made a dumb mistake adding a ""B"" to the order and what not.

So I call the dealership, and they looked up the work. They double-downed saying when they scanned the system, an error code came up on the EBCM, and that's it. So that was what was faulty. I objected saying I don't understand how an ABS or EBCM issue could cause the problem we had. And furthermore, it didn't even fix the problem in the first place. They just shrugged it off, and said we could bring it back in, but they're backlogged for 3 weeks.

I just wanted others' opinions here. Is it possible the dealership were reasonable in this? Should they have seen that code and figured it was something to fix for sure but couldn't be directly related to the symptoms? Maybe the faulty O2 sensor was a more reasonable case for a root-cause?

1nr4hv1,2010 Subaru Outback 2.5L - P0301 Misfire at Idle after Plugs & Coils Replaced,"I'm looking for some guidance on a persistent misfire issue with my Outback. I've done the basics but I'm stuck on the next logical step.

Vehicle:

2010 Subaru Outback
2.5L 4-Cylinder Engine
~202,000 miles

The Problem:
Code: P0301 (Misfire on Cylinder 1)

Symptom: A noticeable stumble/misfire, primarily at idle. The Check Engine Light is on and steady.

What I've Done So Far:
A couple of months ago, I had a catalytic converter code. To address it, I replaced the downstream O2 sensor and all four spark plugs (brand unknown). This cleared the cat code.

To fix the current P0301 misfire, I have just replaced the ignition coils, but there was no change in the idle stumble.

Important History / Clues:

After the cleaning the code for O2 sensor/spark plug change but before we changed anything, a few months back, I had an issue where the engine would stall when letting off the gas.

My main question is, what's next? Since I've already addressed the most common ignition items (plugs and coils), I'm leaning toward a more serious issue.

VCDS is old VAG-COM right? Developed by Ross-Tech. Google tells that what VAG dealership uses is something called ODIS? I've never heard of it so is this correct, and is it actually something they sell, or only licensed to dealerships?

What about those chinese close using something called FTDchip? What's that and what does that have to do with the interface. Sometimes it's said driver is required, but wouldn't that come with the software anyway?

And the most basic question imaginable for last: K-Line is that old protocol that Audis with 2x2 connector use, right? And newer Audis have OBD II. What is OBD I?

I'm a college student w/ little car experience, but I sure can turn a wrench.

Yesterday, while idling, I heard some bubbling before discovering that my plastic coolant reservoir cap had shot off. I was hoping that air somehow got in the line and caused that to happen, so I replaced the coolant cap, radiator cap, and added more of the same brand coolant that I've been using.

After starting the car and driving slow around the parking lot, it seemed to be fine, but after idling for a bit the coolant began bubbling and I shut the engine off. Haven't touched it since.

My initial research led me to believe that all I had was a failed thermostat. However, after looking under the radiator cap, I'm worried I may be dealing with a blown head gasket.

I simply cannot afford to pay a mechanic or buy another car, so here's where I'm at:

Today I'm going to replace the thermostat and flush the coolant, but I'm not going to run the engine until I hear back from this subreddit, because I don't want to overheat it anymore than it already might have been.

Am I good to replace the thermostat and run the engine, keeping an eye on the temp gauge

or

Do I need to do a week or two of research & reading manuals so that I can replace the head gasket - and the water pump & timing belt while im there.

or

Do I scrap the car and get to walking to work?

I included an image of my coolant under the radiator cap and the coolant on a paper towel next to the oil on a paper towel in hopes that maybe my coolant is just needing a flush & not mixing with oil. (Oil on right, coolant on left)

I thought because the smoke stopped so fast It maybe wasnt me- I sat on the edge of the freeway for like 10 minutes before hopping back in to just get off the freeway and to the nearest parking lot.

I think that is where I f.... my car off for sure.. I make it off the freeway, stop to turn right on the top of the hill/exit and as I start to turn, my car shuts off.

When I was gifted the car, I was told it probably wouldnt run for a long time, just use it to get confident in driving, and that I should DEFINITELY not put money into it, getting it repaired, or fixed once It does break down.

I've done 12000 miles, and the bulk of these has been on long motorways so it hadn't all been done stop starting in a city. I've also been driving close to a decade and have had other cars that I've driven way more miles while I've had them with no clutch issues whatsoever, surely to break a clutch in 12000 miles you'd have to be driving it horrifically.

Any ideas? Thank you in advance.

What you did was create a small gap between your rim and rotor. That gap is the source of your vibration. Lift up your car, snug the nuts up by hand as tight as you can, then put it down and torque them.

1nqszsr,Funny story from 2002,"I was just recalling something I experienced in 2002, and thought I would share it here for the sake of humor. 

I was shopping for a new car.  I decided to go to the local [Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_Corporation) dealer and look at their offerings.  A salesman came out to greet me on the lot.  He looked to be about 19 years old. 

I popped the hood on a model in which I was interested and examined the 4-cylinder engine.  I knew that Saturn did not make their own engines, and I asked the salesman, ""Who made this engine?"".  I could immediately see absolute panic on his face.   His eyes darted around, and I saw him focus on something in the engine compartment.  Then he blurted out, ""**Catalytic.  Catalytic made the engine.**""  \[**NOTE**: his eyes had fixated on an EPA-required decal in the engine compartment stating that the car was equipped with a Catalytic converter.\]

I just looked at him. Neither one of us said a word for about twenty seconds.  Then, I broke the silence by asking, ""Are you sure that's the story that you want to stick with?"".  He immediately replied, ""I'll go ask my boss"".  He then scampered inside.

About a minute later, the Sales Manager came running out with the kid in tow.  The Sales Manager said, ""That engine was made by GM's [Opel division ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opel)in Germany"".  I considered that to be a favorable answer.  At the time, Opel meant to me both innovation and German quality.  But I just could not get past a dealership that would put a kid out on his own telling customers that the engine was made by ""Catalytic"".  Maybe the kid was dumb enough to confuse ""Catalytic"" with ""Cadillac""... I never knew, and I never cared.

Oil change places are only occasionally correct when it comes to electrical. Take the vehicle either to the dealer, or a battery specialist shop where you can get a better test.

I'm trying to narrow things down before having to take it to someone to work on.

**The story:** Driving on the highway, slowing and coming to a stop because of traffic and BOOM the engine stalled very suddenly and would NOT turn over, no power steering or power braking, but power to everything else like windows and A/C. 45min to an hour later the car is towed back home and it can magically start; runs like it did before, relatively smooth for an old car.

When it happened the dash lights that came on were the battery light and oil light, but idk if that's just because the key was turned so that only the power was on. I can't say for certain, it all happened so fast, we were scared we were gonna wreck.

The only engine light code has to do with a small emissions leak (EVAP), fixable, not worried about it.

Alternator is doing a perfect job, no slipped belt, 13V to battery. A buddy checked the battery and said it was low on acid and below spec cold cranking amps. Oil had been topped off a couple months ago and is still fine. No liquids dripping onto the ground. No misfires.

These theories are based off of what others have told me, I'm not knowledgeable in cars, I'm just a scrub.

**Theory 1:** Vapor lock, don't know how to check for such a thing. It is hot af where I live if it helps. How would such a thing be fixed?

**Theory 2:** Temporary transmission failure of some kind, like a bad seal that caused the car to stall at low rpm (remember, we were slowing down). Apparently early 2000s Lexus have notorious transmissions. Digging around the internet I have similar occasional harsh shifting and slight stuttering like others had reported, but nothing horrible nor often in my case.

**Theory 3:** Temporary fuel pump failure, bad wiring or bad relay causing fuel to not flow correctly.

**Theory 4:** some other electrical thing idk man.

Does anyone have experience with such a strange scenario? I have not been able to repeat the experience (partly because I'm scared to do it on the road).

1nr5oiu,manual transmission or clutch help. something,I have a 2011 Mazda three manual 2.5 L and it seems like my clutch is getting softer I believe? Its RPM gauge goes up higher than it needs to when accelerating can’t really keep speed and I just wanna know what the problem likely is.

I just replaced the oil pan gasket on my 96 BMW E36 328is and forgot any sort of gasket material on the parts where the block meets the timing chain cover. When I took off the original oil pan gasket I saw no signs of any rtv or gasket maker on those joints. Was wondering if I should drop the pan again just to apply some on those joints or not?
It’s not a cork gasket it is one that has rubber and metal.

The thermostats were easy to replace, as was the radiator. The car is still overheating. There WAS an issue with the radiator, it had a leak, so I tried K-Seal. The leak was too big, couldn't be fixed, so I replaced the radiator.

I read that this particular model can have issues with air trapped in the radiator. I bought the burping funnel off Amazon and I believe all the air is out of the system.

Other than that, my car hasn't been experiencing any other issues. Dodge told me that when they went to test the wiring harness, it wasn't getting the correct voltage to the tuning valve and upon further inspection, found that my pcm was failing internally, and since my car is so old, they dont have the part at all, and can't do a reflash.

Could be anything - corrosion in the pcm, busted solder connection, failed resistor or capacitor. And when that one thing fails, the entire unit has failed because they're almost always non repairable. 

The intake tuning valve is important because it adjusted your air fuel ratios and it can cause issues with things from fuel mileage to causing the car to run too lean and create issues internally.

You need to call around to some other shops to see if they'll work with it. If you can't get a brand new one, which at 15 years old isn't uncommon, you'll need to get a used one from ebay or a junk yard, and find someone who can flash it for you. Usually they're tied to the VIN of the car, which is why they need to be reflashed. There are also places that you can send it to in order to flash it, I'm sure a lot of shops don't necessarily have the tool.

Be aware that getting a used one means you may get another one that doesn't work. I'd estimate a couple few hundred bucks for the programming, and usually they're pretty easy to remove and install. That just means if it doesn't work, you'll be on the line for the labor and programming again, if you decide to buy it yourself. And you won't get a warranty on a used one.

The dealership just doesn't want to deal with old cars - I recommend finding a mechanic that isn't tied to Dodge themselves."

This was my first car, second hand bought, over 250000+ miles for around 3k$ in Cali
I dont have a license (starting off strong I know) 
So I dont necessarily have ""real"" insurance for it. 

What happened yesterday: 
Before leaving where I was to make a 35 min commute home, traffic hour, I added more oil (w-5//30? something like that) to where I always had, my ac doesnt work so I know that wasn't it. I get onto the freeway things are still going okay, but when I hit the traffic, and my car is slowly moving I notice the CRAZY amount of smoke coming from behind me, so I start tweaking- I know it's me- I pull over and turn the car off and hop out. 
Call #1, tell me to tell the person who got the car for me
I did not do that...

I thought because the smoke stopped so fast It maybe wasnt me- I sat on the edge of the freeway for like 10 minutes before hopping back in to just get off the freeway and to the nearest parking lot. 

I think that is where I fucked my car off for sure..
I make it off the freeway, stop to turn right on the top of the hill/exit and as I start to turn, my car shuts off. It's just rolling down now before it all flashed back on again likke I had just restarted the car. But I make it- still hella smoking to a lot. Freaking out. 

I have been running my own fate, ignoring the check engine light when it flashes (inconsistently) as well as the ""change oil soon"" because I had been told by autozone employees they thought it was js a normal little leak.  When I was gifted the car, I was told it probably wouldnt run for a long time, just use it to get confident in driving, and that I should DEFINITELY not put money into it, getting it repaired, or fixed once It does break down. 

With that being saiid, I called AAA, they come get my car- we pull up the repair shop is closed but the tow guy said he thinks it was something with mixing oils from a head gasket or something... which I have been informed is not very good at all...


I will be informing the person I got in the car today later before I head to work, but I thought it would be better to ask y'all if you thought there would be any better options or any ideas how....it may.....to repair or how I should start getting to ..... parts or the car as a whole, like I said, I've never been in a situation like this before and the person that brought me the car will not be much help so any info is appreciated

Now all the air is out of the system top it up to the max line and put the cover on.

If you don't see coolant on the ground don't mean it's not leaking,, some radiators have a transmission cooler built on the side sometimes the coolant will leak into the transmission.

I'm trying to narrow things down before having to take it to someone to work on.

**The story:** Driving on the highway, slowing and coming to a stop because of traffic and BOOM the engine stalled very suddenly and would NOT turn over, no power steering or power braking, but power to everything else like windows and A/C. 45min to an hour later the car is towed back home and it can magically start; runs like it did before, relatively smooth for an old car.

When it happened the dash lights that came on were the battery light and oil light, but idk if that's just because the key was turned so that only the power was on. I can't say for certain, it all happened so fast, we were scared we were gonna wreck.

The only engine light code has to do with a small emissions leak (EVAP), fixable, not worried about it.

Alternator is doing a perfect job, no slipped belt, 13V to battery. A buddy checked the battery and said it was low on acid and below spec cold cranking amps. Oil had been topped off a couple months ago and is still fine. No liquids dripping onto the ground. No misfires.

These theories are based off of what others have told me, I'm not knowledgeable in cars, I'm just a scrub.

**Theory 1:** Vapor lock, don't know how to check for such a thing. It is hot af where I live if it helps. How would such a thing be fixed?

**Theory 2:** Temporary transmission failure of some kind, like a bad seal that caused the car to stall at low rpm (remember, we were slowing down). Apparently early 2000s Lexus have notorious transmissions. Digging around the internet I have similar occasional harsh shifting and slight stuttering like others had reported, but nothing horrible nor often in my case.

**Theory 3:** Temporary fuel pump failure, bad wiring or bad relay causing fuel to not flow correctly.

**Theory 4:** some other electrical thing idk man.

Does anyone have experience with such a strange scenario? I have not been able to repeat the experience (partly because I'm scared to do it on the road).

I had a strange occurance today. During driving suddenly all the power went dark. No lights, no dash, no radio..all. After some seconds it came back. This happened 3 times. So i thought maybe a loose connection. When i looked at my battery i noticed that the plastic fuse housing was melting, since the cable from the battery to it got extremely hot.
Maybe it has something to do with the heater/fan since i was on the max fan level. After i switched it of the car started again without any issues and power didn't went off.

So now my questions:
1. Could that indeed be a problem of the fan?
2. Is the installed fuse to powerfull that it didn't burn out?
3. Could it be a problem that one small cable goes from the battery to the box and then two cables go out? So basically a bottleneck which results in heat?

1nr5d5u,Would loose wiring cause check engine light to come on?,"Back in either June or July we had a trailer hitch and wiring installed, by U-haul. Obviously, I'm no mechanic, but since then, when you turn the blinker on, sometimes the raido/GPS panel (dash?) will dim, and the interior lights (if on) will flicker. It's not constant, but when that happens, it's a good chance the check engine light will come on. The code reads for a Cat or O2 sensor in the Cat needs replacing, but after a day or 2 the engine light goes out again, and has stayed out for nearly 2 weeks before coming on (most often when the raido display dims when using the blinker) again. Sometimes it goes off again within a few hours.

I am aware this could be 2 separate issues: gunk clogging the sensor in the cat converter that eventually loosens and passes through the chambers of the converter and loose wiring. I ask because my husband (not a mechanic, just DIYer who has helped his dad when younger) believes the wiring is causing the issues with the check engine light rather than us needing a new cat converter.

It's a 2016 Jeep Patriot. There were no issues before the wiring, which is why I'm curious. I know I'll need to have a mechanic check for certain what's going on, and if it is wiring, that's cheaper than having the cat replaced. Is there a way I can check without bringing it to a shop?

Hell to get out and hell to Install because the space was so confined and the lighting terrible even with a torch and in broad daylight. I dropped two or three nuts and in the end found the closest screw that seemed to fit and gave it a go. It did tighten on the one side but I wasn't sure if it was seated properly in the socket, there seemed a little play in it but I could not push it in with my hand any further. 

Botched job? Probably, but it gets worse. The car still wouldn't start but I decided to slow charge the battery as the car had been left standing idle for 12 days. I took a multimeter reading which I think was 12.6 Volts but I can't be sure but I thought it might be too low. 

When I went to replace the battery I was very tired and it was getting dark. Like a complete imbecile I hooked the battery up the wrong way round. There was a slight spark when I connected the negative to the positive terminal but nothing major. When I turned the ignition on there was just like a whimper of a noise not like it was last time just a kind of rattling. The wiper blades came on, as did the front lamps. It was then that I took a closer look and realised what I had done. Straight away I disconnected the battery (observing the correct order) 

The following day I tried to start the car again as I was using an obd reader to try and diagnose any error codes. The engine would not start but it was making what I thought were the right noises. The obd reader connected to the the car but not return any data. After two or three more turns of the ignition I tried it again and but this time only the lights on the dashboard briefly flashed and no response from the engine at all.

1nqzx29,"replaced key shell yesterday, forgot transponder, put it in today but car still won’t start (only hear starter click) — what else can I try?","Hi everyone,  
I’m stuck and would appreciate any advice.

Yesterday I replaced the plastic shell of my Toyota Aygo 2009 key. I forgot to transfer a tiny black piece (I think it’s the transponder chip) into the new shell. Today I noticed the mistake, put that little piece into the new key, and tried to start the car — but it still won’t start.

What I tried so far:

* Tried the **new key** with the transponder inserted.
* Tried the **spare key** I have.
* **Jump-started** the car by connecting the battery to another car (so I don’t think it’s just a dead battery).
* When I try to start I just hear a **click** from the starter, the engine doesn’t turn over.

What I suspect:

* The immobilizer might not be recognizing the key/transponder.
* The transponder might be broken or not seated correctly in the new shell.
* There still could be a battery/current issue or a starter problem, but jump-starting didn’t help.

Anything else I should try before calling a locksmith/dealer?  
Specific things I’d appreciate advice on:

* How to check whether the transponder is actually working / correctly seated inside the key shell.
* Any simple immobilizer reset tricks for a 2009 Aygo (I read about disconnecting the battery briefly — is that safe/useful?).
* If the spare key also doesn’t start the car, does that mean the problem is the car (immobilizer/ECU/starter) rather than the key?
* Should I take it to an electrician/fabbro/dealer first? Which is likely cheaper/faster?

Thanks in advance — any tips, similar experiences or step‑by‑step checks would be super helpful.

1nqodzj,Stripped threads out of front diff case- what now?,"Over the weekend I was giving a Kubota RTV some much needed maintenance, which included draining the old hydraulic oil out of the front diff case and refilling it with fresh fluid. Everything was going reasonably well until I backed the M12 drain plug out and the threads from the diff case came with it. Trying to thread it back in was pointless until I removed the crush washer, which allowed me to grab at least one thread to get it back in and get the machine running again. After getting everything else finished up I noticed there were no leaks and no fluid sweating from the plug, meaning it’s sealed for now. However, I don’t want to just leave it as is because if that one thread decides it doesn’t want to hold anymore then it could be catastrophic if nobody notices and drives it. Keep in mind this is on a farm where “maintenance” doesn’t happen until something explodes most of the time. I am trying to change that and I want to start by doing this(maybe) the right way by balancing cost vs reasonability of repair. 

The way I see it I have 5 options, and I wanted some real mechanics (I am not a real one- I am a somewhat mechanically inclined parts guy) to give me their thoughts before I choose a path 

1. Leave it as is and let er buck. If it’s got a thread and it’s not leaking, then don’t worry about it. 

2. JB weld/silicone the plug back into that hole and drain from the top of the case from now on with a fluid pump. 

3. Buy a 12mm snap in rubber plug from Amazon and stick it in there since it (presumably) isn’t high pressure 

4. Drill what is left of the old threads and tap a new one. I do not want to do this. I have never done this before and a front diff case seems like a bad place to learn via trial and error

5. Take it to the dealer and have them replace the diff case. Tearing the front end out is beyond my skill set. Probably more so than putting it back together.

1nrgtfm,GR86 ownership questions – buying my first car in the UK,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking to buy my first car in the UK and, as a car enthusiast, I’ve got my eye on the Toyota GR86. I work in the automotive industry and have access to a fleet car, so the GR86 would mainly be my “fun” car, with the occasional road trip (I’m especially keen on driving it into Europe).

A few questions I’d love some input on (apologies if they’re basic - I’m new to vehicle ownership here in the UK):

	•	Am I right in thinking the GR86 was only offered as auto/manual, with no trim or spec differences in the UK?
	•	There seem to be only ~27 for sale nationwide, most with under 20k miles. Is that a red flag, or just the reality of how rare they are?
	•	Are there any mechanical differences between the 2022, 2023, and 2024 models? I’d love a 2024, but 2023 examples are more within my budget.
	•	If I’m aiming for a low-mileage car (<10k miles), what service history items should I be checking for, given the car will be relatively new?
	•	I’ve noticed manuals were just under £30k new, yet many used ones are listed above £30k despite being only 1–2 years old. Is this pricing trend likely to continue, and are they fairly easy to resell if I decide to exit?
	•	What are people paying for insurance on these, and are there any quirks or insurers that are better to go with?
	•	For light mods (exhaust, air intake, etc.), can GR/TRD parts be ordered directly through Toyota in the UK, or is there a reliable distributor?
	•	Since the GR86 doesn’t come with rev-matching like the GR Yaris, is there an aftermarket or OEM option to add this, or is it purely down to heel-toe?
	•	Finally, with it being RWD and manual — how manageable are they in winter conditions?

Thanks in advance for any advice!

You'll also market to the customer group you want. If you're Asian and have a place called Sik MoTorZ that exclusively sells wrapped BMWs then you're probably going to put off people who want an appliance kind of car or a well taken care of performance car/classic. 

For me I look at:

* The car and how it's advertised. Is is AI slop, clear lies, lots of ambiguity or hype etc?
* The types and amounts of cars they have for sale. 
* What their reviews are (with a pinch of salt).
* How long they've been in business.
* What their website looks like. Does it have useful information. Company/VAT numbers, a physical address that matches, phone numbers as well as email?
* Do names on the website match companies house details and the names of people you actually speak to?
* Are they responsive on the phone? Do they seem genuine? 

You rarely get everything. But you can sometimes smell a rat. I tend to have a relatively low threshold because I know a little bit about cars and sometimes a shit dealer can have a good car.

I'm also large so not really bothered about turning up to a back street garage in a ropey neighbourhood. But lots of people understandably will be.

I'd look at dealers you want to be like and try to emulate them.

Yes - there's a process called individual vehicle approval which covers home-built vehicles like this, which means you can get log books for custom and small run production vehicles. If it has enough parts from a certain vehicle or year, it would receive an age-related registration number, or it would get a Q plate if it can't be narrowed down sufficiently. After that it's taxed, MOTed and insured, just like any other vehicle.

>Is this always diy? 

More often than not, for this style - the principle is that it's supposed to look like it's cobbled together from scrap, like something from the second mad max movie. There are (or were) specialist builders who could build them however.

>What components are typically used? 

Whatever's cheap and available at the time. Mismatched parts add to the aesthetic here, although the major components would probably all come from the same donor vehicle. u/mrginge94 suggested that this might be a reliant with the body cut off which it probably isn't, but that would be one of the easier ways to get started with a build. From what I remember, you'd probably see more older RWD Ford stuff as well up to the Sierra, and fancier builds might use Jaguar IRS components. Engines can be anything, as long as the overall gearing stays relatively close to original - you don't want it to be revving stupidly at 40mph, or not able to pull off from traffic lights.

>Is there a specific name for this type of trike?

As others have mentioned, it fits into the Rat/Survival group the best. The scene is an offshoot of the more general custom bike scene, so finding out more information probably means a trip to try and find a library that has an archive of Back Street Heroes and AWOL magazines from the 90s and early 2000s when it was at it's height.

1nrdb9j,Parked car got hit today,"I’m sure this question has probably been asked a thousand times before but I’ve searched through and can’t find the answers to my specific questions.

As in the title, my parked car was hit today by a bloke in a transit van. It’s a 2018 Mercedes a200, he’s done quite a bit of damage, the bumper is scratched and dented, headlight smashed, driver door scratched, alloys scratched and somehow a chunk missing from my tyre. It’s not drivable atm. He left his number and a witness has given me his reg. He initially tried to drive off but the witness stopped him and he left me a note with his number. He said he’d rather pay privately for the damages and asked me to get a quote.

I’ve never had anything like this happen before. I spoke to my insurance who said I had two options. 1 would be to claim on my insurance for the repairs. The second would be to have the sister company (enterprise rent a car?) do the repairs, provide me with a courtesy car and then they would try to claim on his insurance for the cost of repairs. I told them I would rather the latter. They said they’ll be in touch on Monday. 

This is all very confusing for me, I thought his insurance would pay out regardless?
What do I do? Contact his insurance company? 
Should I cancel my claim and allow him to pay privately? Will this push my premium up even though I was not at fault? My insurance is already over a grand a year so I’m really not happy about all of this. 

Apologies if these are stupid questions, I don’t really know what to do and I don’t want this situation to end up any worse.

And there are numerous reports of people getting car fixed and 3rd party refusing to foot the bill. Your mention of them trying to drive off doesn't speak much of their character.


Check whether 'sister company' is operating as one of those credit hire companies. They charge ridiculously inflated car hire costs which, if the 3rd party insurer rejects, gets passed onto you (assuming 3rd party is actually insured in the first place). Check the terms and conditions _very_ carefully!


You could follow other commenter's suggestion of going straight to 3rd party insurer, but their motivation is minimizing their costs. Your own insurer may well fix your car to a better standard, although this could increase the chance of it being deemed an uneconomical repair.

If it's LV they upgrade your courtesy car and give you money as well as letting you choose garage it's repaired in. 

Your insurer basically rinses them so it's cheaper to go directly. 

You'll still need to tell your insurer about the claim and the value and yes - premium will go up. No claims not affected for non fault though.

gt4rs (Score: 1): I was in a very similar situation earlier this year, also originally wanted to do it privately but they said they couldn't afford it and reported it to insurance anyway, so by that point there was no reason to not claim. In hindsight it was definitely the right choice and with the amount of damage on your car even moreso - the headlight alone will be a decent amount.

To break it down, there's three options:

* Claim on your policy initially, initially this will affect your NCD and you'll pay the excess until the third party's insurer accepts liability. If your policy has a replacement car you'll get one according to those terms (i.e. it'll only be like for like if you had that). This is the first option you listed.
* Your insurer could refer you to an accident management company in cases where it's clear cut that it's not your fault. I was told that if your car was parked then it's usually quite easy. The company takes on the costs and then recovers them from the third party insurer without really involving your insurer so you don't pay your excess, but the risk here is that they often like to rack up unnecessary costs that the third party insurer can dispute (for example they'll give you a like for like hire car but it often ends up being much nicer than your own car). At the same time, a lot of people use this option and have no issues but the risk is worth bearing in mind.
* You claim directly on the third party's insurance. In my case they made it easy by reaching out to me but it seems the other comment suggested you can find out who they are on askMID if they haven't told you already? They'll usually want to keep you happy to stop you choosing the accident management company route, for me they organised a like for like hire car and would've done all the legwork just as if I was claiming through my own insurance. 

I did the last one and had no issues fwiw, I don't think there's a best/worst option really as long as you're aware of the risks of the accident management company"

1nr1dzb,I am not sure why my car insurance is so high for new address.,"I used to live in the town centre in High Wycombe, and as a new driver my car insurance was around £1,500.

Neither my husband or I know anything about cars, unfortunately. After some research we think a Skoda Octavia would be a good fit for our needs, due to size, cost to run and reliability, but there aren't a huge number of petrol automatics available on Autotrader in our budget (up to £6000), and none close enough to us to test drive.

I was wondering, firstly, if distance buying a used car is a bad idea? I spoke to the dealer and he says we can't return it, so it's obviously a bit of a gamble.

Secondly, I don't know anything about different engines, gearboxes, etc, and what to look for or avoid. I'm tempted by this car. The dealer has great reviews (unlike many on Autotrader) and the car looks good to me, but as I said I don't know what red flags to look out for. Does anyone have any advice about whether this would potentially be a good buy or one to avoid? It's been up for three weeks already so no one is in a rush to buy it, clearly!

1nqzie3,"Question regarding jerky/""thud"" sounding tranmission and alternative tranmission fluid for Mazda 6","Hello,

I bought a 2019 Mazda 6 Wagon about a month ago. I absolutely love the car. The car has 91000 miles.

The one issue I am having is the transmission. Especially when the car is cold/beginning of my drive. The gear shifting is can be slightly jerky and sometimes a ""thud"" sound is ever heard. 

This happens about **1%-5%** of the time while I am driving but more noticeable when I am starting my drive. Now I have just done the auto transmission reset from a youtube video but haven't got the chance to drive it yet so I am not sure if this will fix the issue. Also, I've tried the manual shifting mode and such issue doesn't occur.

I understand that Mazda states that their tranmission will last the lifetime of the car but I personally find that odd? I called up my nearest Mazda service centre and they said the same thing as well but they can still change the fluid for me but it will cost me £270 for the fluid and labour which I find it quite expensive. 

Hence, I am wondering if any alternative transmission fluid will work. The **RAVENOL ATF FZ Transmission Fluid** states that they are designed for Mazda auto transmission with quite a number of people saying that their transmission is smoother now when using that fluid. Buying that and bringing to an independent garage will be so much cheaper as well. Unfortunately I do not have my own garage or driveway to do it myself. 

So my question is, is my jerky ish transmission totally normal? If not, should I go ahead with an OEM transmission fluid from Mazda or the above mentioned transmission fluid works as well? Looking to do these first and see if the issue subsides. If not, will have to let a mechanic inspect my transmission. Really appreciate any Mazda owners giving me some advice on this!

Thank you.

£270 from Mazda sounds decent tbh, but I'd still look for an independent shop to do the job. They usually have a machine that pulls the old fluid out as it pumps new fluid in, it's not quite as straight forward as swapping the engine oil. "

Getting an extended warranty is 100% not worth. £1900 for warranty sounds great but that won't cover services or consumable items, which is going to be the bulk of the maintenance on the car, and you'll have an excess for any work that actually is covered, so you're basically gambling on your car having £2500+ worth of repairs needed in the next 3 years.

1nqvipy,The state of distractions and 'improvements' in cars,"A bit of a rant with some questions about the direction VW has gone, not only from what they've taken out but from what they've put in. It seems it's becoming okay for a driver to be distracted by design and thoughtlessness. Am I alone in being disappointed? 

I recently moved from a mk7.5 VW Golf (<3) to a mk8.5 Golf (<\3). Even though VW back peddled a little with returning physical buttons to the steering wheel, there are so many changes about this car that perplex me - elements seem illogical or impractical; a downgrade from prior, or even borderline dangerous in some way. It's not what I've come to expect from VW and it's previous German practically.

Notwithstanding my ire at how much inferior I feel this version is as they've altered many things like:
- front storage gone
- cd player gone
- removed start stop button from near gearstick
- sound insulation much poorer and cab noisier, so music sounds pathetic 
- glovebox now smaller and no longer cooled
- removed ability to see instant fuel consumption
- parcelshelf doesn't seem to fit in under boot floor anymore
- no spare tyre by default
- mandatory keyless; designed place for key is the second front cup holder
- new steel bonnet with new awkward release mechanism, so as it's no longer on hydraulic risers I'm not able to open one handed when filling up washer fluid (I think this was a safety issue though)

But when driving my gripes are how I'm forced to take my eyes off the road by the design or forced technology of the car. From big things like the sometimes downright dangerous 'assistive' technology to really silly things like the stupid cupholder, of which the design makes it hard for me to easily funnel my cup in without first glancing at it. 

When the technology works, it works quite well, but the following doesn't seem to work well, as: 
- Emergency Brake Assist: Used to work fantastically in the 7.5 and only get a bit confused (i.e. Would scream at me) if I went past a bus below 18mph, but it now attempts an emergency stop every time I go to overtake a parked car at up to 25 mph or so. Every. Single. Time.
- Steer Assist: Tries to yank me off the road and into the verge on country lanes or into the car on the other side of the road; essentially gives awful understeer when turning onto a tight lane unless I'm going ridiculously slow OR fights me when merging on roundabouts
- Autodetection of speed limits (I know this can be turned off): Usually very good, but seems to mix up 50 and 30, thinks some places are 20 when they aren't, and wastes fuel by jumping around speed limits.

I know the safety elements are EU law, but seriously is VW alone in how badly these are implemented? How is it right or safe for drivers to be distracted like this?

\- Some insurance also factors in the prices for the courtesy car if they do. 

If I were you, considering the damage on the black one, I would have repaired it by myself; it may not necessarily cost you much. I used to fix and sell cars off copart, and this personally would not have costed me 300-500 at the very max (I was based in N. East) so do shop around before ringing insurance. 

And, if the other party agrees to repair outside of insurance, make sure you get confirmation in writing; you don't want them to change their mind later and claim it under insurance.

1nquxbd,Range Rover Evoque Alternator woes,"2013 Range Rover Evoque 2.2 diesel broke down on me due to dead battery, prior to this happening I had a warning ( 5 minutes before) about generator performance on the dash, fortunately made it almost home by the time it died on me. 

Battery was old so replaced that, tested the voltage when running and only getting 12.4v which should be closer to 13-14 with a good alternator.

Swapped out the alternator with a new unit and retested, 14.8v at the battery when running and generator fault warning now no longer visible on the dash (winning).

Drove it for a day and all good, until the generator performance warning comes back on the dash, checked the voltage at the battery when running and back down to 12.4v 🙈.

Any ideas what to check next? Could the new unit have died that quickly?

1nquawj,Kia Niro main dealer - parking sensor warranty issue,"Kia parking sensors warranty refusal dispute

Can anyone help with advice? 

A few weeks ago during bad weather my 2022 Kia Niro started flagging a parking sensor error/“blockage.” I assumed it had just got wet or dirty and cleaned it, but it didn’t help and the sensors stayed dead.

Unfortunately, a couple of weeks later I dinged the back bumper at low speed in a petrol station (probably because I wasn’t used to reversing without sensors!)

I then received a safety recall notice, so I booked the car into my local Kia dealer (Peter Cooper Kia). While it was in, I asked them to also look at the parking sensor fault. I explained the timeline clearly: sensor failed first, then bumper ding happened afterwards.

Here’s what happened:
	•	On the phone I was told it would probably be a quick fix under warranty.
	•	When I collected the car, I was told the diagnostic showed it wasn’t warranty.
	•	I was charged £99 for diagnostics (to confirm the sensor was broken, which I already knew) and quoted £268 for the sensor on top, so £367 in total which I didn’t go ahead with as I wasn’t prepared for that cost - so I just paid the £99.
	•	The invoice literally says the bumper scuff “may have caused” the fault.
	•	I challenged the £99 fee, saying it was excessive and should be waived if I went ahead with repair (as most garages do). They refused and said it was an hour’s labour.
	•	The service advisor admitted that if the ding had been on the other side of the bumper, they would have replaced the sensor under warranty as they couldn’t prove it either way.

My questions:
	•	Shouldn’t the burden of proof be on Kia to show the ding caused the failure, rather than just saying it may have?
	•	Is £99 a fair charge for a simple diagnostic code read?
	•	Does £367 for identified which sensor and then fixing it sound excessive?
	•	Has anyone had success escalating this to Kia UK or getting the diagnostic refunded?

£99 for diagnostics sounds fair. I’ve seen main dealers that charge £150+ for that. 

The warranty rejecting repair for the rear bumper ding again I think is fair. It’s not ideal but surely you see their point, they’ll naturally only want to fix stuff they are sure is 100% their fault and having a bump throws that into question and in any other case could very well be the reason a sensor would stop working. 

£367 for the sensor replacing, I am unsure about. To me it doesn’t sound the worst, but expensive at the same time if it makes sense. For comparisons sake I had a rear camera replaced on my old car under warranty  (Kia Proceed GT) and when I got the papers back I could see that the rear camera part alone was an absurd £590! 

It might be worth a shot trying another dealer as some are more lenient than others (they get paid good for doing warranty work), but you always risk being in the same scenario and paying another diagnostic fee.

EDIT: I just realised there is a photo of the scratch, and I think they are taking the piss a little there.

ultraboomkin (Score: 1): Parking sensors are delicate little flowers. It really doesn’t take much impact to break one. Just small stone chips from dirt on the road can kill a parking sensor. 

Most warranties won’t cover external damage to parking sensors (ie from stone chips). But, the dealer should be able to demonstrate that there is damage to the sensor. I can’t see enough detail on your photo to judge myself. But at least in my experience working at dealers, it’s a case of “if I can see chips/damage on the sensor, decline warranty; if no damage visible, go through warranty.”

As for the £99 diagnostic fee, that’s a standard and reasonable price for any basic diagnostic job. When you signed the paperwork when you dropped the car off, it will have said something like, “We cannot confirm in advance whether your repair is covered under warranty. If it is not covered by warranty, you will be charged £99”

Regarding the repair cost, that sounds fair to me. 1 hour fitting and £100 odd for the sensor.

hoetel_kuntz (Score: 1): Did they not mention on the phone that it would be a £99 diagnostic check should it not come under warranty, i would argue that they should have checked before authorising, unless you told them prior you were happy to pay £99 if warranty didnt cover it."

1nqtr0p,Car insurance question  - is £150 pcm normal for a 2018 Toyota Auris (2018)?,"**Background**  
My partner who is the driver has been driving for 20 years, but only 3 years out that time has she used her own car, the rest of the time she has used rentals. The car she was driving during that time was a Prius 2005 1.6 i believe, and when she was applying for insurance she accidentaly put down No Claims Discount as 3 years or something (she didn't know what it meant), and the insurance was £50-£70 pcm. Now, I have bought a car for her to drive as the family car and need to get her insured and so am looking into policies. Due to the the fact that the insurance policies for those 3 years she had her own car were changed within a year for each policy has meant that in reality she has zero years No Claims Discount - a full year was never achieved under one policy (this i think was because she was using a black box policy and there was some complications with it). She has never had an accident mind you, though she once got i trouble for doing 38 in a 30 zone and did a course that allowed her not to get points.

**Main Question**  
SO, and this is the main issue, the new car is a Toyota Auris 2018 1.8 litre and the insurance with the accurate NCD applied (0 years) comes to £150 pcm. This seems a bit steep, but is it? We need the car and will have to bit the bullet here on insurance, but I guess im just surprised it's so much?  Why is the price so high, is it the type of car? Or is this just normal? The car is parked on a road near out flat in Lonon too...maybe that explains the high price. Though maybe some here might know of insurance companies that could be cheaper for us?",0,1758867000.0,10,CartalkUK,1759001490,2025-09-26 06:10:00,2025-09-27 19:31:30,"OolonCaluphid (Score: 7): Remember, insurance is much less about the car, and much more about the driver.

The “good” part is a lot of those can be connected (wheel speed sensor failure can trigger ABS/ESC/tyre pressure errors all in one go), so it  might not be as catastrophic as it looks at first glance. But the bad signs are the multiple control module/software failures popping up across different systems — that points to either some major electrical gremlins or sketchy past repairs.

If it were me, I’d be leaning towards rejection while you still can. Chasing down random electronic faults on a modern Volvo gets expensive really quick, and the fact you’re already seeing glow plug and intake runner codes too doesn’t exactly scream “easy fix.” Better to cut your losses early than end up sinking money into something you just bought.
