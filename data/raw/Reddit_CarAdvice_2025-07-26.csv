I have a 2013 Nissan Rogue SV AWD (googled the engine and it says it’s a 2.5 liter 4-cylinder engine) and last year (almost exactly a year ago) my dad replaced the clockspring in it for me after doing some diagnostics.

Are the radiator fans working properly?  If you have a fan mounted on a pulley that is spun by the accessory (serpentine) belt, the fan clutch might be shot.  It is hard to tell, the fan will spin if the clutch is bad, but it won't spin ""enough"" to work properly.

So, took it to several shops (including Nissan) and finally got the P0101 code off by having them reset the PCM (a bulletin was out on it that I was never aware of) but the smoke coming from the tailpipe for the snap test is still there.

To note, it’s not a lot and I never seen it before/been told I had any issues. 

More details - I went back to Nissan and they told me to use a thicker oil because my car is burning oil, so I did that and still, there is smoke. I then got a tune up (sparks replaced and etc.) and the shop did a quick snap test and there’s still smoke. To note, I got the tune up done because I never changed them out after reach 105k+ miles.

We own an element that does something similar. Gets worse the hotter it is and will settle down if i stop driving it like an asshole. 

It probably needs a belt and tensioner. So does yours. Tensioners “feeling strong” doesn’t mean they are. I recently did a belt on our 03 Camry. Tensioner felt good still. 2 weeks later it’s rattling. The new tensioner took twice the effort to move back. We got 5 years and 70k out of a Napa tensioner. 

Replaced all this on a Trax last week. The new tensioner had my 270lb built like a brick shithouse looking like I had the strength of a boy with a 3/8 breaker bar to get enough slack for the belt to slip on. 

American cars of older lineage relied on a lot of tensioner swing to keep the belt tight. Imports use a short swing with a *lot* of tension. If you didn’t struggle with that tensioner it is tired. I’ve been servicing our 06 element since 2011, multiple belts and tensioners in that time and it’s always a “motherfucker just MOVE so I can get this damn belt OONNN…thank you damn” for 45* of rotation lol

1m97whr,Please Help! Check engine light keeps coming on after several repairs.,"Hi guys, 
This is a pretty long post but i’m really frustrated about the situation and just need answers. 
I have a 2017 Subaru Impreza that I bought from a used Subaru dealership back in January 25. Around the beginning of June I was in my car eating lunch when my check engine light came on. I thought it was weird and started googling what it could be. It was driving completely normal at the time. I thought maybe I didn’t have my gas caps on good enough so I went to fill up my tank and made sure to screw it on good. After that I drove almost 600 miles for a weekend trip. The car acted completely normal the whole trip so I assumed that it was just the gas cap. After I got back from the trip I was sitting in my car eating lunch and my check engine light came on again. I put it in drive and started to ride it around and noticed that when I would accelerate it would hesitate and it would take a while to get up to a good speed. I also noticed that when I was sitting in idle the engine would jolt or shake a little bit. I had my uncle come and look at it and we got Autozone to pull the codes and it gave us a P2011 code. My uncle replaced the air filter and added some fuel additive to see if that would help and I decided to take it to an auto shop that my uncle recommended me to. the majority of the conversations that I had with this shop also went through my uncle because he knows more about this stuff than I do. They ran the codes and it showed the P2011 code. The shop decided that the sensors for the intake manifold were failing and I would have to replace the entire intake manifold be Subaru doesn’t manufacture the sensors separately. So I approved the job and paid for it, almost $2000. Everyone seemed to agree that after this part was replaced I wouldn’t have anymore issues. I pick the car up from the shop and it drive normal again. About a week later i’m driving down the road and the engine light pops back up and it immediately starts to hesitate and loose power again. I drive it back to the shop and they immediately seem confused and say that they’ll check it out. They call my uncle and tell him that there’s still some electrical issues they didn’t see the first time and that they’ll need to replace the EMC Board. I told them I wasn’t going to pay for anything and sense the work they did for the intake manifold was covered under warranty they ordered the part and replaced it for free, they also had to send it to the actual Subaru Dealership to be programmed. After this the shop told me I’d basically have a brand new car and I shouldn’t have any more issues. I picked it up and it drove normal again for about 2 weeks. I was sitting in my car again for lunch one day and the check engine light came back on, im fed up at this point and call my uncle. He calls the shop and I bring it back in. They seemed frustrated about it too and the shop ends up re wiring a significant portion of the car for free and they again seemed hopeful that it’ll be the end of the issues. I picked it up from the shop and it drove completely normal for another 2 weeks. That brings me to this past Monday. I was sitting in my car for lunch and the check engine light comes on. I put it in reverse and start driving it straight to the shop. As soon as I start driving it I can immediately tell something was way different. It wasn’t like the last 3 times. This time along with my check engine light my traction control lights were also on. I turned the car off and tried to crank it back on and it had a pretty long crank. When I would press on the acceleration the car would jolt back and it would struggle to get to 15mph. I could get it going about 40mph but it took it a while because if I would press on the gas too hard it would immediately jolt back. I got it to the shop and they ran the codes and said that it was now pulling a different code so I left my keys with them to do more testing. This is when they started charging me for stuff. They tried to charge me over $300 dollars for 2 different levels of testing and then another $300 to replace the OBD reader in my car because it was “falling apart” They never said anything about my OBD reader being in bad condition before this but they insisted they could go forward with testing until it was replaced. My uncle got pissed off about it and just told them to clear the codes so I could pick up the car. I go pick up the car and I drive it to the bank because I’m thinking that i’ll probably just have to trade it in and get something else so but it was driving fine then. On my way home from work that night the lights come back on and it immediately starts to drive pretty badly. I pull over because I wasn’t comfortable driving that slow on the busy road I was on and call AAA to tow it to the actual Subaru Dealership. I call the dealership and let them know so they will have it scheduled to be looked at. When the tow guy came to pick it up he cranked the car and again had a pretty long crank but it finally started. He got out and immediately said that it was just my fuel pump/filter. He sounded pretty confident about it and I let him know that it had been in and out of the shop for about 2 months. He got it to drive up on the truck and took it to the dealership shop Wednesday night. It’s mid afternoon friday now and I keep calling the dealership for updates and they say they’re working on it and will have someone call me with an update soon. I don’t want to be too overbearing though so I’m just waiting it out at this point. I’ve just paid for them to do their diagnostic testing on it and figure out what’s wrong. They haven’t said anything about my OBD reader so I’m starting to think the other shop was just bullshitting me. If it’s something that can be fixed for a reasonable price i’ll do it, I certainly don’t want a different car it’s been a really nice car and I like it. But I can’t keep dealing with the same issues over and over so whatever the dealership tells me will depend on if I trade it in or not. I’ve been looking up about fuel pump failures and the symptoms seem pretty similar to what i’m dealing with but I just want to see what you guys think it could be.

Fuel pumps can get weaker overtime but I've seen more direct it either works or doesn't type failures. The filter has a chance of being old and needing replaced, but that to me doesn't explain the traction control light. All in all I think best course of action is to have the car replicate the failure while connected to a live data OBD2 scanner with an eye on fuel pressure and temps etc. In my 04 outback it will turn off VDC if it gets hotter than it would like to be, and that's trac control etc.. so I wonder if it's not a cooling issue of some sort and the car attempting to go into limp. Either way best of luck. Fuel filter should be cheap enough but for some reason I'm thinking heat.

1m97qcn,To bleed or not to bleed,"I come to this sub Reddit today with a simple inquiry regarding changing brakes. The first time I was taught how to change pads and rotors way back when I was taught that you needed to open up the cap on the brake fluid reservoir, loosen up the little bleeder nut and push the piston all the way back in on the caliper. Then when you’re all done you bleed the brakes to get the air out of the line, top off the reservoir and voila. Then more recently I had an old head mechanic tell me that there ain’t no reason to do all of that. That you can just push the piston back in and then you don’t have to bleed the brakes at all.

1m97p94,"Probably cracked transmission drain bolt hole, as well as stripped it (Ford Fusion 2011 3.0L v6, 6f35 transmission)","I have no previous experience working on cars, and my first real work I did was a transmission fluid change. Everything went well, except for me way over tightening the drain bolt. I have a Haynes manual for the car, and when I looked back at the book after messing up the bolt, I realized the mistake I made. 106 in-lbs is listed as the torque spec for that drain bolt. One line below that, the torque spec for a different bolt is 29 ft-lbs. not knowing any better due to this being my first mechanical experience, I tried to tighten the bolt to 29 ft lbs, stripping it and cracking the drain hole. At least I think those are cracks in the picture. I left it alone, put the underbody shield back on, and for now am going to try to fix with JB weld and a nut insert. If this were a different car, I could just get a new transmission pan. However, the 6f35 has the drain bolt at the bottom of the transmission case. There is no “pan”. So, to truly fix this, it would require pulling the transmission and replacing the entire transmission case. I don’t want to have to tell my dad I broke the car this badly. If I do that he will likely take my tools and/or car away, because we have a fairly nice house and he resents me “working on the car with oil stains on the ground, making the driveway look trashy”. I think he’s being stupid. I’m trying to get into a hobby that could make me money in the future, and save him money in the long run.

If you're sure you have the correct part, try orienting the shaft with the open side of the C-clip facing up.  It may also help to rotate the opposite side hub.

Your fault codes are a typical array of communication errors, not uncommon for any Ford of this year range. 

It could be that either participant of the high speed CAN network is not communicating and therefore the immobiliser does not unlock. Your best bet would be to use an OBD2 scanner again to try and connect with the individual modules, if you cannot access the instrument cluster or the PCM, there is your problem. Alternatively, any participant of the high speed CAN network may be faulty and disturb the signal going to and fro the control units. 

And the simplest reason for a fault like this may just be a dead battery also. If the relevant modules like the PCM don't get enough power or stable ground connection, things won't work. Damage in the CAN bus wiring also can lead to these symptoms.

The radiator fan works differently.  It goes by coolant temperature.  If you vehicle temp reaches a certain threshold, it will activate, regardless of driving speed.  While you are driving, there is air forced through the radiator so a lot of times that fan has no need to come on.

1m91go1,Can’t get a firm brake pedal after full system rebuild – Porsche 924,"Hey all,

I’ve rebuilt the entire brake system on my ’79 Porsche 924 (non-turbo, manual brakes with servo, drums in the rear), and I’m stuck trying to get a firm pedal.

# What I’ve done:

* New master cylinder (ATE)
* All new hard lines (copper-nickel, hand-bent)
* New soft lines (all 4)
* New rear cylinders, shoes, springs – everything
* Adjusted the shoes so they’re snug, drums have drag

**1.** I’ve bled the system three full times (pressure bleeder + pedal help), in the right order (RR &gt; RL &gt; FR &gt; FL). No visible leaks anywhere. Still, the pedal has a soft section before firming up. It doesn’t go to the floor, but it’s definitely not as firm as it should be.

2. I plugged all the outlets on the master cylinder to test it, and the pedal felt solid, so I could be sure the MC was all right.

**3.** I plugged the other ports on the master and bled only the front-left circuit (short and easy line). Did gravity bleeding twice until no bubbles. Then fired up the car and pumped the pedal a few times. The pedal is hard-ish, but still has a bit of soft travel at the top. The caliper moves. I’d expect this line to be rock solid by now.

**Could I still have air in the master o in the rest of the cirucit after 3 attempts? Even in this super short line? Would reverse bleeding help? I’ve tried using a big syringe before and it was a mess – thinking about trying a drill pump or a proper fluid transfer pump.**

Anyone else run into weird bleeding issues with drum rears and a T-fitting like this setup. Is it normal for a new master cylinder to take several full purges before the pedal firms up completely?

Any advice appreciated. I’ve put a lot of time into this and just want to get the car back on the road. Happy to post pics or details if needed.

Assuming it has one, and that you bled correctly:

A faulty brake booster can definitely cause a soft or spongy brake pedal. The brake booster is designed to amplify the force you apply to the brake pedal, making braking easier. A faulty booster will reduce this amplification, leading to a pedal that feels soft because it requires more effort to engage the brakes.  It sounds counter intuitive ...  But it's a lot like why the moon looks big when it's near the horizon.  It's actually the same size, it's just a optical illusion.  Think of this the same way -- It's not that the pedal IS soft .. It's that it FEELS soft at the top COMPARED to when it hardens up.

That said check for a vacuum leak or other internal issues in the booster."

I’ll attach a few pictures but not sure they’ll help at all. After getting everything all back together and waiting for the rtv to cure. I started it up and could hear a ticking/rubbing noise coming from the rear valve cover on the timing chain side. Almost like the timing chain was rubbing on cover. I let the engine sit over night and took the engine cover back off and felt all around the valve cover and it doesn’t seem to be leaking at all. I don’t hear any whistling or suction sounds when the engine is running. After starting it again this morning it seems like the noise is starting to go away, but I’m only running the engine for a few seconds. Checked the oil and it was about half full so I topped it off as well as the power steering fluid since most of it drained while needing to move it out of the way. I did have to leave the back valve cover off overnight before putting it back on but had everything covered. I’m hoping this could be normal and everything just needs more time to run to get lubricated. I did following the tightening sequence but did not use a torque wrench because mine just broke. I know the first recommendation is going to be getting a new torque wrench and loosen an retorque them.

1m90xv0,Getting Into The Industry,"Hello everyone,

I recently developed a likeness to vehicles and how they operate in my late 20s. In terms of life &amp; career paths, nothing has worked for me yet &amp; I’m still stuck in a position I wouldn’t wish upon my enemies. Assuming 3rd party funding is approved, I should be set to go to school to become a dealership garage mechanic(at least that’s what the college advertises). Recently, I lost my job, in an unrelated field, and accepted an oil change tech job at one of my local quicklube spots.

I’ve done some work on my own vehicle such as, axles, brakes, vac pump del(Lmk if you can guess what I drive as as result of the work I’ve done!). I get that feeling of knowing that I did that &amp; what’s the next mod?!?!? I just wish I was faster at it. Moreover, my mental health is crumbling the further I continue to work in fields that require more human interaction. I can’t get upset with a car part like I can with humans and I’ve been trying to lean into that problem solving facet of it more as I go into it. I have some interesting ideas as well for my future but that’s really far down the line, tbf

So, in essence, I’m trying to set myself up to get my foot in the door &amp; make a career out of this. I’m really interested in getting some takes from seasoned mechanics. Is this the right path with where the industry is at? Should I be looking at other options &amp; if so, where? What are some things you wish you knew before you went into this as a career? What would you do differently if you had the choice? Etc.

Faulty ECM (less common)

Common Symptoms:
Engine cranks but won’t start
Rough idle or misfires

What You Can Do:

1. Check Fuses – Make sure the fuses powering the FICM are not blown.

2. Inspect Wiring & Connectors – Look at the harness going to the FICM (usually near the intake manifold or firewall). Check for:

Damaged, pinched, or corroded wires

Loose or dirty connectors

3. Check CAN Bus Continuity – If you have a multimeter and wiring diagram, check the resistance between CAN High and CAN Low lines (should be ~60 ohms across the network).

4. Scan Tool – If you have access to a bi-directional scan tool, check if other modules are losing communication or if the FICM is showing up at all."

1m8rcnh,Looking for advice on how to deal with a shops pricing,"Was looking for some input on my current situation with my car that's at a mechanic shop right now. So i took my turboed car into this mechanic shop to fix a leak on the exhaust manifold along with getting it tuned. Mechanic told me it would be $175/hr to do the tune along with $150/hr for repairs on the car which was fine with me. Took the car in and after being in the shop for a week the mechanic called me say that he put in a spacer ($40) and two gaskets ($20 ea) and fixed the leak on the exhaust, but was calling to inform me that the Parking brake lever had broken and needed to be replaced (worked fine for the 6 years ive owned the car) and quoted me $250 for the assembly along with an hour of labor to put it in. Gave him the OK and ended the call. A week later he called to tell me the pedal position sensor was bad and needed a new one. Quoted 150 for the part along with 1 hour of labor for it. Today, after having the car at the shop for 4 weeks, the mechanic called me to tell me the car was ready for pickup that they had driven it about 60 miles to test all the parts they put in, but that they had to replace the EVAP caninster (which they never called me to get an OK on it) to get the check engine light to clear. Told the mechanic it was fine that id be there tomorrow to pick it up. I asked for a total on the work and the mechanic said it was $6,925.16. Calculated the parts to about 1.1k including the labor rate/mark up and guessed about 1k for the tune which would be about 5 hours of tuning the vehicle at their rate. So $2,100 in parts leaves us with about $4,800 which at their rate would be at around 30 hours to take off the downpipe, intake, 1 intercooler elbow to the turbo tip/ Wastegate, and exhaust manifold to throw in 2 gaskets and 1 spacer  Thoughts on this bullshit?

I can't tell exactly from the video what it is, but in general suspension noises can be found by jacking up the front end of the car and removing the wheels to inspect parts for excessive play. 

Sometimes the culprit is obvious, sometimes it's not and you drive yourself insane over the course of three months while losing sleep over trying to analyze the waveform of the sound at 2am.

If you want to take a look, watch a quick video that describes the suspension components of your car and start pulling on those parts to see what moves or knocks. 

It's usually the stabilizer links, but not always. There's plenty of stuff down there to knock around. The stabilizer bar/sway bar also has a couple bushings along it that can wear out, but you'll probably have to crawl under the car and remove bolts to check those out. Replace parts in pairs, if one side goes out the other probably isn't far behind.

Edit: Kinda sounds like control arms knocking around on a second watch. You can look at the bushings on them and visually see if they are intact or not."

My engine was replaced and covered due to a warranty. I finally get my car back after 3+ weeks. (Im so happy!). We'll it didn't last.

As soon as I get into my car, I turn the AC on, (it typically takes about 5 mins to start to feel COLD if vehilce is in direct sunlight and idelling.) Once I started driving, typically that helps the compressor a lot with the AC from the power and the engine. But i couldn't help noticing an issue with the AC RIGHT AWAY!
I mean, right off the dealerships lot. 
I picked the car up late so the service department was closed so I called the following day.
The first thing the gentleman said to me was, ""How do you know it was due to the replacement of the engine?"" 

Now, I want to be very clear. I am not a mechanic. I do handy man work on the side, but i am not a vehicle service tech. 

HOWEVER, I do have common sense and do understand how an AC works.
Whether that be a compressor or an evaporating coil, OR an example would be (if i worked on your hot water heater, and after i say "" it's fixed "" and leave. You notice you now you have a leak coming from the water heater. 

More than likely, it probably was due to me not doing something correctly... With me so far? Lol
So,
You had an issue that was not working, I ""repaired"" it, left, and it is no longer working properly. (Even more than the original issue)

More than likely, it would be due to whatever service was done. Whether that be a car, a home, or anything. Now, i was unable to leave my car at the dealership for OVER a WEEK. AGAIN!
I have to arrange my schedule and blah blah blah.

Finally get the car in the shop. 
A couple of days later, I get a call saying my evaporator coil has a ""pine whole"" leak, and this is why you are experiencing warm air on the driver's side of the vehicle, and cold air on the passenger side. 

Now, at the time of the replacement of the engine, I was still under a warranty that would be able to fix and cover the evaporator coil. All of a sudden, now, i finally get the car back in the shop, and my warranty expired. 
A MONTH  AGO!? 

My service representative went ahead and contacted corporate, and wanted to see if they would be able to do something to work with me sense It had only expired a month ago. Initially, the cost for this fix is around $3,700.

They responded with being able to take care of $2,850, and i would have to pay the remainder, which is $850.

Well, not only do I not have $850 to go ahead and fix an issue that I did not have prior to the vehicle being worked on, I also stated , that while the engine was being replaced, The warranty it was active!!!

So in my mind, that tells me that because the issue had happened while under warranty, and I also had contacted the dealership while it was still under warranty. We shouldn't have an issue with the coverage.

It should be covered regardless now. I may be wrong about that. That's just how I look at things. (Also, im not an attorney) But I'd like to revert back to my story about the hot water tank.

Servicing your hot water tank. Now, when I do something like that, there is no warranty, okay? Regardless of if there was a warranty or not, that homeowner would immediately
Get in touch with me, explain the situation, and expect me to fix it. 

Which I would because if it's not done right, it's not done right or if I had done something wrong. I had done something wrong, and It needs to be fixed properly. 

That's just how I was brought up, but I also thought that is the right way to conduct business. 

So now I'm in a little bit of a dilemma. 
I'm not sure how to go about this issue.

Since both compressors have made this noise, it is time for you to look elsewhere for the source.

Those two things can cause marginal components in your accessory drive system to misbehave when it is running.

If it has an automatic belt tensioner, I'd check that to see if it is moving around excessively when the compressor is on.

I have a 2010 Toyota aurion that I've had a weird electrical issue with for the last couple of years. 
Normally only happens when it's cold but not always, sometimes I'd be driving along fine then turn on my high beams which would cause it to drop any/all radio, air con and cluster for a split second or so. Sometimes I'd drive completely fine to work, jump in after work and the air con would be in default setting like I'd lost power, and once or twice the clock was reset. 
I've now had 2 issues where the car wouldn't start, once I had been driving it fine then it refused to start again, acting like a flat battery. 
Now today, after multiple days of random issues like the above, my car refuses to start. 
Battery is fine, I've checked it and everything electrical works no worries (cluster, radio, air con etc), strangely the keyless door unlock didn't work, and it takes a second after the brake pedal is pushed for the push start light to turn on, and it acts like a dead battery, weak flicker on start, engine not turning at all, and sometimes but not always that little ticking noise. 
Now to me that sounds like a flat battery or dodgy starter but considering the above issues I'm thinking it's a dodgy earth or something similar but I can't seem to find it (I'm not great with electricals).

Car recently lost ""First"" or ""Low"" gear?","Previously, if you push just fast enough, the low end torque on this car would allow it to squeal the front wheels. Previous owner (a coworker) did it once, and I was able to replicate it once by mistake on a wet ground

But recently the car sat for a while, this caused it to lose battery charge and I assume theres some gunk thats holding up a solenoid somewhere that supposed to allow it to shift back to first gear on idle.

When trying to move from a stop, I can tell its starting from 2nd gear as the revs no longer dip around 13mph as thats typically the point when the 1st gear (low) is done pushing the car forward and shifts to 2nd. 

Instead, you'll get a high rev followed by a VERY death slow movement of the car until the rev limiter hits 3k. and then it goes to 3rd and then overdrive as I have gauged it out over prolonged use. My mechanic changed the fluid which he said was very dirty, he also changed the filter.

1m8m3wr,2003 Civic Overheating Issues,"Hey all, need some advice. 

Car Information: 2003 Honda Civic EX, 4 Door Sedan, Front-Wheel Drive, 1.7L L4 Gas


I’ve been driving my manual civic for about 10 years now and it’s at ~190k miles. The past few weeks, I’ve been having heating issues and while I’ve fixed a few of the issues, the engine keeps overheating. 

 At first, I figured it was a radiator issue, since the initial problem came when the upper overflow tube snapped and started spraying coolant in the engine bay. I replaced the radiator myself, and discovered the radiator fan had melted as well and its fuse was blown, so I replaced those too.

Now, the fans work, but the engine starts overheating almost immediately when I start it up, but here’s the kicker, the engine temp gauge isn’t reacting to the engine’s heat. Seems to take a while to start pushing liquid through? Other thing here is, the car overheats quicker on the road when I turn the AC on?

When I bleed the coolant, there seems to be bubbling for longer than is reasonable, and some of the liquid in the coolant funnel looks greasy. 

So I’m thinking, is this a head gasket? I’m leaning towards gasket, but wanted to get some outsider opinions. 

I’ve done some repairs on it, but this seems like it’ll be a bit tougher than other small things here and there. Should I try repairing it, or is it too much of a hassle?

Think of a high performance camshaft blub blub blub. If it runs well off idle I wouldn't worry about it too much. Chevys are known for having lifter issues like many single cam v engines.

The mechanic added a splash of Irontite Ceramic Motor Seal and gave me the rest of the bottle. He said that should hold it for awhile and if I need to I can add splash of the ceramic motor seal to the system. 

Reading the instructions on the bottle, you are supposed to drain and flush the coolant first, add the ceramic motor seal with water and run it for 2 days, then drain again to remove excess sealer and add your coolant. 

How important really is it to do all of these steps? It’s been about a month of driving it now as is and remarkably the coolant doesn’t seem to be burning off anymore.

1m8kgfc,A/C issue help?,"I’m curious if anyone can potentially point me in the right direction at home before I return a vehicle to the mechanic, as it’s a bit inconvenient to be without the vehicle for periods of time and want to see if I can make the A/C useful until we can get the car back in. I’ll try and keep it brief:

I have a 2011 Nissan Quest that had air conditioning recently repaired (replaced the compressor and seems like every year or two lately it’s had some bad o-rings/seals that need replacing), and shortly after that A/C repair a rusted out coolant hose joint was replaced. When I got the van back this second time, the A/C once again was not working - i checked at home and the pressure was reading low, so I did a quick leak stopper and recharge, and that got things working fine again - it was good for about 3-4 weeks. However, today the A/C quit working again, and it’s also out of coolant (obviously it needs to go back to the shop to see what didn’t work, but in the meantime I’d like to get the A/C back). This time, when I attached the recharge tool back to the low pressure it was reading in the warning range, around 150psi, so I released it down to a safe level, and topped up the engine coolant, but A/C still isn’t blowing cold. I’ll mention there are no warning lights on the dash as well. 

This is a trustworthy mechanic we’ve used successfully for a long time, so I’m guessing something deeper got missed that we have to take back, however I’d like to see if I can get this A/C running since the vehicle wont be seen for a bit, and it’s real hot out this weekend lol.

For eyeball measurements, remember that the backing plate of the pad is almost universally 5mm thick. Most manufacturers will say replacement is due when the pad material is around 2mm. So, when you eyeball measure, compare the thickness of the pad material vs the thickness of the backing plate, and if it looks like the material is about half, then it's probably time.

Most inspection software I've seen at the dealer level will start requiring a recommendation be made when you put in a measurement of 5mm or less.

That could signify a malfunctioning caliper that should be addressed ASAP. 

Also, there are 4 rear pads and you’ve only shown us 2, so… who knows? Could be worse on the other side.

At the end of the day, brakes are just regular maintenance. In this modern age, new pads and rotors are the standard, even if slightly wasteful/overkill. This is because rotors are thinner than they used to be (for cost and weight savings), so they don’t reliably last as long.

Do you still have the old compressor? From this pic of an oem used compressor  it looks like there are 2 connections. Many of the new compressors I looked up had only 1 connection.

Its also possible its an unused wire. Sometimes there are different versions of the same exact model for that year and sometimes there are differences in where they were manufactured. Meaning it may be an extra on some and used on others. Dont ignore the wire though. It may be needed. If you dont have access to old compressor check with dealer to look up oem compressor. Also sometimes universal part listings are wrong.

Hope this helps.

You didnt really give us much to go on. Wouldve been better if you had pics of your compressor too. Just taking a pic of a single wire with nothing to reference just leaves us guessing.

1m96frj,I keep making the scratches worse,"I had some relatively minor scratches on my Rav4 that you could only see up close. But, it's a new car to me, and I wanted to fix them. I didn't know what I was in for. I got the paint code, ordered some polymer fill for the deep scratches, and ordered a ""paint pen"" from a 3rd party that is supposed to 'exact match' my car color. 

I wet sanded down the deep scratches, and filled them. Easy peasy. Then came the paint pen. The results were not good, it was clumpy, textured, and much darker than my vehicle. You could see it a mile away. So I did what any logical person would do, and wet sanded down all the scratches I had painted. You might not believe me but it looks better now than it did with the paint. 

Now my vehicle looks like the pictures. 
How do I salvage this (other than calling in a pro and paying a lot of money)? 
Do I sand it down more and in a larger area, tape it off, and buy an OEM aerosol kit with the color coat and clear coat, and see if I have any skill with spray paint? Is doubling/tripling down a bad idea at this point?

My engine was replaced and covered due to a warranty. I finally get my car back after 3+ weeks. (Im so happy!). We'll it didn't last.

As soon as I get into my car, I turn the AC on, (it typically takes about 5 mins to start to feel COLD if vehilce is in direct sunlight and idelling.) Once I started driving, typically that helps the compressor a lot with the AC from the power and the engine. But i couldn't help noticing an issue with the AC RIGHT AWAY!
I mean, right off the dealerships lot. 
I picked the car up late so the service department was closed so I called the following day.
The first thing the gentleman said to me was, ""How do you know it was due to the replacement of the engine?"" 

Now, I want to be very clear. I am not a mechanic. I do handy man work on the side, but i am not a vehicle service tech. 

HOWEVER, I do have common sense and do understand how an AC works.
Whether that be a compressor or an evaporating coil, OR an example would be (if i worked on your hot water heater, and after i say "" it's fixed "" and leave. You notice you now you have a leak coming from the water heater. 

More than likely, it probably was due to me not doing something correctly... With me so far? Lol
So,
You had an issue that was not working, I ""repaired"" it, left, and it is no longer working properly. (Even more than the original issue)

More than likely, it would be due to whatever service was done. Whether that be a car, a home, or anything. Now, i was unable to leave my car at the dealership for OVER a WEEK. AGAIN!
I have to arrange my schedule and blah blah blah.

Finally get the car in the shop. 
A couple of days later, I get a call saying my evaporator coil has a ""pine whole"" leak, and this is why you are experiencing warm air on the driver's side of the vehicle, and cold air on the passenger side. 

Now, at the time of the replacement of the engine, I was still under a warranty that would be able to fix and cover the evaporator coil. All of a sudden, now, i finally get the car back in the shop, and my warranty expired. 
A MONTH  AGO!? 

My service representative went ahead and contacted corporate, and wanted to see if they would be able to do something to work with me sense It had only expired a month ago. Initially, the cost for this fix is around $3,700.

They responded with being able to take care of $2,850, and i would have to pay the remainder, which is $850.

Well, not only do I not have $850 to go ahead and fix an issue that I did not have prior to the vehicle being worked on, I also stated , that while the engine was being replaced, The warranty it was active!!!

So in my mind, that tells me that because the issue had happened while under warranty, and I also had contacted the dealership while it was still under warranty. We shouldn't have an issue with the coverage.

It should be covered regardless now. I may be wrong about that. That's just how I look at things. (Also, im not an attorney) But I'd like to revert back to my story about the hot water tank.

Servicing your hot water tank. Now, when I do something like that, there is no warranty, okay? Regardless of if there was a warranty or not, that homeowner would immediately
Get in touch with me, explain the situation, and expect me to fix it. 

Which I would because if it's not done right, it's not done right or if I had done something wrong. I had done something wrong, and It needs to be fixed properly. 

That's just how I was brought up, but I also thought that is the right way to conduct business. 

So now I'm in a little bit of a dilemma.

A leak anywhere affects the entire system. If you vehicle uses multiple evaporators ,it might be possible that there is a low volume of refrigerant and the dealer is using a leak diagnosis to recover the difference of a warranty engine replacement and retail replacement.

I'm currently working on a low budget ITB turbo setup, and I'm looking for cost effective ways to manage engine bay temperatures.

To keep things affordable, here’s my current plan:

* I'll fabricate a custom heat shield to sit over the exhaust manifold and turbo area.
* The manifold is a cheap cast-iron log style turbo header, which I plan to reinforce and add bracing to the turbo to reduce stress on the header.
* I’m avoiding heat wraps, since they tend to trap moisture and cause cracking.
* Ceramic coatings like Cerakote are out of my budget.

Would spraying the exhaust manifold with Rust-Oleum High Heat 2000°F paint actually help reduce engine bay temperatures at all? I know it won’t perform like a true ceramic coating, but I’m hoping for at least some improvement.

1m8ktcj,Mysterious Intermittent Brake Noise - Seeking Advice/Ideas,"Hi everyone, I'm hoping to get some thoughts or ideas on a very frustrating and confusing brake noise I'm experiencing with my car, as I'm getting conflicting information and can't pinpoint it. I want to keep this car running as long as possible, so getting this resolved is important. **Car:** 2005 Ford Five Hundred **The Problem:** I'm hearing a loud, harsh noise from the front brake area when I'm pressing or sometimes releasing the brake pedal. The sound is best described as grinding, crackling, or screeching (like ""teeth grinding""). It's highly intermittent – it doesn't happen every time I brake, but can occur multiple times during a trip (when pulling out of the parking lot, or multiple times on a commute). It seems to happen whenever it wants to. **Crucial Timeline/Context:** This is a NEW noise; it was not present when I first got the car a couple of years ago. It specifically started/became noticeable AFTER my stabilizer links were recently replaced. I initially thought it was related to them, but now realize it's a distinct brake noise. **What I've Done So Far:** First, I took it to **Shop #1, where they** ***did*** **hear the noise**, but told me it was ""normal"" due to ""pressure"" and wouldn't go away. This didn't sound right to me. Then, I just had a free brake inspection at **Shop #2**. The technician said the brake pads look good (plenty of material), and they checked calipers and other components. They drove it, even tried hard braking, but **could not reproduce or hear the noise** themselves. They said it's ""safe"" and to bring it back if it gets worse so they can pinpoint it. **My Confusion:** I'm confused because I clearly hear this concerning grinding/crackling noise, one shop *heard it* but called it ""normal,"" and the other shop *couldn't hear it at all* during their check. **Seeking Your Input:** Has anyone experienced a similar intermittent grinding/crackling/screeching brake noise that mechanics struggled to diagnose or that was dismissed as ""normal""? What could be causing this type of noise if the pads look good and it's so intermittent? Any ideas on why it's so hard to pinpoint, or what additional information I should be gathering if it continues? Any advice or shared experiences would be incredibly helpful as I try to get this figured out for my car's longevity and my family's safety.

A car with an automatic transmission is always trying to move forward, even when you have your foot on the brake. As you let off the brake, the pressure on the pads gets low enough, they slip, and depending on quite a few factors (tempature of brakes, rotor surface, pad surface, pad material and other such), they will have the brake rotors dragged along them by the engine.



This will only happen at very low speed (like slower than walking pace).



I've personally noticed that cheaper semi-metallic brake pads get especially loud as they age.


The best way to reduce the noise is to be more aggressive with the pedal and not creeping forward with your foot on the brake.


The first shop was right. This is normal.


The second shop probably did hear it, but the technician told the service advisor that they didn't hear anything because, to someone who works on cars daily, its a completely expected sound.


In my opinion, the quietest pads are ceramic material based, although those require rotors designed for them.

My engine was replaced and covered due to a warranty. I finally get my car back after 3+ weeks. (Im so happy!). We'll it didn't last.

As soon as I get into my car, I turn the AC on, (it typically takes about 5 mins to start to feel COLD if vehilce is in direct sunlight and idelling.) Once I started driving, typically that helps the compressor a lot with the AC from the power and the engine. But i couldn't help noticing an issue with the AC RIGHT AWAY!
I mean, right off the dealerships lot. 
I picked the car up late so the service department was closed so I called the following day.
The first thing the gentleman said to me was, ""How do you know it was due to the replacement of the engine?"" 

Now, I want to be very clear. I am not a mechanic. I do handy man work on the side, but i am not a vehicle service tech. 

HOWEVER, I do have common sense and do understand how an AC works.
Whether that be a compressor or an evaporating coil, OR an example would be (if i worked on your hot water heater, and after i say "" it's fixed "" and leave. You notice you now you have a leak coming from the water heater. 

More than likely, it probably was due to me not doing something correctly... With me so far? Lol
So,
You had an issue that was not working, I ""repaired"" it, left, and it is no longer working properly. (Even more than the original issue)

More than likely, it would be due to whatever service was done. Whether that be a car, a home, or anything. Now, i was unable to leave my car at the dealership for OVER a WEEK. AGAIN!
I have to arrange my schedule and blah blah blah.

Finally get the car in the shop. 
A couple of days later, I get a call saying my evaporator coil has a ""pine whole"" leak, and this is why you are experiencing warm air on the driver's side of the vehicle, and cold air on the passenger side. 

Now, at the time of the replacement of the engine, I was still under a warranty that would be able to fix and cover the evaporator coil. All of a sudden, now, i finally get the car back in the shop, and my warranty expired. 
A MONTH  AGO!? 

My service representative went ahead and contacted corporate, and wanted to see if they would be able to do something to work with me sense It had only expired a month ago. Initially, the cost for this fix is around $3,700.

They responded with being able to take care of $2,850, and i would have to pay the remainder, which is $850.

Well, not only do I not have $850 to go ahead and fix an issue that I did not have prior to the vehicle being worked on, I also stated , that while the engine was being replaced, The warranty it was active!!!

So in my mind, that tells me that because the issue had happened while under warranty, and I also had contacted the dealership while it was still under warranty. We shouldn't have an issue with the coverage.

It should be covered regardless now. I may be wrong about that. That's just how I look at things. (Also, im not an attorney) But I'd like to revert back to my story about the hot water tank.

Servicing your hot water tank. Now, when I do something like that, there is no warranty, okay? Regardless of if there was a warranty or not, that homeowner would immediately
Get in touch with me, explain the situation, and expect me to fix it. 

Which I would because if it's not done right, it's not done right or if I had done something wrong. I had done something wrong, and It needs to be fixed properly. 

That's just how I was brought up, but I also thought that is the right way to conduct business. 

So now I'm in a little bit of a dilemma.

1m8tjmb,Can autonomous vehicles solve the tourism infrastructure problem?,"I was reading about how Saudi Arabia is using autonomous vehicles in cities like Riyadh and AlUla, and it honestly seems like a smart move. They're using self-driving shuttles, Robotaxis, and even autonomous street sweepers in busy public spaces.

A company called WeRide is behind a lot of it. Their Robotaxis are supposed to launch on Uber later this year, and their shuttle buses are already running in places like medical centers, tourist areas, and residential zones. It's part of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 plan to modernize transportation and support the country's growing tourism industry.

Tourism there is expected to bring in over 100 billion dollars by 2033. Instead of waiting to build out more traditional infrastructure, they're using AVs to connect people between metro stations, hotels, parks, and other key spots. In a hot climate where walking long distances isn't ideal, this setup actually solves real problems.

It reminds me of what companies like Waymo, Cruise, and Tesla have been trying to do in the US, though the rollout there feels slower with more red tape. NVIDIA is also involved in powering a lot of these vehicles globally, including the ones WeRide is deploying. Seeing this kind of integration already happening in the Middle East makes me wonder where we'll see real adoption next.

Ok_Tadpole1661 (Score: 1): Majority of car dealerships are ordering their oil through their manufacturer or through their partner vendors. One brand I worked for had a partnership with castrol and thats what we could order through our normal parts ordering system. We were allowed to buy other brands of oil from other places if we wanted to, but if we provide invoices to the manufacturer that we were using castrol they would subsidize part of that expense. I used a local supplier for castrol and because I was ordering so much they offered us things like the paper floor mats and plastic seat covers and other consumables for free. As for things like gear oil or transmission fluid, dealerships are typically going to get it from their manufacturer and not a 3rd party. 

When it comes to the independent/aftermarket world, most shops have deals in place with their vendors they already order the rest of the parts with and typically ordering specified amounts of oil opens them up for incentives. When it comes to transmission fluid, most independent shops are ordering from the dealer because the fluids aren't just basic Trans fluid anymore. As for gear oil, grease etc I have no idea. 

My opinion as someone who's managed shops of different sizes from corporate dealerships to hole in the wall mom and pop shops, I would expect it to be more beneficial to look into supplying the parts stores rather than trying to make deals with individual shops."

I showed when exactly I let off the gas, when I brake, and how the RPM spikes in the video. since the RPM change is small and quick, it might be hard to catch on the gauge, so i also turned on the live fuel economy screen, you can see the spike there too.

1m8pvgi,weird noise,"i drive a 2013 vw passat tdi. it’s a 2.0. my turbo blew back in october. i replaced it with a new oem borgwarner turbo. ever since the replacement, it’s been making a weird high pitched squeal that has been progressively worsening over the last few months. i took it to two mechanics who couldn’t diagnose the issue but they did tell me what they suspected it could be. when i first replaced the turbo, i did replace all the seals and gaskets with new ones. that being said, i replaced all of them again to rule that out. i then replaced the valve cover and i just replaced the turbo core as well. the mechanics suspected both of those. either a pvc pipe was broken in my old valve cover or when i installed the turbo, i deprived it of oil hence the squeal. even after all those replacements, the noise continues. it seems to happen when its shifting between gears at high rpms, sometimes above 40 as seen in the video or usually when cruising above 60.

His recommendation was to have the dealer replace the spark plugs to see if it fixes the problem. If not, he says it may be a transmission issue.

Regardless, even with the transmission issue, he says the car would still be good for 100,000 miles. If the spark plugs were not the solution, he suggested bringing it in to price a filter replacement and fluid change.

1m8jlwx,Noise  and stalling intermittently,"2016 Kia Forte- 1.8l engine

Hi there! I was just hoping to get maybe some suggestions. My car started making a noise back in late March.  By beginning of April, the noise was still intermittent, but was happening more often.  It stalled on me pulling into a parking lot on two different occasions. We ended up changing the alternator. I was able to drive somewhere 30 minutes away with no noise (which could be a coincidence) and after I left a few hours later, the noise happened again. I was halfway through my drive home and right before I started to make my turn down the main road, the car cut off completely. The previous times it cut off, it turned on immediately after. This time I had to have someone come and jump me. 

I then took it to the most recommended shop in town and they suggested a new alternator as the one that was put on was remanufactured and that they couldn’t replicate the noise I’m hearing. After getting the new alternator, the problem is still happening. I’ve been without a car since and am at a complete loss. Anyone have any suggestions?

Obviously, this wouldn’t be for actual work — more of a “because I can” project. The idea would be to fully modify the frame and drivetrain, maybe reinforce the chassis, and somehow convert the forklift into something that could move with real power at a show or a local drag event. Think burnout machine or crowd-pleaser.

Has anyone ever seen or done something like this before? Would the engine’s size, weight, or torque totally overwhelm the forklift’s original design? What major obstacles would stand in the way aside from the obvious fabrication and safety concerns?

And most importantly — how would you keep it from tipping?",1,1753473304.0,4,AskMechanics,1753560953,2025-07-25 19:55:04,2025-07-26 20:15:53,"thetoastofthefrench (Score: 3): What size forklift?
I won’t be able to answer your question but I know that’s extremely relevant, there are tons of models and sizes of forklifts.

Limp_Bookkeeper_5992 (Score: 1): With enough money anything is possible. There are plenty of big engines in forklifts, your big problems won’t come from space. You’ll quickly run into issues getting the engine connected to the wheels though. Forklifts have low gears meant for high torque at low speeds, so your hemi power isn’t going to do anything but spin wildly when you rev it up. You’d need some pretty serious custom made drivetrain pieces to get a transmission with enough range for racing attached to a differential with a drive ratio high enough you up to speed. 

Of course, then there’s the weight. And the fact that they’re front wheel drive with the weight all over the back wheels. A normal factory floor style forklift with a 8000lb capacity weighs around 12,000lbs. Even a  600hp crate won’t make that a fast truck, it’ll do plenty of burnouts but that thing isn’t going to accelerate worth a damn. 

Oh, and have you ever drove a forklift at top speed? Even at the 20kph or so that your average yard lift tops out at they’re twitchy and need a gentle hand to prevent tipping. A rear steering, front wheel drive, rear weight biased vehicle would be an absolute death trap at anything approaching highway speeds, the chassis setup is just all wrong for driving fast without dying."

For this reason it is typical for most shops to recommend rotors at the same time as pads. If a rotor is in good enough condition to be turned, the labor to turn the rotor may approach the cost of the replacement.

MonsieurReynard (Score: 1): It’s summer. Are you running AC a lot? Maybe letting the car idle a while until the AC cools it down?  That will definitely ding your fuel mileage. 

Check your tire inflation.  Probably the most common cause of changes in fuel mileage.

Those range/fuel mileage displays on your dashboard are inaccurate, always. They calculate your remaining range based on the mileage of your last tank of gas and most recent drive.  So you could fill up and drive on the highway for four hours to a big city. Then fill it in the city, and the range will show “420 miles” or whatever. But then you spend the next day driving around the city in stop and go traffic and you’ll get half that range.  Then you fill it to go home and the dashboard will say you have only 270 miles of range. But then you drive home at 65mph on the highway and actually get 380 miles.  

It’s a lagging indicator, not a real time estimate.  The computer is guessing you’ll keep driving the same way in the same conditions as your last tank of gas. 

The only way to assess your fuel mileage properly is to manually measure it. Fill up, noting exactly how much gas it took to get to the first “click” stop on the pump (and no more!), and note your exact mileage, check the tires, remove excess weight, set the trip odometer  to zero, and go drive a couple hours on the highway at normal speeds but trying  to keep it steady at 60 or 65 at most. (The EPA doesn’t speed.) 

Close the windows and run the AC on recirc. Try to find a level stretch of 50-100 miles with minimal grade changes. Don’t pass people, just keep it as steady as you can.  Ideally you’d choose a day that isn’t too windy. 

Set the cruise control whenever you can to hold speed. 

Then fill it again exactly to the first click and divide the number on your trip odometer by exactly how much gas you had to put in. Ideally you’d repeat this a couple times but once should be enough to get a good reading. 

If you’re seeing something even close to the EPA highway mileage estimate after doing this all is fine. And whatever fuel consumption variation you’re noticing is down to driving conditions and your own right foot. 


The dashboard  gauges are basically guesswork estimates.  You have to get the real number."

My partner’s 2016 Corolla had been sitting for a little while (stopped driving due to health stuff) but had no major mechanical issues going on (or smells). Getting ready to sell it, I jumped it and drove it around for a few days, cleaned it up, it was running just fine. I took it in for inspection, got some basic brake work done as well as a new battery and oil change. It was all good when I drove it home but next time I started it, I noticed the sulfur/rotten egg smell INSIDE the car which progressively got worse, though I only drove it a few miles since getting the work done. 

So I brought it back into the shop, noting to the guys that I thought it may have to do with the new battery or new oil filter. I assumed it would be an obvious and easy fix, but they told me they found no problems and quoted me $100 for a cabin air filter replacement.

I picked the car up, replaced the cabin filter myself and had the battery tested at autozone. Would that have even picked up a defective battery? How could I tell if the battery is in a condition that would cause the smell? 

Another shop I talked to were also dumbfounded about the smell and seemed focused on the catalytic converter. Obviously that’s not a repair I want to pay for, but I also just think with the distinct timing, it’s most likely the battery, right? The car was sitting rarely driven for a little while, I know that can wear on parts like the cat converter, but I drove the car without any smell for a few days with the jumped battery and it was fine, before going into the shop.

I'm pretty familiar with Audi/VW and they will revise parts every year even when the car is out of production.  They will then switch the part completely for the next generation and start the cycle all over again.  Your car might end up with a good part at the end of the revisions or just a slightly more reliable part than the original.  This just doesn't happen with parts that a prone to fail though, it happens all over.  You come to a revision on a part and ask why the hell did they need to change it.

I have a mk7 VW Golf 1.8T close to 150,000 km. The AC is having trouble maintaining interior temperature when ambient temperature is above 35 Celsius or 95F. Below this threshold, the AC can eventually make the cabin quite cold.

Vents blow strongly, cabin air filter less than a year old and relatively clean, and refrigerant pressure is within normal range.

I took some pics of what I think is the condenser. Does it look like it could be damaged or worned enough to be the problem?

1m9abc4,General advice for what you guys would do in my situation.,"I think I just need some suggestions if that's okay. I currently have a 2017 Hyundai i30 that needs a new turbo charger. The hyundai garage quoted me £2,700 all in all. I can't afford it nor can I justify it. The car is on finance for £219 a month, and I'm still paying £250 instalments monthly for a new ABS it needed 4 months ago.

I have a garage willing to order in a Garrat turbocharger used for Kia and Hyundai cars, with the same model number matching my one. This garage is the only one who will touch it, and seem confident in doing so despite never having fitted a turbo on my make and model hyundai before. 

The hyundai engineer at the hyundai garage mentioned that there's no reason why a local garage couldn't do the job, which is why I've chosen this option as I'm saving about £1.500. 

The only concern I have is if the guy can do it perfectly, as I understand this kind of operation is really hard to do for my car and needs to be tuned perfectly to everything else. They say they have the machine to do it but I genuinely don't feel like they know what to expect here. 

The car is a curse honestly and I'm really depressed atm. I just want a car that makes me happy. Something nice, reliable, and to treat myself to something fancy like an older model C class Mercedes or something. 

I know it sounds stupid and I should just get something reliable like a skoda or something, but I'm almost 30 and just want to treat myself a little. I'd be willing to get whatever car on finance for around 250-300pm. 

I don't know much about cars at all, and I don't really have a father figure or anything to help me make the ""right"" choice if there is one. Guess I'm looking for suggestions on what you guys would do in this situation?

Depending on where you are at in the lifecycle of the finance deal - you might be in trouble.

Please be aware that if you do not get the car fixed, you are massively reducing the market rate. This in turn runs the risk of negative equity on your finance arrangement. Theoretically you could hand the car back in early and still be paying out on it because you returned a car which didn't pay off the remainder of the finance.

Finance company may allow you to do this and they will extend outwards a payment period to cover a new car. However this now means you are in long term servitude to a finance payment.

This can be a very nasty cycle for someone to be caught out in.

Get the numbers right.

Establish the ""working order"" market value of your car.  
Establish the ""not fixed"" market value of your car.  
Establish the outstanding finance.  
Look at the gap.  
Compare it to the repair charge.  
Make a call about whether or not you can pull this off.

I'd also consider a call to your finance company explaining the situation and seeing what they can offer.

You only have 1 immediate choice to make  
\- fix it or don't

My personal advice would be this.

Take the hit, get the car fixed. Ride it out for a while and start saving up money and building a credit rating. If you can reach the end of your finance terms, get a nicer car that's newer and under manufacturer warranty so you don't have to deal with shit again. Put a larger deposit down. Get a bank loan if you can get a competitive APR. Even if you don't want to do the loan, it's still good to show up with a quote that forces the dealership to compete for your money.

An old C Class is a cool idea, but you could easily find yourself in this scenario again. Some shit goes wrong, it costs a lot to repair and one problem reveals another.

The thing that people don't warn you about with car ownership is that you need to be able to accept liability for losing the entire value of the car should things go mechnically wrong. Warranties on more expensive cars are a really good means to protect yourself a bit from the financial strain of unexpected multiple thousand pound bills.

As far trusting the garage goes. Look, you need to do your homework. There will always be bad reviews on google - it's just the law. But try see the overall flow of reviews. At a certain point I don't think you will be able to do anything other than make a decision based on how your spreadsheets look.

If you need to go down the cut your losses route. Make sure you understand the consequences fully and are okay with it. This shit happened to my friend recently. He's demolished 50% of the value of his car on hand in due to a fucked turbo. 

He's now riding around in a beater car that is honestly 1 failure away from the grave while he rides out the final year of his finance.

Not congested enough though to the point a car like this can’t be enjoyed, or at least not at the times I would drive it at, as I work very early mornings or late at night. 

I’ve been told to get a cheap runaround but I don’t really get the point, maybe I’m painfully naive. I don’t want to buy a car as a runaround, I have access to my parents’ car and while it can be annoying to share this is really all I need if I’m not buying to enjoy. For me I see it 2 ways, I stay in the car I’m in, which is cheap and reliable (for now) or I get a new car which wouldn’t be cheap but would give me freedom to go wherever and own my own car. It’s mostly ‘for fun’ but also this car has practical use from what I can see, a boot that is big enough for anything I’d need to carry, has 5 seats so I can bundle my whole family in (not children, I mean parents/ siblings). 

A big selling point for me also is the technology, I know this isn’t the only car out there with a built in sat nav, reversing camera or any of the other assists. But if I’m to buy any car I want at the very least a reversing camera and sat nav, purely because I’d rather have them than not have them. I can drive and park perfectly fine, but they’re assists I want to look for in a new car. I’m aware there are cheap runarounds even with this tech in, but I’m back to spending what I’d still consider a lot of money on something I ultimately don’t want. 

Insurance will definitely be costly, I reckon for the first 2 years at least, maybe looking at £200 cheapest and £300 on the higher side, monthly that is of course. This is doable for me, I am paid well for what I do, live at home and pay minimal rent. My essential outgoings as of currently are around £350, £100 of which is my current car insurance. Even in a bad month of work I’d be left with excess £1000 after the car payment, insurance and rent. I’m not sure how would fuel would cost to be totally honest, but even setting aside £200 (not sure if that’s conservative or not enough at all) still leaves me with a good 800+ every month. 

So, I think financially I can make it happen, but the big question is, is it really worth it? I’m not very experienced in all this, so I’d appreciate insight, are there costs I’ve completely missed and will be a wet slap in the face? Is a new Mercedes reliable enough that I don’t need to worry about mechanical costs for at least a year (providing I don’t drive crazy, which I won’t, I want it to last)? Also, is anyone aware of how often, if at all, Mercedes run these sorts of discounts? I’ve never been in the market for a new car so I’m unsure, as this could also sway my decision to hold out until next year with a lot more saved or going for a higher spec/ model. 

Just like to say thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this and give any help/ advice/ opinions. If more info is needed for anything I’m sure I can provide! I’m happy to hear answers I probably don’t want to hear, ultimately I just don’t want to ruin myself financially and end up with a dud. Thank you all!

You need to remember that for some people, a car is literally nothing more than transport. It's an appliance to get from A to B.

For others, cars are a hobby, and they might spend way more money on them then ever makes sense as transport.

And it's a spectrum, of varying priorities and financial situations.

Some folk will spend 20k on a car, then look back and think ""that was a waste I should have spent 5k on a jalopy"". Others will spend 20k and be delighted with the experience.

This subreddit oddly enough seems to be full of folks for whom a car is mostly just transport. And thus the general outlook is buying a cheap old jalopy with cash and finance nothing. Which is unlike most typical car groups, which are often full of the more enthusiast types.

It’s more reliable, cheap on insurance, and looks decent. VAG cars are okay but I’ve heard that they have costly repairs, can be unreliable and are money pits (I think the water pump breaks often or something), but they have the best looking cars imo. 

As others have said the eco boom issue is popular and it’s not worth the risk, which is why the price of the car is so cheap compared to its competitors. 

I think I heard that they fixed in 2018 they fixed the issue, but I wouldn’t really trust it as Ford has a crap reputation for reliability. Also fiestas are generally high on insurance but it depends on the specific engine and generation, so just do an insurance quote for free with fake details on a burner email address & vpn & new browser.

The panoramic roof had the usual VAG gutter issue where it pisses water in through the A pillar (affects Skoda, Audi, VW, Porsche and Seat Pano roofs) and they cancelled the order and refunded me all the money. 

I contacted the DVLA who asked me to send across the details from Cinch as the car was never delivered, and whilst it took a while, I seem to remember they just refunded me in full.

You haven't mentioned anywhere about needing an automatic, so if you can both drive manual that would be a much better option. There are plenty of reliable Japanese/Korean cars that would suit your needs within a £3500 budget. The 2005-11 Honda Civic has a great reliability record and they're nice enough to drive. Another option would be the 2007-12 KIA Cee'd or its very similar sister, the Hyundai i30. If you don't need a C-segment car, I'd look at a 2008-12 Fiesta with the 1.4 or 1.6 petrol engines (or even the 1.25 if you don't do many miles). They are good to drive, and the engines are reliable. As well as the ever reliable second generation Toyota Yaris in this category, I'd also consider a Suzuki Swift.
