1ol9d7q,1966 Buick Skylark GS Rough Idle (Most Likely Flooded Carb Aftermath?),"Hi all,

I'm finally getting around to putting some attention to my Skylark. I'm trying to drive it at least once a week to keep the moving parts lubricated, and well, but I must admit, there have been times when it's sat for over a month – possibly up to two months.

**Some history of it...**

\- I had the engine rebuilt in Jan 2019; we learned that it wasn't the first rebuild, and the bores were maxed out to begin with, so some blowby remains.

\- We replaced the 2-barrel carb with a 4-barrel Holley Street Warrior 4160 alongside the rebuild in 2019.

\- I've only had 3k miles on it since the rebuild.

\- Had the shop do a check up in Jan 2025 and they saw a leak in the coolant line and replaced it + oil change

**The latest problem...**

\- I noticed the coolant reservoir tank was bubbling after a drive. The reservoir tank was due to be replaced, so I replaced it and burped the system earlier this week. (10/26/25)

\- Today, (10/31/25) I park in an underground structure. Upon leaving the structure, up the steep driveway, I felt the engine wanting to stall, but I gave it some gas and was able to make up OK, and the car drove smoothly.

\- I filled the gas tank as I was running errands. No problems until coming back home.

\- I felt the engine sputtering as I was going down the driveway, but couldn't quite give it gas since my foot was on the brake to not run into the garage gate.

\- It stalled, and I smelled and saw gas around the carburetor after removing the air filter. Pretty certain it was a flooded engine caused by the descent of the driveway and possible full gas tank(?).

\- I pushed it near my parking spot, but still needed to back in. I was able get the engine to start after waiting 20 min, pressing the gas before cranking, cranking 20+ seconds.

\- The idle was rough when I was moving it and some black smoke appeared in the right exhaust.

\- I'm assuming the mixture was still rich because it would stutter and sometimes stall when I was backing it in.

\- I won't be able to look at it until Sunday or next week. ***My wishful thinking is that the excess gas will evaporate by then and resolve itself?*** But I definitely want to be proactive with what's going on with my car.

\- I've never had a problem with going up/down hills. ***Do you think my carburetor needs adjusting? Or should I troubleshoot other things?***

*-* If it is the carburetor needing adjustments...any recommendations for a mobile mechanic near Pasadena, CA? I don't really want to tinker with something I'm not familiar with and I don't want to chance it up the driveway if I could.

The video attached shows my car settling in its parking spot.

Thanks!

I am able to start the engine while it’s hooked up to the charger and disconnected but will not restart after it’s turned off. After charging though, I’ve noticed that the battery doesn’t hold the charge nor does it trip the “bad battery” light on my charger.

It’s a second hand vehicle where the owner claims the alternator is newish and the battery is 2 years old. It’s a 2000 XLE Camry v6. I’ve had the vehicle for about 2 months already and it hasn’t had issues starting. I have found a rat/mouse “nest” where it has acorn caps and some droppings on top of the transmission.

From what I can see without disassembling, all the wires look intact though unsure if they can squeeze underneath. I have also seen this acid has been spurted from the battery.

Quick backstory: I drive a 2012 Jeep Wrangler Sport that had its engine fully replaced with a rebuild in February 2024 by a local mechanic. In July of this year, I noticed a burning smell, some white smoke from under the hood, & an oil leak under the car so I brought it back in to this same mechanic & was told one of the valve cover gaskets was cracked (on the engine I JUST got replaced). They said it was the rebuild company's fault. They replaced the gasket, but 3 days later I bring it back in because I'm still smelling burning & seeing smoke. They found a big plastic chunk of something (they're not sure what) that had fallen into the exhaust & melted a bunch, so they took it out, told me everything else on the engine looked perfect, & sent me on my way. In late August, I'm still smelling burning every so often & white smoke whisps from the hood here & there so I bring it into the Jeep dealership instead of this mechanic; I'm told that this is normal because there is probably residual plastic that still needs to burn off for awhile so I can keep driving on it (they didn't actually check it, they just told me they didn't want to charge me $200 when they're 99% sure this is the case). To this day, I still get a very slight burning smell here & there & white smoke whisps every so often, but have been driving along thinking we're all good & it's just the plastic still burning off. 

Today I notice that there is oil dripping out of the bottom of my car (just over 3 months after getting a new valve cover gasket), crawl under, & see that there is oil on the bottom of the oil pan. I'm bringing it into service center first thing Tuesday morning (quicket appointment I could get), but in the meantime, is this safe to drive? Has my engine possibly been taking a ton of damage because I've been driving it thinking everything's okay? Did I get scammed by this local mechanic? Help! (Picture attached)

Thinks that could go wrong. You could have connected something wrong to the inverter. Inverter could fail (unlikely for actual factory one). Exhaust could get blocked by ice if it's extremely cold. Check if this happening after maybe 4 hours of idling in extremely cold, just moving the car a bit would fix it. Exhaust gas could choke you or the car if it's in a closed garage/area.

If you think this is something that you actually may need to test for an hour. Best for testing this (and later when using it in a real situation) is to start it fully warmed-up car and turn the blower speed to minimum and the temperature to the smallest temperature (not min) (it's 16c but not sure about F) and blower set something other than windshield. If it then works for an hour it will work until the fuel runs out. And that should be at least 48 with maybe half a tank. So make sure you have that or a way to add fuel. Actual time depends on how much power your using from inverter and how cold it is."

No power to the relay on the starter when turning key to start - the wire to the fusebox hasn't corroded either and I've checked the resistance through the wire - 0 ohms

Starter works fine as I tried to run the starter relay seperately with a wire to battery +. The car still won't start whilst cycling the key on/off. Engine turns fine.

Replaced ground wire from gearbox to chassis

Checked power to ECU - everything seems to be good

Replaced the fusebox behind the left headlight with a used one - still the same.

Checked the resistance on the immobilizer ring/antenna for the key - 15 ohms

Checked for broken wires over the gearbox - nothing is broken/corroded and I've done a tug test on the wires

For a better idea. Ask a state patrol DOT Officer what he thinks.

You are taking your lives and other peoples lives in your hand if you drive that truck.

Air brakes have spring chambers.  Those will not stop a fire truck during emergency braking.  


The air brakes on the trash truck at my apt building used to release air every 30 seconds instead of every few minutes. I warned the drivers they were going to fail. Much like you the shop would not service them. I called the company. Talked to the forman. They all do that. 

A month later. I hear the truck not releasing air.  I go out. Its a brand new truck.  I say nice truck. What happened to the old one.

1okynxu,Question about completely dead car battery (left with lights on for two days),"Hi, Hopefully someone can point me in the right direction. I've got a 2023 Kia Stonic that has done about 15k miles.

I had to leave my car at work overnight (45 minute drive away) because I had a migraine so my wife picked me up. Turns out that when I locked up the car I left the lights on and in that time the battery has completely run flat.

We went to pick it up, found it wouldn't start, borrowed some jumper cables but it wouldn't start.

What did happen was:
- Car alarm activated (and stopped when using the key fob)
- lights, radio, wipers, heating system all started up
- when I turned the ignition it made a single click, and restarted the electronics systems, but no classic struggling to start or continuous clicking I remember from old cars as a kid.

The last time I did this was 20+ years ago, so no idea if I'm doing it right for a modern car, but the rest of the electronics immediately coming to life and the age of the car leads me to assume it's unlikely to be a coincidental system failure at the same time I left the lights on.

So I guess my main questions. Should I be attaching the cables and leavinging them a certain amount of time to partially charge the battery?

Final question - our other car is an EV so I'm assuming that you can jump start a car using an EV? Seems like a stupid question but we've not had cars older than 3 years old for 10 years now, so very out of practice",1,1761926824.0,5,MechanicAdvice,1762025504,2025-10-31 16:07:04,2025-11-01 19:31:44,"Sophias_dad (Score: 1): First answer is yes, leave the cables connected for a while before trying to start, if the battery is that dead.

Second answer is probably NO, but it depends on the EV. The 12V battery in an EV is usually tiny, and may not like being asked for lots of power all at once. The components that try to keep the 12V battery charged might either temporarily or permanently stop trying to keep the 12V battery charged.

DropTopGSX (Score: 1): It's not recommended to use an EV/hybrid to jump start other vehicles. It technically can work but you are asking a lot of amps from solid state dc-dc converters that aren't really designed for it and connecting and removing cables can cause voltage spikes.

1okxykd,Engine Misfiring,"Engine has been misfiring for a few months now, but still haven't narrowed down the cause. Hoping my attempt at a description helps because after seeing 2 mechanics, they haven't figured it out:

2009 Hyundai Santa Fe, 8th character on VIN is E, a little over 160k miles. Check engine light will turn on steady, and I'll feel very subtle misfiring when I'm idle. I can drive for 5 - 15 miles before the light begins flashing, and the car starts to jerk and shake, not accelerating properly. When I turn the car off and back on, it goes back to the mild misfiring and a steady check engine light for another 5 - 15 miles before the light shuts back off and drives normally. It happens sporadically, sometimes I can go days without the light coming on, sometimes a week or two. Misfiring seems more apparent when I accelerate slowly, and has ramped into the major misfire when I reach 40mph on city roads. Both mechanics that I've seen have confirmed that my spark plugs are in good condition.

Is anyone able to narrow down the issue based on my description? Been dealing with this for months and I'm at my wits' end.

I was able to verify a leaking water pump and the front plastic y-pipe leaking pretty heavily at the base where it enters the engine.

That being said, the parts cost isn't much, I can fix it myself, and get a discount from seller. But before I threw money into and agreed to keep vehicle (7 day return policy), I wanted to verify the engine and head gasket health to make sure that the previous owner didn't overheat the engine or was constantly driving it with low coolant.

I first used an engine combustion leak detector in the overflow bottle. The fluid stayed the exact same color blue with no indication of contamination or gasses entering. Knowing how expensive this engine is, I took it a step further and did an engine leak down test just to be certain. The results were only 1-2% leak down on every cylinder which sounds too good to be true for this motor, hence why I'm asking if what I did was correct.

- Got the engine up to operating temperature
- Removed all 8 spark plugs
- Removed coolant overflow cap and oil fill cap
- Inserted hose into cylinder # 1 and connected to tester
- Hooked up shop air to tester and and turned regulator until it showed 10 psi on first dial
- Found TDC by manually rotating crank until the second dial would match the first dial at 10 psi
- Slowly turned up the pressure to 100 psi
- As pressure was increased, I had to hold the crank bolt with a long 3' breaker bar to keep the crank from rotating backwards as it progressed to 100psi
- At 100 psi, there's a lot force/pressure and I really had to hold the bar/crank steady

Had to have right side replaced again due to squeaking, pulled teeth to have left replaced due to thunking/clunking. Still having left-sided noise. **What could it be & would it be reasonable to ask for a discount if it's related to the suspension since it started after their work?**

*WARNING: LONG POST*

I have a 2011 Honda Accord. I took it to this one shop to have it inspected and to check the A/C for leaks. The shop owner suggested I replace the rear shocks/struts because they had a bit more give on them with manual manipulation. I do a lot of driving and I couldn't say for certain but they more than likely were original to the vehicle. There was no noise or fear of flying when driving on them but better safe than sorry, right?

They replaced both. That's when the problems started. 

First, the right side had this awful squeaking noise that sounded like plastic on plastic. They warrantied that one & replaced it. Beautiful silence from that side, except for the fact that they knocked the brake bulb in the back window loose that caused it to rattle. Had them fix that too, much to their chagrin.

Now, about two weeks since the squeaking has stopped, I've been dealing with a thunking/clunking coming from the left side. I removed everything from my trunk & drove around for the last month and a half to see if it would go away. **Surprise. It did not.** I bring it back to them & their CEO was in the shop (didn't know he was the CEO at the time). He offered to ride in my car while I drove. He says he feels/ hears the movement while he's sitting in the backseat.

He instructs the technicians to replace both assemblies again, which I'm apprehensive of because the right finally stopped making noise. I had to call the technicians because 6hrs had gone by & I didn't hear anything from them. They claimed the noise I heard was the plastic cover in the back window, saying they ran over the car with a fine-tooth comb. I called the CEO to ask him if he could talk to them again because maybe I'm not using the right words. 

CEO gets there, the technicians replace the left assembly, and I was told it would be done by morning. CEO also claims that my spare was loose so they tightened it for me in the trunk. I had to call them in the afternoon the next day since nobody contacted me. They claim they're running one final test drive & that it should be ready by 3pm. They don't call me so I just go about my work day & pick it up from their shop after I'm done with work. 

**It's. Still. Doing. It.**

I decide to prove a point & pull out my entire backseat, plastic cover, and everything from the trunk including the spare, which they tightened down so much I had to have my boyfriend use pliers to loosen it. Recorded two videos & asked the CEO for any suggestions. He claims he doesn't hear anything in the videos. Um...?

The reason it's so expensive could be that your connecting pipe that comes before the muffler is also damaged and might need to be repaired or replaced. In either case, you should be able to do it yourself for very cheap, if you're willing and able.

1oktsqg,Buying an engine from Power Engines for 1/3 the cost,"My 2019 Kia Optima EX 1.6l turbo needs a new engine due to burning oil. It has 163,000 miles. I like the car and would love to keep driving it for many more miles. I have a few different options when it comes to new engines and I need help deciding.

All three options would be installed by a pro mechanic at a local shop for about $2100 in labor which will be the same for all engines.

1. My mechanic quoted me $6,900 for a remanufactured engine (part only). This comes with a 3 year / 100,000 mile warranty. If there is anything wrong with the engine I bring it back to the mechanic and he coordinates with the manufacturer to get it fixed, 0 cost to me. I think they even to rental coverage if that would happen.

2.[ Patriot Engines](https://www.patriotengines.com/remanufactured-kia-engines): I found these guys online and they say they specialize in reman engines for cars like mine. The price is $4900 with a 3 year / 100,000 mile warranty. Their warranty has very rigid requirements for installation, break in procedures, and oil change intervals that can void the warranty easily if not followed. They only cover $50/hour in labor if something breaks on the engine and I would have to coordinate between the mechanic and them if a claim needed to be files which I could see getting messy. They seem to have good reviews on Google and BBB, but also my mechanic has never heard of them.

3. [Power Engines](https://powerengines.com/products/2016-2020-kia-optima-1-6l-turbo-g4fj-gamma-ii-t-gdi-4-cylinder-engine-motor?variant=48307916013880): Also found this engine online at a very low price of $2300. Apparently it's a ~~remanufactured~~ brand new engine. Comes with a 6 month warranty and no labor coverage. Can find very little information about them online but their google and TrustPilot reviews seem pretty positive overall.

I am not opposed to a shorter warranty as long as a get a quality product. I know it will be installed by a pro either way which should help avoid some common issues. My goals is to have a reliable commute to work and occasional weekend trip car. My wife has another car for the family so this is not my only transportation but I want it to be reliable.

Your English is good enough but when you say candles you mean sparkplugs. Candles in English are the wax things with a wick you light on fire. 


I cant figure out what you mean by ""the calculator looks new"" though. It is important to remember just because a part is new doesnt mean its good. 

RudbeckiaIS (Score: 2): What do you mean by ""ignition coils""? These engines have a distributor (distributeur d'allumage) not the ignition coils (bobines d'allumage) used by present engines. Are you sure you did not replace the spark plug caps (bouchons de les bougies d'allumage) alone? 

Generally speaking these FIRE engines lose spark because the pulse sensor (impulseur) in the distributor wears out or just shorts out. It can be replaced (the part is about €30) but given a fully assembled brand new Marelli distributor (exactly the same as the original, two year warranty) is around €100 it usually makes more sense to just replace the distributor as an assembly or to buy a full Marelli overhaul kit (about €60).

1okqrvn,2010 Honda Civic LX Coupe (191k mi) — Fair repair prices or too high? What can safely wait?,"Hey all,

This is my **father’s 2010 Civic LX Coupe** (191k miles, automatic). I handle maintenance for him. He’s a senior and doesn’t drive much anymore, so the car mostly sits in our apartment garage. I take it on the freeway **once every week or two** to keep the battery charged and the fluids circulating.

The shop I usually go to in SoCal recently did a safety inspection and gave me this estimate:

* Brake fluid flush (fluid is green) – **$156**
* Rear brake shoes + drums (“lip” on drum) – **$594**
* Drive belt – **$191**
* Lower control arms + alignment – **$720**
* Rear shocks (blown) – **$503**
* Front drive axles (both) – **$957**
* 1 TPMS sensor – **$125**

I already replaced all 4 t1res which fixed the 70+ mph steering wheel shake. The car drives smoother now, but the brake pedal still feels a bit soft. The rep said to do the **brake flush + rear shoes/drums + belt first** (about $1,000 total).

Right now I’ve only got **$420 saved**, so I’m trying to figure out what’s urgent versus what can safely wait about 6 months.

# Some extra info:

* Rear shocks supposedly “blown,” but the car doesn’t bounce or feel unstable.
* Transmission was flushed **Feb 2023 (Jiffy Lube)** per Carfax. It used to shift jerky, but feels smoother now after replacing all 4 t1res.
* A/C doesn’t work — my brother (previous owner) said it needs a compressor (\~$1k), but I’ve read that 8th-gen Civics sometimes just need new **A/C fuses** and a refrigerant recharge.
* When I turn on the cabin fan, I smell **exhaust**, so I usually keep it off.

# Questions:

1. Do these prices look **fair for Southern California** (Torrance area)?
2. Can I safely **delay** the brake flush + rear brake job + drive belt for a few months if it’s mostly used for short local drives?
3. Should I redo the **trans fluid change** soon or wait, since it was done in 2023?
4. Any advice on **DIY A/C fuse + recharge** vs. paying a shop for diagnosis?
5. With \~$400 to spend now, what would *you* prioritize for safety and reliability?

Not in a rush to sell nor planning to anytime soon — just trying to keep the car safe and reliable for my dad on a budget. Thanks in advance for any advice from mechanics or Civic owners!

When I checked, the coolant level was very low, and when I carefully opened the reservoir, it hissed and bubbled up. I topped it up with water, and that seemed to fix the problem temporarily.

I can’t see where the leak is coming from, but my mechanic friend said it’s likely a coolant leak.

Has anyone had this happen before right after a service?
Is it reasonable to expect the garage to check and fix it for free?
Any advice on how to approach them would be really appreciated.",1,1761905733.0,3,MechanicAdvice,1762025504,2025-10-31 10:15:33,2025-11-01 19:31:44,"Chippy569 (Score: 3): Define ""full service""

1okqb5s,Broken Cv axle,"Hey guys. So a few weeks ago I had a mechanic replace my wheel hub assembly and then he claimed my axle was also bad but told me it was safe to drive until the new part came in for him to replace. I got about a mile down from my house, whole vehicle vibrating and when I went to turn around to come back home, the axle broke and I lost driving/reverse and now park. The actual axle did come apart, he jimmy rigged it and cut the end where the cotter pin goes through to secure it to the wheel. So I’m wondering if that caused it and he broke it because he didn’t support it properly while replacing my wheel hub assembly. I hired someone else and they couldn’t get the axle out. They think tranny is toast and the axle is seized in it, maybe broken apart in there. Recommending I take to a shop and have them drop the tranny to take apart and pull the axle out. The end of the axle that sits in the boot/wheel hub is what came apart .
Basically what I’m asking is, is my tranny messed up or should I keep trying to get the axle out ? Cost of the tranny is more than the vehicle is worth if that needs replacing too,I can’t afford that but this vehicle is almost paid off and I really can’t afford another vehicle either.

1oklb4i,2010 Ford Mustang 4.0L V6 | Loud Whining Noise on Cold Start (Disappears when the engine warms up),"1. 🚗 Vehicle Details
• Year, Make, Model: 2010 Ford Mustang V6
• Engine: 4.0L V6
• Transmission: Automatic
• Mileage: 183000
• Recent Work: replaced the Serpentine belt, tensioner pulley, steering pump, steering fluid reservoir

2. 🔊 The Issue: Cold Start Whine
My 2010 V6 Mustang makes a very loud, high-pitched whining/hauling noise only when the engine is cold. The severity of the noise is highly dependent on the outside temperature; it is significantly louder in cold weather and completely absent in the summer.
The noise lasts for about 10-15 minutes total until the engine reaches operating temperature.

3. ⏱️ Noise Behavior Details
The whining goes through two distinct phases:
• Phase 1 (First few minutes): The whine is constant, even at idle in Neutral or Park, without touching the gas pedal. It sounds very loud right after a cold start.
• Phase 2 (After a few minutes): The constant whine fades away, but the noise can still be heard. It only occurs under acceleration (whether driving or revving in neutral).
• The Fade: As the car continues to warm up (usually around the 10-15 minute mark), the sound gets lower and lower until it is completely gone.",1,1761884748.0,6,MechanicAdvice,1762025504,2025-10-31 04:25:48,2025-11-01 19:31:44,"Low-Post-1843 (Score: 1): My frontier does this, it sounds like sleigh bells on startup.

1okkhxt,BMW N52 Engine slowly loosing coolant but no visible leak. What to do??,"So I have a 2005 E87 130i with the n52 engine.

The car has around 220k kilometers on the clock (\~136k miles).

I've been dealing with a minor coolant leak for the past few months.

This started back in January 2025 where I got a low coolant warning when starting the car and I found a lot of coolant in the engine under tray upon inspection. I immediately topped it off with coolant and replaced the expansion tank which was likely the problem as the car didn't lose coolant for 6 months.

6 months later, the car started slowly loosing coolant again.  
The coolant level goes from MAX to MIN every \~500 kilometers (300 miles) before I top it off. That's approximately one top off every 45 days.

The problem is that every time I take it for a drive I cannot find any visible leaks or dried drips afterwards.

I took it to a mechanic yesterday and he performed a pressure test for about 5 minutes and there were no leaks on the front side of the engine. He suspects a leak from the rear end of the engine but isn't sure where it could come from.

I am therefore writing seeking advice/help here regarding the matter. Is there a way to find the source of the leak or should I wait for it to get worse so that I can pinpoint the source of the leak in an easier way? (The latter is probably a bad idea).

I doubt that coolant is mixing with oil because the coolant is pure and doesn't look like it has an oil contamination. There's no white smoke coming from the exhaust either.

Bring it to a local mechanic.

6d8Camaro (Score: 1): Agree with OK\_Analysis\_8116. This is difficult to diagnose. I will offer that you need to look at some of the basics.

Check the battery cables to ensure they are not lose. Try to wiggle each cable where the cable is connected to the battery. If the connection moves, the cable needs to be tightened. Make sure there is no white looking powder on the connections; this is corrosion. If so, the cable connection needs to be removed and cleaned. There is battery terminal grease at the parts store. It's a little packet of goo that you spread on the cable connection and battery connection area. 

Ground cables are common to cause havoc becuase over the years of driving these cables can loosen and or corrode causing issues. You would need to research where the ground cables are for this vehicle then find them under the hood. 

Check that you are no loosing excessive antifreeze causing an overheating issue. When you drive does the water temp gauge show a reading in the red, very high, or a high number like 240 or higher? If so, the engine may have a external or internal antifreeze leak causing the overheating issue. Internal leak would be antifreeze getting into the engine combustion chamber or oil crankcase.

Another common issue is ""heat soaking"" where the battery cables or wiring get excessively hot causing excessive resistance, which won't permit the starter to engage. If the red battery cable that goes to the starter has breaks in the red outter covering, or like the battery connections above, has loose or corrosion at the starter, then you will experience issues. When I work on older cars, I usually replace both the battery cables with a larger gauge cable, which commonly alleviates some ""ghosts in the system"".

1ol2gr4,Advice needed about winter car storage in an uninsulated garage.,"Hello all! I've had my rust free Integra for just over a year now and I'm about to experience my second winter with it which means it's time to store it again for the season. 

Last year I had the car under a cover made specifically for the car and stored in a non insulated or heated garage as unfortunately it's my only option for storage. When late April came around and I took the cover off the car for the first time in 6 months I noticed the car was wet. Not soaking but definitely wet with some sort of condensation droplets all over the car. This concerned me as I figure if this condensation had occurred the whole 6 months it was in storage from temperature fluctuations there's probably water condensation inside the frame which could lead it to begin oxidizing. 

I'm wondering how I can store my car in a more proper way to prevent this kind of water buildup around the car and prevent anything that could lead it to rust. Unfortunately I'm not able to have a dehumidifier in the garage either. The car has been rust proofed every year and I'll be going to get that done again in a few days. Is the cover trapping too much moisture within it? Is it better to just leave it in the garage with no cover? My worry with not having a cover on it is salt from dirty snow shovels and salt bags that will be stored in the garage just a couple feet away from the car (it's a small single car garage that barely fits the Integra). 

My car is mint and rust free and I REALLY want to keep it that way. Any and all advice about proper storage of my car would be greatly appreciated!

Insulation isn't just for warmth. It also keeps cool air in when it's hot outside. Likely, at some point during the winter storage, the sun beating down on the garage causes the whole garage to warm up and the moisture on/around your car has nowhere to escape to with the cover blocking it's escape route. 

I have a garage with one insulated bay and two non-insulated. I store my GMC Jimmy in one of the non bays with a collection of moving blankets draped all over it: keeps the dust off, provides a bit of cushion/protection, and doesn't retain moisture. 

In the summertime, it gets hot as hell in the bay with the lower roof line. The other one has 16' ceilings and is ventilated which keeps it cool at ground level.

Universal **does not exist** for ""naked"" roof cars. Yakima and Thule have vehicle specific fit kits for their systems to give a near custom fit and to keep the rack secure and water out. Are they more expensive? Yes. Why? Because they take time to get their hands on every vehicle and do a test fits before anything hits their fit guide.

Here's a little back story of how Safelite caused my windshield wiper speed control to break.

Recently I had a rock hit and crack my windshield which quickly spread across half of my windshield. I called my auto insurance and started my claim for windshield replacement. My appointment was with Safelite and I had to drive to their shop because my electronics would have to be recalibrated after the replacement.

After they replaced my windshield and recalibrated the sensors and such, I noticed that my automatic rain sensing feature was not working. *(Luckily it rained a couple days after I had the work done so I was able to notice this and go back within their 30 days warranty period to have it fixed.)* The tech said that the ""pad wasn't touching the glass"". So he fixed it and now the auto rain sensing feature works. Great.

**However, now the interval control twist knob is not responsive. I can flip entire lever up and down to go between low and high speeds and that does work. But the twist knob to fine tune the speed within high or low does not work. How can I fix this?**

1okl9ij,Fed up with modern car industry -- anyone else agree?,"I just don't like what has been going on in the last 15 or so years. Nothing built since the mid 2000's appeals to me. Everything is over-styled, over complicated, stuffed with crazy amounts of tech under the hood or in the cabin, etc.

I hate touchscreens and now they are everywhere. Nothing wrong with buttons and dials. High quality switch-gear is so much more satisfying to use. Besides, who wants to stare at nasty fingerprints all over their screens? Also, rotary dials to navigate screens is a pain while driving, the stupid mouse controller Lexus had in 2010 was awful, screen commands suck.

I hate big wagon wheels. A 20 inch wheel on a Camry? Looks awful. I think big FAT tires look 100x better. Not to mention you get a much, much smoother ride.

I hate modern day suspensions. They are tuned for handling so people can whip around corners as fast as possible and turn in quick 1/4 mile times. So what? How dumb. Cars used to be so comfortable going down the road. Now you feel every pebble thanks to rubber-band, 35-series sidewall tires and suspensions tuned for more stupid road feel.

I hate the tiny bunker windows in vehicles these days. Looks awful. Bring me back to the days of big square windows and low belt lines so you can actually get a good view around everything. You also can't see out the back of the window in modern sedans because of the sloped roof. Garbage.

I hate the atrocious, big giant in-your-face grilles. Lexus with the spindle grille and BMW with the butt-cheek grille are the two worst grille designs in auto history. Period. Why can't auto makers have conservative designs that are easy to look at?

I hate all the crazy tech under the hood these days. Thinking about a modern car is scary: a turbo 4 or 6 with cylinder deactivation, direct injection, auto start/stop, and 9-10 speed transmissions. Yuck. Talk about a disaster once the thing is out of warranty. No chance that would last nearly, nearly as long as a N/A 6 or 8 with a basic 5-speed auto. Not without shelling out major $$$$$. I don't care that a 2024 RX350 with the turbo 4 has more power than the ones with the V6. It sounds way worse for one and two, it's not like the older ones with the 2GR were dogs. You put a 4-cylinder in a 4500 lb pig it's not going to last nearly as long and it sounds awful. Not nearly as smooth but that extra 1 mpg savings is worth it right??

I hate modern interiors. Manufacturers use the lightest, cheapest garbage they can get ahold of. I guess they have to save money for big giant screens, sensors, cameras, mood lighting, all that junk. I hate how almost every car now has a big giant gaping hole in the middle of the center console because they couldn't bother to engineer a cover for the cupholders. Terrible and horrible to look at. Minimalist designs are disgusting. They all want to be like Tesla where EVERYTHING is done in a giant screen. Dig through menus, get fingerprints on screens, turn on wipers, turn on AC, find a different song, open glove box. Everything is turning to having to use a touchscreen. Having it mounted on top of the dash is an abomination. This is what luxury is to every car buyer these days. Having the biggest screen. It's like a cock fight. Who has the biggest screen.

Here's something: look at a W223 S-Class. You think it's luxurious having a giant screen for everything in the middle of the dash and nothing else? What about for the gauge cluster? That's not luxury having a tablet for the instrument cluster! No thank you. Bring me back to simple gauges where you didn't have endless garbage to put on these screens. Lexus and BMW from the 90's are my favorite gauge clusters of all time. Simple, easy to look at, all the information you need, no gimmicks.

I hate how everybody is driving pig SUV's these days. You're on the road in a sedan, it's hard to look around them. You're at an intersection and you need them to step on it so you don't miss the light and they take their time. Lazy driving is what I call it. Maneuverability is awful, way worse than a sedan. I can't stand being stuck behind them in town. They all look ugly with slits for windows, overstyled front ends, giant wagon wheels with rubberband tires and ugly plastic cladding around wheels. Guarantee 75% of people driving these awful things could easily get away with a sedan or at least a hatch. Also too many people driving a giant nasty 4-door truck. They wouldn't dare haul anything in the bed because they are show trucks. They couldn't stand the idea of a scratch in the bed even though it's a friggin' truck.

These are just some of the reasons why I hate the modern auto industry. All of these points have built for some time. It was incredibly easy for me to write all this. I didn't have to think about any of this stuff. Took maybe 15 minutes to write all this and that's with me going to get a bottle of water from the fridge.

PrinceParadox (Score: 2): Since its a 2014 Buick LaCrosse, it likely has a broken left rear toe link,  its a critical suspension component that controls the wheel’s alignment angle. The loud pop you heard during a turn was the link snapping under stress, often due to rust weakening the metal, a known issue in 2010–2016 LaCrosse models even though 2014 wasn’t officially recalled.

With the link broken, the rear left wheel swings outward (toed out by about 10°), pulling the car sharply to one side and forcing you to hold the steering wheel at a 45° angle just to go straight.

This is a serious safety issue, I would not drive far until repaired. The fix involves replacing the broken toe link (and ideally the right side too, as it often fails next), followed by a wheel alignment, with total repair costs typically ranging from $300 to $700 at a shop, or around $150 in parts if you DIY.

1okirq2,2016 Nissan Versa - Bad wheel bearing?,"2016 Nissan Versa

I have replaced both front strut assemblies, front sway bar end links, drivers side CV axle, lower control arms, and all three motor/tranny mounts.  Car is still exhibiting some pretty major vibrating and what feels like the wheel binding seemingly on drivers side.  When jacked up on each side, it does not appear that the wheel bearing is shot, as everything spins freely and quietly, even when put in drive or reverse and turning the wheel while jacked up. both front wheels are tight, and have zero play at all.

  
I am lost with this one, but thinking the last possible thing to try would be a wheel hub.  Unless this could possibly be the end of the transmission, but it does not appear to be slipping or acting up at all.  Noise gets louder with speed, and is not related to brakes at all.

Also, I wouldn't trust those cheap refrigerant cans to do diagnose pressure in the system.

However, a few things you can do on your end is checking fuses and the AC relay to ensure it's working. If you have easy access to the AC compressor. You can supply power to it to ensure it engages (with the engine off). AC systems are simple by design, but the gear you need to properly maintain the refrigerant and know how to work on em is a different ballpark and pay grade.

If you have a spare battery that’s good, put it in and see if it still has the issue if it does it’s likely the alternator getting ready to go out completely. To check before you replace anything though try turning on the lights, wipers, radio while it’s running and see if it dies earlier or instantly when turning something else on.

Practice doing this with no gas input. You should feel exactly when the engine starts tugging. If you stall, you went too quickly and let off the clutch too fast. Thread minuscule amounts of gas to the engine once you feel the engine pull, and once the car is moving at all, you can fully release the clutch at crawling speeds. 

This works in reverse as well. The grab point is the same. But realistically, you’re never going to be backing up far enough and hard enough that riding the clutch at all is going to cause noticeable wear. If you absolutely want to know how you can use reverse without riding on your clutch, you have to use the same procedure as I described above.

They estimated a cost of around $350. I signed the documents and left my car with them.

When I came to pick up my car, they informed me the cost was almost $1000. Apparently the $250 cost was for the window replacement, and there was a $600 cost for interior detail.

I asked them why that $600 cost wasn't in the estimate, and they said because they don't know how much the interior work would cost until they did it. I told them I needed to speak with the insurance agent and left without paying and getting my car back.

The insurance agent said that the cost was higher than he was expecting, but nothing seemed out of place (is it really $600 for interior work?) Also, he said that the increase of costs from estimates are to be expected, but it wasn't usual for such an expensive item to be left out of the estimate.

The document for the original estimate is itemized, and has a line for ""clean up broken glass"", but there is no cost estimate for that item, it's just blank.

I live in California, and I have read that California law requires a repair shop to notify the customer for additional costs beyond the estimate. As far as I can tell, this repair shop didn't do that. I wasn't notified beforehand.

last November I had an issue where the low coolant warning light came on in the morning. I topped up the coolant, drove to work, then went to the shop later that day. They checked everything but didn’t find any leaks and just told me to keep an eye on it. I drove the car for a whole year without any problems.

Last Sunday, the same thing happened again — the warning light came on, I added some water, and the car ran fine. On Tuesday I checked the expansion tank and noticed some coolant on the outside of the tank. I thought maybe I had just spilled some when topping it up, so I wiped it clean and kept driving.

Today I checked again, and the tank is wet on the outside in the same area. So it looks like the same issue as last year. What confuses me is that it was perfectly fine for a year, and now, in the fall, it’s happening again. Could weather or temperature changes have something to do with it?

SimpleInterests (Score: 17): Spring clamps provide 'constant' pressure to the area and act almost like a tourniquet.

But keep in mind that these get heat cycled easier than worm gear clamps because there's less metal the heat needs to go through before it becomes completely saturated.

Also keep in mind that, while this isn't a definitive test, Project Farm [did do a test in which a spring clamp was tested and performed the worst among all clamps in terms of leak pressure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtMPq2lG-8U).

The reason I use worm gears is because they hold pressure much better and are less prone to that heat cycle stretch. Yes, they do fail easier if you over-torque, but just... don't over-torque?

At the end of the day, it could come down to preference. I personally hate that I need another tool to properly remove spring clamps, but when you have that tool it does make it feel easier."

Hi there! I have question for anyone who might have had a similar issue with following:

Few months back, an engine check light appeared on my dash. Hooked the car to diagnostics which said P219600 (oxy sensor 1 bank 1 stuck rich). Had the car remapped (OPF off, also physically taken off, stage 1) and it ran fine for some time. Some time later, again the said check light appeared (same code). Fuel economy went down the drain, engine loses power and it shakes way more than it should. I changed sparkplugs (NGK) and ignition coils. Economy got a lot better, but the problem remains. Drove it over to a mechanic, he said injectors are fine, cat works, sensors too (he cleaned MAP and MAF sensor). There aren't that many Hyundai cars here, so mechanics have no experience with these engines or their faults.

I used to use one at work.  In fact, I have conducted workplace CO inspections and produced reports for my job.  Those meters can be handy for certain situations.  I am a bit confused about your experience.  Here is why.

**Misfiring gasoline powered engines don't produce increased carbon monoxide.**  

Even though people think that they do, they don't.  In fact, they can't!  Misfires are often caused by ignition problems.  When a spark does not occur, there is no explosion and the fuel air mixture in that cylinder or combination of cylinders does not get burned.  Therefore, the exhaust gases of **misfiring** engines end up containing **excess O2 and HC** or oxygen and raw gasoline as they are commonly called.  Carbon monoxide or **CO is produced** when the fuel air mixture experiences **incomplete combustion** because of an incorrect fuel air ratio.   The particular imbalance that causes high CO is called a rich mixture because the proportion of O2 available is insufficient to properly burn the HC in the mixture.  A misfiring engine can't cause elevated CO because with no combustion occurring in a cylinder it cannot have incomplete combustion.  

I am an experienced smog tech and tune up man and I don't have any idea what you are talking about.  First you described misfires but then you changed parts that have nothing to do with misfires.  It is possible that a MAP sensor or O2 sensor had something to do with a rich mixture but somehow, I don't get the impression that an actual mechanic has diagnosed your vehicle.  

What kind of car do you have?  If you keep a modern vehicle tuned properly and repair problems as they occur, then there will be no need to concern yourself with the threat of CO exposure.  That said, CO is very dangerous for several reasons.  This poisonous gas frightens me because it is odorless and its affinity for hemoglobin makes CO exposure cumulative and persistent.   

What kind of detector do you have?

Predictable-Past-912 (Score: 1): If your vehicle is running okay, then you will be safe.  Even though your truck is around thirty years old, it is capable of running fairly clean when everything is shipshape.  If that truck is newer than the 1996 model year it should have what we call an OBDII compliant emissions system installed.  If your engine management system is intact with the catalytic converter still installed and functioning, then a simple emissions test can verify that your engine is running clean.  If you want an extra element of safety, then an emissions inspection can certify with certainty if your engine is running properly and demonstrate how well the emissions systems are managing the exhaust gases.  

Get it checked.

Hopefully then you benefit from reading the results in the HC, NOx, and especially CO columns of the emissions report."

If I ever had a very unbalanced tire I used a feature in the balance to help find the best spot for matching tire to rim and that almost always brought balance weight to a minimum.

The lady asked about it on another appointment and they said they must have noticed the tire moving up and down a bit and this helps with reducing the tire from bouncing on the road. 

I want to call BS but in figured I’d ask.

1okjbdt,Engine Misfire,"A few days ago my 2010 ford fusion sel with a 3.0 v6, the 6th cylinder had started misfiring and I’ve driven it the past two days and the car is running completely fine. About three days ago I’m driving and the car starts shaking a little bit in reverse and in drive and I thought maybe I was just overthinking it because it wasn’t shaking a lot but it was still noticeable. The check engine light had already been on since I got the car and had no history of misfiring, it was on because of a loose/missing gas cap except the car says no cap on it. Anyways, I go to O’Reillys for them to read the check engine light and they tell me that the code “ PO306 indicates cylinder 6 had too many misfires within a predetermined period of time” and the likely solution is to replace the fuel injector. I leave to go home and my car starts shaking the more I accelerate up to around 30-40 mph or just accelerating in general. The check engine light starts blinking so once I get home I turn the car off for the rest of the day, the next morning my dad goes out to my car and puts his reader in the dashboard to get the previous codes, copy them and clear them. He told me that once I got home from school for the day to drive it around the block until maybe the engine light comes on so he can read it when he gets home from work. Him being a mechanic, he was going to help fix my car this weekend. Anyways I get home and drive the car for about 7 minutes even going over 40-45mph which was around the speed it was shaking, nothing was happening. The car was running good and the engine light didn’t come on. The next day (today) I drive my car to school, to town, and home and around the block a few times while within the whole time of driving it I got up to 60mph out of curiosity. I know that was maybe not a smart idea to test the engine like that incase of it to misfire again but I was confused and curious. The car is running good with no misfiring so far, nothing shaking, no engine light. 

The days before the misfire it was really really rainy and I have a window that’s not closed all the way so I have a tarp on the car at night but the night before the misfire I didn’t put a tarp on and just put a towel on the door to keep the rain out. And the next day(the day of the misfire) it was a good sunny day. I only include this because I read somewhere that a misfire one day and it running good days later could’ve been from moisture or something like that.

You can get a coolant pressure test kit and pressurize the cooling system to the PSI written on the coolant cap. Then look around for exterior leaks. 

Then see if your pressure drops. This will verify the leak is here somewhere.

Borescopes are exceptionally cheap nowadays. A small camera that often plugs up to your phone. Buy one that sees both straight and 90°. Remove your spark plugs and use the borescope to inspect the inside of the cylinders, often you can see the coolant leaking in the cylinder. You can leave the system pressurized for hours, if the pressure drops, then bring it back up occasionally. This will cause a puddle of coolant which will be easier to find.  

All that does is verify your head gasket failure, but that’s what you asked for. I hope that’s not it and you find an external leak. 

Feel free to ask questions as you go."

It stops after driving around for a while, sometimes in a few min sometimes longer. Could be that the sound just goes very low as well, to a point where I can’t hear it. 

I also notice it when starting the engine after the cars auto start stop engine kicks in. So from ”off” to on again.

1okgcp1,I did my first diagnostic on a friend's car. How'd I do?,"I wish I had photos, but I don't. A little history here:

The car had prior issues, most notably, a coolant leak. I'm pretty sure it overheated, but I'm not clear if the car steamed out.

She went to a mechanic for OBD ""cylinder misfire,"" assuming the spark plugs went bad. The mechanic scoped the car and denied service because there was coolant in the cylinders.

She sent it to her dad, who swapped the spark plugs, ignition coils, and... I thought he shade treed the head gasket, but mind I'm getting translations from someone who doesn't know cars. After much more conversation, I think he actually did the valve cover gasket, CVS hose, spark plugs, and ignition coils.

She called and asked if I could look at the car. Apparently, the car wasn't able to shift into higher gears, engine shakes, wouldn't always start, etc. I declined because I'm not going to try to reverse engineer the mountain of issues that a bad head gasket job could cause. It's way out of my knowledge sphere.

Last night, she asked me to come by and look at it because ""the starter went out."" If I could fix that, maybe the car will run right again?

Fine, I went over. There's crank but no start. I pump the gas and the engine comes to life. A massive cloud of white smoke plumed from the exhaust.

The OBD is showing misfires on 2 of the 3 cylinders, and an error on the Oxygen sensor.

I disconnected the ignition coils, one at a time, and there was no idle drop on two of them. 

I turned off the car, pulled the coils, and I see green substance on two of the spark plugs. Dielectric grease isn't green, is it?

I pull off the CSV hose and see more green substance in it.

I opened the coolant reservoir, and it looks like it was just water. I asked her was color the coolant the car takes. She wasn't sure.

This is a mid-2000s Ford SUV. I'll mention that this is the ugliest engine I've ever laid eyes on. It sits sideways, the accessories are covered up, and it looks like an utter PITA to do anything beyond spark plugs and filling fluids.

Anyways...

I drive the car up the driveway, and hear the moan of the steering wheel pump. Well, that explains some of the fluid on the ground. She knew about the leak. I poured about 5oz into the reservoir, and the fluid immediately started to drip out.

The pump looked relatively new, so my guess is a hose. The feeder hose and the low pressure hose looks fine. The pump and high pressure hose is buried too deep to see anything, so maybe the high pressure hose wasn't connected right when the pump was replaced a year ago.

I get under the car, and the oil pan is covered in something. She insisted that it was power steering fluid. I check the oil and it's dry. 

""Oh, there's an oil leak too. I just put oil into it 2 months ago."" The car hasn't been driven much at all during that time.

Okay, so I told her, BEST case, that the mechanic is wrong about the head gasket (maybe try Blue Devil and pray. 😕) I'm pretty sure that gasket is blown, maybe the block is cracked. idk.

The ignition coils were Dorman, compatible according to AutoZone, but you can get Motorcraft from Walmart for much cheaper (that's what's on Ford's website), new spark plugs... The coils didn't feel like they fit correctly. There was a piece of coat hanger rigged over the ingnition coils to, I guess, hold them down?


O2 sensors (maybe?) are friggin expensive.

It can be so much worse though. Maybe the wiring for the ignition coils are bad, and we have to figure out the coolant leak. There's so much fluid leaking that I can't be sure if it is or isn't.

Anyways, I gave the car a vote of no confidence. Best case scenario is $500 to $1000 in parts alone, and that's pretty much just going to tell me there are more gremlins, I think.

From my description, do you all think I did okay here?

 The headgasket is most likely blown, and if that isnt addressed, then nothing else matters.  All the maintenance in the world wont fix a head gasket. Don't try and sell her on the coils and everything else until after the headgasket is confirmed as bad and then fixed. A block test kit is cheap and its an easy test that yiu can do anywhere. It will confirm if the head gasket is blown. Any pour in additives will not fix a head gasket issue and it will only make things worse in the long term. 

Its obvious from the condition of the car that the owner does not take care of it. Having her friends and family work it when its this bad is kind of indicative of her not wanting to take care of the car. Im not saying that youre doing anything wrong or bad. But having people that arent professionals fix your car with coat hangers kind of leads me to believe that she just wants to continue to limp it along and not actually fix it.

Now, the car won’t start at all, which I kind of expected. My question is… what would cause the battery to smoke? I have some other batteries around the property, could I possibly swap one of them?

Overcharging, internal short, maybe something else. If I were you, I'd install a new battery and then check the charging voltage. If it's way above than 14.x volts, you need to check the voltage at the alternator. If your alternator is bad, it would kill all batteries you throw at your car. Also, high voltage is not good for car modules (computers).

Any 12V car battery of the same chemistry should work, just pay attention to the polarity and make sure it fits the slot. Your cables may be too short, so don't hold your breath."
1ol9a7c,Arnold Clark MOT advice - can I fight this,"Right folks, looking for a bit of advice or experience here.
I’ve got a 2019 DS3 Crossback, 1 previous ..It just went in for its MOT at Arnold Clark the last one included with my plan  and I also have their Autocare warranty that’s supposed to cover things like calipers, maybe discs, and other major components.

After the MOT, I noticed a weird squeak/chirp sound coming from the rear end when driving, so I took it straight back in. To their credit, they were interested enough to get it booked for investigation.

They’ve now come back saying the following:
Driver’s side rear brake and disc have issues.
Pad is “within guidance,” but they recommend replacement.

Disc has red rust/corrosion around the rim and inner surface.

They say the caliper is seized or seizing, and that’s what’s causing the issue. But will only replace if it needs to be - but the break and disc needs to be replaced 

Here’s what I’m trying to figure out:
1.If a caliper really is seized, wouldn’t the disc normally show blue discoloration from heat rather than red rust?
2.If it’s seized badly enough to cause brake performance issues, should it have even passed the MOT?

Also, this car’s brakes have always been a bit squeaky, even before the MOT — could that be connected? Like, maybe the caliper has been gradually sticking and just got worse?

As when I bought the car they said the squeak would go away never had had them look at it last year they applied this blue stuff but only went away so long 

And if Arnold Clark themselves are saying it’s a seized caliper, that’s one of the components listed as covered under the Autocare warranty — so shouldn’t it be repaired or replaced under that?

They’re planning to look at it again on Wednesday while they “seek a resolution,” but I’m wondering what angle I should take here.
Is there any chance of:
•	Getting the repair covered fully (since it’s a listed part under warranty), or
•	At least negotiating a partial cost reduction, given the timing right after their MOT and the lack of any MOT video explanation of the findings?

The car’s still drivable, but I’m honestly getting the feeling this might turn into one of those Arnold Clark learning experiences.

Would love to hear from anyone who’s dealt with something similar am I right to push for them to take responsibility here or get some money off this like I know it’s not gonna be free…. 


TLDR: 2019 DS3 Crossback — MOT done at Arnold Clark, now there’s a chirp/squeak. They say rear caliper’s seizing, disc has red rust, pads “within guidance.” Should it have passed MOT? And if it’s a seized caliper (their words), shouldn’t it be covered under my Autocare warranty or at least reduced in cost?

I passed my driving test on Tuesday and I’m trying to figure out insurance now.

My parents already have their own policy on their car, and adding me as a named driver would be around £400 a month, which is really expensive.

I want to be able to drive their car until I buy my own. Can I get my own separate policy for the same car, or do I need some kind of temporary/“borrowing someone else’s car” policy?

Seriously though, I don't think there's any rule that says a car can't be covered by two separate policies, providing they aren't held by the same person. I would, however, be surprised if a policy with you as the main driver was cheaper than adding you as a named driver on their policy. Is their policy already pretty heavily spec'd (high mileage, business use etc). Maybe the additional new/young driver pushes it over some risk threshold.

ETA, you might have trouble finding them because the single buckle \*might\* be borrowed from a different model. A scrap/parts dealer probably just looks at the platform prefix (the first 3 letters of the part number) and assigns that platform as the source.

EG some parts for my R8 have ""8K0"" prefix. 8K0 is the A4. So if a part from an unknown car lands at their door with 8K0 they will likely just sell it as being an A4 part, even though it's used in other models too, and maybe didn't even come off an A4.

1oktfl0,Looking for some help and advice,"Hello Reddit,

I want to upgrade my car, I’m about to turn 27, I make £35k a year atm (likely promotion in summer next year) and have potential to earn extras through OT weekend shifts and other benefits. 

I work in film and drive 5+ days a week, about 35 miles mostly motorway. I currently have a 2016 bmw 218i but it’s turbo has recently gone, and short term I’ll repair and keep going in it until around March next year when insurance ends. 

I pay £900 rent + bills etc. I’m looking to upgrade to a new car March next year but I’m having doubts on which direction to go in. I love BMWs and would love a 3L straight 6 b57 but I’m not sure if it’s the right decision. 

I could put down around £8-10k comfortably and pay around £350 a month after that for a HP. I don’t like the idea of pcp balloon payments. This puts rough budget at £24k.

1okruyq,Arnold Clark - Edinburgh Seafield Motorstore - BEWARE!,"Our dealings with Arnold Clark have been terrible. This is out story....

My son bought a used car from the Edinburgh Seafield branch in Feb' 2023. The name of the salesman is withheld although I'd love to share it. 

We asked that, given the car's age, if there was any documentation detailing when the timing belt was last replaced. The salesman confirmed there wasn't any. 

As the car was seven years old and we believed that for this model of vehicle, the belt should be replaced a 100k miles or when the vehicle was six years old, we therefore asked for the belt to be replaced before we took receipt of the car. The salesman agreed this would be done.

At no time did he refuse or push back in any way on this matter. There was no quoting ""company policy"" at that time.

He then went on to explain to us that collection of the car would be delayed as it would ""need to be booked into the workshop to have the work carried out""...that statement is a direct quote from the salesman concerned.

The salesman then called us a few days later confirming the work was completed and the car was ready for collection.

He also confirmed this as he was handing us the keys to the vehicle on the day of collection. When we drove off with the car that evening, we were unaware it was a ticking timebomb

Furthermore, we also asked several times, for him to email us confirming the work had been done, showing date and mileage. This was promised but never sent, and it was only requested so we could give to any new owner should we ever sell the car in the future. So, there was no immediate urgency from our perspective. How wrong we were!

The car started giving problems a few weeks ago. These were diagnosed as a delaminating timing belt. Inspection confirmed the belt on the car was the original fitted when the car was built.

A phone call to Arnold Clark Service Department confirmed the work had never been done.

The salesman had blatantly and premeditatedly lied to us several times, and is now doubling down on that lie, although he has no alternative I suppose - repeatedly lying to a customer is a sackable offence I'd imagine, even for a company of Arnold Clark's reputation.

We have followed the company's complaints procedure (ref #582569), but unsurprisingly, they are taking the salesman's word on the matter - effectively calling myself and my son, both of us having been present and witnessed everything, liars.

Arnold Clark is also trying to blame us for not having the timing belt inspected as part of a scheduled service. This is misdirection - if we'd known when we bought the car, that it was the original belt, we'd have had it inspected as a matter of urgency - we certainly would not have waited until a service was due. 

The car has had a basic service as required. The timing belt was not inspected as part of that service as we were led to believe it was brand new.

Just to rub salt in the wound, the salesman has asked for proof he agreed to have the work done, which is cute - he knows we asked for this several times and each time we were fobbed off - and it points to the premeditated nature of his actions. 

If we as customers are guilty of anything, it’s being naïve and believing an unprincipled salesman who'll say anything to get his commission. Beware of buying a second-hand vehicle from Arnold Clark Seafield. Take nothing the salesman says on trust! 

Since having these issues, several individuals in the Edinburgh motor trade have reached out to me, basically confirming the company is well known for this kind of unprincipled behaviour. One person told me they were “great at selling cars, an absolute nightmare to deal with after the sale has gone through”. How right that statement is! 

Arnold Clark Complaints Dept - The name of the salesman is available on request!

P.S. - we have recently exhausted the company's complaint's procedure (ref #582569). Last week they contacted us to confirm as far as they are concerned, the matter is now closed. We were informed at that time, that given ""it's the salesman's word against ours"", they've chosen to believe their salesman. How's that for 5-star customer service!

Symptoms:

Creaks when turning onto my driveway (slight incline and wheels turned all but full lock) happens in either direction

Creaks quite loudly when dry-steering at full lock with brake / Auto Hold engaged (not on the handbrake though)

No creak driving straight up the driveway

Rear ride height adjuster replaced (was seized — helped but didn’t fix issue)

ARB bushes greased (improved a little but noise remains)

Front and Rear drop links recently replaced

So i paid already like 3 months, and i was in garage with car where dude said to listed cerfully engine as sometimes you can hear timing chain playing around.
Its fine its nothing serious (confirmed its not biggie rn by specs) but i wonder if my cover will well cover it.

I called WW and they confirmed its incorrected and told me to contact seller.
Now im in mail war with them for mis seling but they just repeat endlessly that my cover is gold and car is covered by that...
Is it tho?

Should i cancel it? Give up in refund?

I got one included with a car I purchased a couple of years ago. They (WW, not the dealer) told me it covered any mechanical or electrical issues that weren’t present when the car was purchased. A week after purchase, the electric power steering failed. I contacted them and they told me to get a quote from a local garage and they’ll reimburse me. I got a quote and the repair would cost £1200 inc VAT and labour. I told them, and they told me to not repair it there but instead take it to a local WW approved garage, so I did. They told me they can’t fix it, it has to be taken to a garage local to where the car was from. I told them I didn’t really want to drive a car with power steering that could just switch off, 70 miles, and their suggestion was to reject the car. I contacted the place I bought it from, told them all of this and they had agreed, but I had the same issue where I had to drive 70 miles. Instead I just paid for the repair myself. 

If I were you, I’d see if I could get a refund on what you paid for if you have it in writing was that it was meant to include that. If you don’t have it in writing, then you’re SOL, cancel it if you have to pay more. 

Sindans (Score: 7): Warrantywise is a *discretionary* warranty, which means it isn’t FCA-regulated insurance and as such they can choose whether to pay a claim. If you’re buying cover (which I believe from personal experience can be incredibly useful at times), look for an insured provider (ask who the underwriter is and if there’s an IPID), and if you're fortunate enough to have a newer car keep/extend the manufacturer warranty - its the safest bet by a long shot. 

If you bought the car recently from a dealer 3 months ago in-line with the warrantywise policy, remember your Consumer Rights Act protections are with the dealer, not the warranty company.
