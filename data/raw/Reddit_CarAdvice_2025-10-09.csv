NtSFstEddie (Score: 1): The thermostat is closed when a running engine is cold, and it doesn't cause leaks. There won't be any more back pressure form a closed thermostat when it's hot, but there will be more pressure in the entire system when the coolant gets hot and expands from heating. 

Even a failed thermostat won't cause leaks as long as the pressure relief valve in the radiator cap is working because the relief valve in the cap will release that pressure into the overflow holding tank before it gets that high. That is unless a part has deteriorated from time like your radiator is and it fails before the pressure builds enough for the pressure relief valve to open.

The radiator leak alone will make it overheat so change that radiator first and watch the temperature. If it still overheats, then look into changing the thermostat."
1o1r61q,2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee Coolant leak after an oil change at Walmart,"Hey everyone, need some help diagnosing an issue with my 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee.

I noticed coolant pooling under my Jeep on the driver's side, underneath the engine. When I investigated, I found what looks like two open connection points about 2 feet apart - they appear to be missing hoses or tubes.

**Location:** Driver's side, under the engine, near where the radiator drain plug is located (the one with the red cap).

**Symptoms:**

* Coolant leak
* No heat from cabin vents
* Possible leaking from the radiator drain plug or near

I've circled the areas in red in the photos. Does anyone know what's supposed to be connected here? It looks like some kind of hose or tube is missing.

Is this part of the heater hose system? If so, what's the part called and where can I get it? Does AutoZone carry something like this?

1o1pmnw,VW botched my oil change and I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre lying to me.,"Location: North Carolina 

I purchased my 2021 Volkswagen Atlas earlier this year. I had saved my money and paid a little under $20,000 in cash for one with a rebuilt title. The car was beautiful‚Äî in perfect condition and barely driven. It had been totaled because of some damage to the roof, which was repaired by the body shop I purchased it from.
Since I had this beautiful car, I decided to take it to the dealership for all of its maintenance. In the past, I never would‚Äôve done that; I would‚Äôve had my husband change the oil or taken it to a quick oil change place. But this time, I thought I was doing the right thing by going to the dealership.
Yesterday, I took it to the dealership where they performed an oil change, replaced the brake fluid and the pollen filter, and patched a small part of the rubber shoe***  where I had found a nail. The total cost was almost $600.
I live about 30 minutes from the dealership, and on my way home‚Äîabout one mile from my house‚Äîthe oil pressure light came on. I pulled over to the side of the road but didn‚Äôt know what to do or what it meant. I figured I just needed to make it home. As soon as I pulled into my driveway, the check engine light came on. I turned the car off immediately, got out, and looked underneath. There was oil everywhere‚Äîcovering the bottom of the car and splattered all over the back. When you open the driver or passenger door, you can even see splatters on the inside door panels.
I started freaking out and called the dealership. I was actually crying while talking to them because I had no idea what was happening. The service manager called me back, and he sent a tow truck with a courtesy car to my house to pick up my vehicle. He seems like he‚Äôs trying to make it right, but I haven‚Äôt heard back from them yet about my car.
Spoke To the dealership tonight they said the gasket had folded and the pressure had pushed the oil filter off, they said they redid the oil change and road tested it and it‚Äôs fine.

Oil filter gasket? 'Had folded'? Not sure what that means but it sure sounds like they're owning up to a botched install. You need to get that documented because the real question is how long you drove with no oil and if any damage was done. Even if you fill back up and it seems to drive ok, engine life could be very significantly shortened. They should clarify what they'll do if they killed your engine.

66NickS (Score: 2): If your oil pressure (not oil level) light was on and you continued driving the vehicle, then you likely caused damage to the engine. Since you continued driving the vehicle, this damage could be your responsibility/liability.  

It‚Äôs possible for gaskets to fail/be misaligned/have other issues that causes the oil leak.  This could be a part defect or a poor work quality if it wasn‚Äôt installed properly.  

It‚Äôs very difficult or nearly impossible to determine if any notable damage occurred. You‚Äôd have to do significant engine disassembly to be certain. 

A shop could do some things like:
- a compression/leak down test which might show if there‚Äôs an issue in the combustion chambers/cylinders.
- a visual/borescope inspection to check the cylinder walls for grooves.
- an oil change/flush and inspection of the filter media for metal shavings. 

But those may not be definitive if nothing shows. 

Since it‚Äôs a salvage title, make sure any warranty you get covered salvage titles as many warranties may not.

If it was the ac compressor it would be on all speeds and the sound would come from the engine bay not the interior.

If you chucked OE coils for aftermarket, you very likely have a bad coil pack.  If they are new OE coils I'd be less suspicious of them but still, easy first step is swapping them to see if the misfire follows that number 4.

Perhaps a longer bolt (to reach the good threads deeper in that appear to be crack-free) with a thread sealer may stop it from leaking.  The thread sealer will not require a high clamping load to prevent leaking, reducing the strain on the crack.

A metal epoxy like JB weld or Devcon steel epoxy may also work to seal it.

Repair would be to weld it or maybe that aluminum brazing stuff, then cut new threads.  Or replace the case/tranny.

But when I got off the car everything seemed fine. I checked around my car and nothing was there.

Any ideas on what might be wrong? 

This was 2 days ago, I don‚Äôt know if its related because it hasn‚Äôt been happening until that happened, I can‚Äôt say for yesterday because I haven‚Äôt been paying attention. But today it was too noticeable.

First things first, go take a break and relax, have a snack,  breathe, whatever. You‚Äôre in this situation because you weren‚Äôt being mindful about removing that bolt 

Once you feel better, buy a Left Hand Drill Bit Set and a Screw Extractor Set. The screw extractor sets are spiral shaped. And also some WD-40. 

First you use the drill bits. use wd-40 as cutting oil/lubricant, and drill at a slow rpm. Obviously, drill into the middle of the broken bolt. Even pressure with your hand but not too much that you bust the drill bit. 
Start with a smaller drill bit. Then get one of the spiral extractors and give it some gentle taps with a hammer to seat it into the hole you just made with the drill. 

When I use spiral extractors I turn them by hand with a wrench, I don‚Äôt use them with my drill.  If that doesn‚Äôt work, go one size up. The goal is to make a hole big enough that you can tap in the screw extractor securely and be able to gently turn it out.

A couple of weeks ago after dropping my kids off at daycare my car wouldn't start. I turned the key and everything (lights, radio etc.) came on but the engine. After sitting and intermittently trying to start my car for about an hour it suddenly started again and I drove straight to my mechanic. It started every time for him no problem. He suggested that it was probably the starter starting to go.

Last Tuesday same thing but this time it started making a clicking/grinding noise when i tried to start it. I couldn't get it started and had to have it towed. By the time my mechanic got around to it it started just fine for him again. I gave him the go ahead to replace the starter since that's what he figured it was the last time.

Here we are today (I didn't shut my car off yesterday at drop off so thats why it's a day late lol) again it will not start, again I had to have it towed, but this time I took a video. I'm confident that by the time he gets around to it it will start just fine for him again.

It only seems to happen a week apart

So far I haven't had problems starting the car after it's been sitting for awhile like overnight or all day at work

If you cannot or will not do it right you're better off leaving it be as you could create a problem by incorrect fill or wrong ATF etc.

She's great all around, but the battery is smaller than the tray, not be alot but enough to shimmy around. We replaced the battery clamps, and now we're on to fixing the actual issue that caused the clamps to wear out and become loose. We're looking at battery hold down clamps, like the L hook kits or the small plates that look like door hinges, and want to settle on the L hook kits. My only concern is the size of the L hooked to the battery clamp and battery size, compared to the tray itself. There's about a 2.5 inch gap between the battery sitting properly and the edge of the tray. Does anyone have experience in what to do to ensure it stays put? Recommendations? We can do a makeshift shim, I've got some great wooden slots to place down in the tray that are super flat and would anchor the battery even with the L hook clamp kit, but I'm just curious what others have done.

P0430 is a cat efficiency code (same as P0420, just refers to the second bank of a V6 or V8). This code is set when the bank 2 post-catalyst narrowband O2 sensor (I think that's ""sensor 6"" on this sheet) senses too much oxygen getting past the cat. Usually caused by a bad cat but can be exhaust leaks, bad sensors or other weird issues. A better OBD scan tool can pull up the freeze frame data from when the code was thrown to see if it's not as straightforward as the cat being bad.

The second should oscillate slowly and be more lean reading as the cats take out unburned fuel. So you need to hook up a scanner and graph the primary and secondary sensors. Could be the cat efficiency is bad or could be that either o2 is not accurate

Since you have driving problems could be that the primary o2 on bank b is inaccurate and giving bad fueling to the engine when then is misfiring. Or you could have misfires sending uncombusted fuel out, or perhaps cat is clogged. Usually you would get misfire codes too"

My goal is to never pay another shop for anything except body work and paint, and I may pick that up later once I have everything dialed in mechanically. 

It took two things for me to find the motivation - finding the right car(s) for me, and the ridiculous invoice I paid last year on the Prelude for a bunch of custom work. I absolutely could have done all of it myself, but I lacked confidence. A 9k invoice really helped me find it. 

So, the best time to learn was yesterday. The second best time is today. If you put it off, you‚Äôll always find something else that takes precedence. 

My advice, don‚Äôt buy a non-running car for your first project. Don‚Äôt buy one that barely runs, and don‚Äôt buy one with rust. Oh, and don‚Äôt start with European cars because $$$$. Find something with great aftermarket support, because nothing kills progress more than discontinued parts.

I had the tyres changed today (they weren‚Äôt old but the tyre shop said they were cheap and f**ked) and it has definitely improved, but I feel like they weren‚Äôt the only thing causing the vibration:

- if I‚Äôm doing 100+ on the freeway, the instant that I stop accelerating and just coast, I get a very high frequency vibration. I don‚Äôt mean high frequency like a high pitch, it just seems to be very ‚Äúfast‚Äù but still a low pitch if that makes sense

- if I‚Äôm at a lower speed (eg. 30-50km/h) and stop accelerating, or start braking to slow down I get a vibration as well but it‚Äôs a much lower frequency and a lot heavier, almost like the cabin to starts to shake more than the vibration at high speed

- for more info, if I‚Äôm accelerating from standing uphill, it‚Äôs virtually non-existent. But vice versa if I‚Äôm coming downhill and start to decelerate or brake, then it‚Äôs terrible and at its worst

I took it to a mechanic and he seemed to think it was the drive shaft, potentially a seized uni joint or maybe out of balance, but he only really took it for a spin around the corner so didn‚Äôt get the full picture.

While it's possible that each window developed the same problem at the same time, it's far more likely that your power window switch on the drivers door either has a wire pulled out (from throwing open the door too many times) or it's just gone to pot. 

  
An easy test to run is to have someone listen at the door of the window you're trying to roll up. They should be able to hear the motor in the door operate. If all the doors have no sound like that, then I'd say look at your switch on the drivers door.

Get clarification on everything so that way you feel comfortable.

Putting your vehicle in drive/park or park/drive while parking on an incline put more strain on the mechanism that locks the transmission in park then a slight tap from your friend.


With such little damage to your car, id literally bet money that its fine. Double check that all your doors open and close normally. Check your trunk too. Its possible the hinges for your trunk could be bent if the trunk didn't want to close normally but its unlikely with no other damage.


To be 100% with you, its more likely your spare wheel is bent then anything. It can be difficult to see with the naked eye.


I cant stress enough how unlikely it is that theres any damage. Especially in a jeep which is one of the ""tougher"" vehicles because of the true frame. In the future, using the parking/emergency brake in addition to putting the vehicle in park when you park, helps take the strain off the trans."

The drastic increase in the repair cost, especially for parts that seem unrelated to the initial damage, is a major red flag.
Here‚Äôs a breakdown of your options and an answer to your question about price matching.
## What Are Your Options?
 * Contact Your Insurance Adjuster Immediately: This is your most important step. Your insurance company is paying for the repair and must approve any supplemental costs. Inform your adjuster that the estimate has jumped from $13,000 to $21,000 and that the shop is replacing parts you believe are undamaged (front grill, back quarter panel). They have a vested interest in not paying for fraudulent or unnecessary repairs.
 * Request a Detailed Itemized Invoice: Ask the body shop for a complete, line-by-line breakdown of every part and labor charge. Send this document directly to your insurance adjuster for review. An adjuster can determine if the requested repairs are consistent with the initial damage.
 * Authorize a Stop-Work Order: You can tell the shop to halt all further repairs until this issue is sorted out with your insurance company. This will prevent the bill from growing even larger while you investigate.
 * Dispute the Unrelated Repairs: Directly question the shop manager about why the front grill and rear quarter panel need replacement. A side impact can sometimes cause unseen damage that affects panel alignment elsewhere, but they must be able to prove and document why those specific repairs are necessary. Your insurance adjuster is the best person to challenge this.
## Is It Reasonable to Ask the Shop to Match Prices?
While you can always ask, it is highly unlikely that the shop will match the online price for parts. Here's why:
 * Business Model: Body shops make a profit by marking up the price of parts they source. This markup covers their sourcing efforts, shipping, handling, and the warranty they provide on both the part and their labor.
 * Liability and Warranty: Shops typically refuse to install parts provided by customers because they cannot guarantee the quality or authenticity of the part. If a customer-supplied part fails, it creates a difficult liability situation. By sourcing the part themselves, they take full responsibility.
Your focus should not be on the price of individual parts, but on the necessity of the repairs themselves. The real issue is the potential inflation of the repair scope, which is a matter for your insurance company to resolve with the shop."

Hey everyone, I‚Äôm at my wits‚Äô end with my 2013 F30 328i (N26)

About a year ago I had a minor fender bender and replaced the hood/front bumper with same-color parts from a junkyard ‚Äî no mechanical issues at all. Later, I replaced a cracked valve cover gasket. Unfortunately, the mechanic (who mostly works on older cars) seems to have botched the job.

After the valve cover replacement, the car developed terrible cold starts ‚Äî revs jump all over for ~15 sec before idling normally ‚Äî and now throws multiple misfire codes. The mechanic went from saying the car was ‚Äúmint‚Äù to ‚Äúengine‚Äôs toast‚Äù overnight with no legitimate explanation as to how or why the engine was fucked. Seems like he made a mistake and wanted to try and use the fact it‚Äôs a BMW to convince me it was just a POS engine. 

A second shop made things worse: during an oil change they stripped the drain plug, causing a major leak, then tried to charge me $250 to ‚Äúfind the cause.‚Äù Now I‚Äôm worried they might have damaged the engine further by running it low on oil.

Current code points to a high-pressure fuel pump issue (‚Äútoo much fuel pressure / sensor not accounting for airflow‚Äù). Yet I‚Äôve had other mobile techs have differing opinions.

Lastly, I am sure I will sometimes be buying mechanics specials and just fixing whatever is cheap and looks easy to fix and flip. However, I would prefer it if I could work on cars that are of interest to me, which fortunately for me is a lot of cars. I would enjoy working on 90s Accords and Civics, or old Toyota pickups, or old VW Beetles or something like that. 

With this set of expectations is it realistic that I could make a little money? Realistically if I could make ~$10k a year working 10-20 hours a week I would be very happy. My dream would be to become knowledgeable about some niche of cars like 70s super beetles or something like that, and buy them and partially restore them and sell them.

1o1dbgr,Brake failure/pad refuse? Road tar? Leak?,"2007 Jeep Liberty. About halfway through my 15 mile commute this morning I started hearing what sounded like my rear passenger brakes dragging on the highway. At intersections on acceleration it sounded like a helicopter revving up. 

Now that the sun is up and I had time, this is what I am seeing. Most of this at the rear of the brake caliper, and a smaller amount in front where it was pulled through. It is a thick oily black substance.

The rotor face looks clean, which is why I am questioning whether it's overheated pad material. Is this a telltale sign of something you've experienced? Is there any fluid leak that would appear like this hitting a hot rotor? It does not smell of tar, no smell at all that I can detect.

The brakes and rotor were replaced a year and a half ago. They still feel like they are braking normally.

1o1oak5,DoIP dongle and J2534 Windows API,"Hello

 Ive been playing around trying to understand the ""functionality"" of various dongles. There is a J2534 logger (on github), that can help snoop API interactions between a Car manufacturers software and the corresponding OBDII dongle connected to the car. 

Ive tried this with SDD (from JLR) and a simple ODB dongle (e.g. VCX Nano). Now other than ""toggling"" the lines of the ODBII connector, I have not understood the value that these dongles bring.

I also tried to do this with PathFinder which expects to talk to a DoIP dongle. There are simple ""DoiP"" dongles that basically have a RJ45 connector at another end. I wanted to see a similar interaction by using the same J2534 logger, but somehow its bypassed and the ptshim dll does not get loaded, to be able to insert itself between the software and driver.

Does DoIP-J2534 API require more calls to be supported by the shim? Im using the same VCX Nano, and checked DoIP support in VxManager (no license popup comes up later), as an experiment.

So the DoIP functionality does get invoked, but somehow the logger is not called.

Take it to an independent shop. Dealerships are for warranty work and overcharge for nearly everything else.

The valve cover gasket isnt related to your starting issue and a starter for your car cost around $200-300 ...plus maybe an hour or 2 for labor. So independent shop may charge you $500-600 unless there is something else going on. 

It's also entirely possible you just need a new battery... Which would be $100-150...so, yeah take it to an independent shop for a 2nd opinion and quote.

The worst problem you might get from not putting new caps on would be degradation of the Schrader valve seals causing a slow refrigerant leak.

Edit: I read the rest of your story and now see that the AC already not working. I would wager that the system is not fully charged with refrigerant. Take it somewhere to have the system evacuated then recharged with the proper amount specified on the AC sticker under the hood. If it works with a full charge then you probably have a slow leak which will need to be diagnosed separately if you dont want to keep recharging the system every year."

The other type have an opening on the side, which is fine, but they're designed to be used with strut rods that have an internal hex on the end. The pass thru type make it easier to slide a 1/4 socket down through the center to grip the external hex on your strut rod.

I know the whole thing is rusted and needs to be replaced, I just need to know what this exact part is, or what rebuild kit it comes with.
Symptoms -
- Rotational scraping/whirling sound when reversing in the FR tire (purely has to do with something in the steering/sway column)
- Metal dinging around, like a pipe being dropped constantly, in the FR while driving
- pirate ship like loose steering
- a metal sound i cant describe while turning all the way to the right, like an intense click but its two pieces of metal fighting.

I plan on rebuilding the whole steering column and maybe brakes and rotors, but I assume that may only fix my loose steering (hopefully) and the weird whirring sound, and im hoping this part is causing alot of the other issues.

Throttle body dash pot might be worn down. It's like a cushion for the throttle body cable wheel. When you let go of the throttle pedal, it'll slow down the throttle body returning to idle position. Adjusting the throttle cable to idle a little bit higher might mitigate it.

Idle control valve/ICV, idle air control/IAC. Underneathe throttle body. Might be overly dirty from the oil vapours of the PCV system over the many years.

Where people tend to get in trouble is with a transmission fluid FLUSH, because that forces fluid through the transmission in a way that can disturb debris/clutch material, causing it to get lodged in places it shouldn't be, such as the valve body, etc, which can then cause big problems like burnt clutches due to lack of fluid pressure.

1o0x0ct,My Abs and Traction keep turning off intermittently.,"I have a 99 Lexus es300. 120k km. Atleast once a day my ABS and TRAC turn off and will not return until the car is turned off and turned back on. Sometimes i can do a full 30 minute drive on the highway with both systems working. Somtimes they turn off when i first start the car. There is no pattern that i can notice. The only pattern is that it is fixed by shutting down the car and turning it back on, but this is not permanent obviously.

Some context: my car has both an obd2 and obd1 diagnostic link. The obd2 holds emmisions data and the obd1 is responsible for my abs/trac. I cant seem to find a shop that can properly scan my car.

Ive taken it to 3 shops. The first shop, my main mechanic, told me to change out the entire abs module. He didnt do a very thourough inspection though so i went to get a second opinion. The second shop took one look and told me they couldnt help me. Now im finally getting somewhere with this 3rd shop but they may have ghosted me. 

Am i just going to the wrong shops? Should i be seeking out a shop that specializes in retro vehicles? Any help would be great.

No_Recommendation671 (Score: 1): That gurgling or sloshing sound you hear when accelerating is almost certainly caused by air trapped in your car's cooling system, specifically in the heater core.
The heater core is like a small radiator located behind your dashboard that provides heat to the cabin. When you accelerate, the water pump spins faster, forcing coolant through the system with more pressure. If there's an air pocket in the heater core, the rushing coolant sloshes through it, creating the gurgling sound you're hearing from the dash area.
Why is there air in the system?
There are a few common reasons for air to get into the cooling system:
 * Low Coolant Level: This is the most frequent cause. If the coolant level is low, air can be sucked into the system.
 * Recent Cooling System Service: If you've recently had the coolant flushed or a part like a hose or radiator replaced, the system may not have been properly ""burped"" or bled to remove all the air.
 * A Leak: A leak in a hose, the radiator, the water pump, or a head gasket can let coolant out and air in. A failing head gasket is a more serious issue, as it can force combustion gases into the cooling system.
What should you do?
You should address this issue soon, as air in the cooling system can lead to inefficient cooling and potentially cause the engine to overheat.
 * Check Your Coolant: Wait until the engine is completely cold. Never open the radiator cap on a hot engine. Check the coolant level in the plastic overflow reservoir. If it's low, also check the level in the radiator itself.
 * Top It Off: If the coolant is low, add the correct type of antifreeze/coolant for your vehicle (check your owner's manual) to the proper level.
 * Bleed the System: Often, simply topping off the coolant isn't enough because the air is trapped. The system needs to be bled. While you can do this yourself with the help of online tutorials for your specific car model, a mechanic can do it quickly and effectively. 4.  Check for Leaks: If the coolant level continues to drop after topping it off and bleeding the system, you likely have a leak that needs to be found and repaired by a professional."

(Also a second temp probe for the air temp but thats not important) 

The air flowing past cools the heater element and the temp probe measures it get cooler. Then the computer tracks how much electricity is required to keep the heater at the same temp. The calibration for the sensor is almost always held inside the engine ECU and the more energy needed to keep the heater hot, the more air going into the engine. 

The sensor is estimating flow based on air mass cooling and temp compensation to determine density which gives you volume. There‚Äôs some math involved and no easy ‚Äòunit‚Äô.

You would need to connect a computer to the sensor make a system that can drive and measure the heating element and then calibrate it to get an accurate measurement. 

This is not likely the easiest method.

1o1gqe3,Evans Halshaw charging ¬£500 ‚Äúusage‚Äù fee after major fault ‚Äì is this right?,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm looking for some advice about a refund situation with Evans Halshaw.

I bought a 2018 Mercedes GLA from them on 19th August, and it‚Äôs now early October so I‚Äôve had the car for about 7 weeks. When I first test drove I did notice one clunk noise when driving and asked them to check it out. Since having the car I‚Äôve noticed the noise is still there and gradually got worse, and when I took it back in, their branch local to me (not the one I‚Äôd bought it from)inspected it and then sent it back to the original branch I bought it from.

The more local branch informed me the differential has failed, which is obviously a major mechanical fault. The selling branch now says they want to ‚Äúinspect it themselves‚Äù to confirm the diagnosis, as they don‚Äôt fully trust the other branch‚Äôs report (apparently thinking they may be trying to profit from it basically).

I‚Äôve told them that because it‚Äôs such a serious problem, I‚Äôve lost confidence in the car and would prefer a refund or replacement rather than another repair. They‚Äôve said that‚Äôs may be an option but they‚Äôll be deducting ¬£500 from my refund for ‚Äúmileage usage,‚Äù claiming it‚Äôs allowed ‚Äúby law up to 50p per mile.‚Äù

Since buying it, I‚Äôve only driven around 1,600‚Äì1,700 miles. The car already had about 38,000 miles when I bought it, so it‚Äôs definitely a used vehicle, not new.

I‚Äôve read through Evans Halshaw‚Äôs Customer Information Pack, and there‚Äôs no mention anywhere of a 50p/mile charge, nor any fixed rate being legally set. From what I understand, under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, they can only make a reasonable deduction for use not apply a blanket charge.

So my questions are:
	‚Ä¢	Is there actually any legal mileage rate like they‚Äôre claiming?
	‚Ä¢	Does ¬£500 (around 30p/mile) sound reasonable for a 7-year-old used car that‚Äôs done 40k miles already?
	‚Ä¢	Has anyone else dealt with Evans Halshaw and successfully challenged a usage deduction?

Any advice or experiences would be hugely appreciated I just want to make sure I‚Äôm being treated fairly.

Thanks,
Jessica

*‚ÄúThe ICE tail is now fatter and longer than anybody ever thought it was going to be,‚Äù GM‚Äôs chief financial officer Paul Jacobson said at a recent conference, even as the company continued to invest in new EVs.*

*‚ÄúThat is going to be a much bigger cash flow engine.""*

*‚ÄùThe significant loss of market share in China by foreign brands also leaves the industry with little choice but to seek more sales in the US.""*

I'm a little sceptical about Western strategy re EVs - which according to this article is essentially: ""we make less profit with EVs, and the Chinese are doing all that, so let's go back to petrol!""

I've worked in a 'long tail' sector before, and ultimately, the tail bottomed out far quicker than anyone else thought it could. My particular tail was still profitable - until it wasn't.

My view is that you can lobby governments to extend the EV sales ban, and simply not produce EVs, but you won't get around the fact that consumers who see cars as appliances will see EVs as better 'appliances' and simply move to Chinese EVs. Especially when you consider the cost of a tank of petrol vs even the most expensive service station charger.

My conundrum is that this car is now going to require quite a bit of work - it needs its cambelt replacing, it needs both its rear coils changing, and both of its steering rods (along with wheel alignment, and probably two front tyres). Without the tyres click mechanic reckons this will be around ¬£700 (haven‚Äôt got any actual quotes yet but would be expecting more than this). 

It also desperately needs a service (its got 5 service stamps, but the last two were in 2017 and 2021).

I'd choose the Skoda or Seat over either of the BMWs. 

While the BMWs are great on motorways, you may find the suspension a little firm during general driving, especially in the M Sport models, which have a slightly stiffer setup. 

The Seat looks fairly good for the price, though bear in mind that with that mileage, the DSG gearbox should have had 2 services by now, Owners often overlook these services which can lead to issues. 

The Octavia VRS would be my top pick, subject to seeing the vehicle in person. I've actually owned one myself as my personal driver, while it's a manual model, it does have the cruise control option for motorway driving. The downside is that it's just coming up for its cambelt change (interval is 130k miles, with no age limit specified).

1o189kx,Please help :/,"I bought a 2010 BMW 116i (2.0 petrol, manual) from a dealer not long ago. I checked the car in person and it was perfect. When it was first delivered a week later, it had a coolant leak right away. The dealer arranged to have it taken back on a truck to get repaired ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt even get a chance to drive it properly. A week or so later they brought it back and said everything was sorted.

I asked for an invoice of work done to the car at that time, and they kept delaying me, even sending a random euro car parts invoice for injectors and coils which I never asked for and proves nothing as evidence, and in the end never ended up sending it. At first it was very very rough on startup and I called and they said to run it for a while since the fuel pump was changed. It did seem fine for a bit, but I noticed some white smoke and condensation from the exhaust, which they brushed off as normal. I also realised later that some of the car‚Äôs paperwork was missing ‚Äî including parts of the service history they‚Äôd claimed it had. The worst of it is papers for a replaced timing chain & clutch, which they claim to have spend ¬£1.6k on but again have sent me 0 proof or invoices or any documents of any work they have done on the car, which was promised to me before they sold it to me.

The car then sat unused for about a month since I was waiting for my insurance to start, but I have been running and idling it for at-least 15 minutes a day. Today I took it for a proper drive and filled it with ¬£50 of petrol. A few minutes later the check engine light came on, the car felt like it went into limp mode, then the light went off and came back flashing shortly after flashing.

When I checked, the code showed a Cylinder 2 misfire. There‚Äôs also a weird chirping/whirring noise from the engine bay, and popping/banging from the exhaust when I press the throttle at idle. The oil level‚Äôs fine, coolant looks okay, and the timing chain was replaced recently according to the dealer (again 0 ppw to prove even after this).

I‚Äôve got it booked in with my mechanic on Friday, but I‚Äôm honestly fed up ‚Äî between the coolant leak, the missing documents, and this new issue, it‚Äôs starting to feel like the dealer‚Äôs sold me a problem car. The main reason I bought this car was because it was sold to me as perfect with all big maintenance jobs done.
The dealer is refusing to take the car back and I really want this car gone, I specifically spent more money than I intended to just to have no problems, and in my opinion the lack of paperwork is enough to have a case. Ive added pictures of a letter ive drafted, is there a different way I should go about this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

1o14fj2,BMW 1 Series 116d Sport (2L),"Hi there. Apologies for what may seem a silly question for those of you that know more, this is my first decent car and BMW. I am just looking to understand why BMW would have a 2L engine with only 116bhp, the same as their other 116 model with a smaller engine. A stage 1 remap would bring it up to around 190 bhp which seems quite the leap and further makes me wonder why they‚Äôd keep such a powerful engine at bay.

The idea is that its the cheapest version of their cheapest car, where ""normal"" employees were given a 3 series the 116d would be given to trainees or apprentices. 

BMW could then put a de-tuned version of the engine that would go in a 120d or 118d and still make some money.

ShadowyModi (Score: 1): Insurance, engine & parts longevity

Tre1es (Score: 1): less powerful version lowers the price of entry opening up a wider market of potential buyers. Using a detuned version of an existing engine lowers the production costs and simplifies logistics again lowering costs. in essence its an effective way to widen you range of products without incresing your costs significantly.

  
Another great example of this is the V6 and V8 engines in JLR products where the engine blocks all start out the same"
1o14eth,How to check BMW 330e battery health?,"Hi, I just bought a used 2020 BMW 330e for ¬£14,500 with 80k miles. I am using the 3 pin plug to charge it and it takes about 5 and half hours to fully charge but it‚Äôs only giving me about 17-19 miles on full charge. I know batteries degrade over time but that seems way too low even for a used a car or am I wrong in expecting a bit more than 18 miles on full charge.  So I wanted to know how can I check the battery health? Like is there any OBD tool that I can use?

Let's so you get 20 miles from electric. And 20 miles per gallon from petrol.
Essentially you are getting discounted 20 miles.

1o13a3l,"I'm done with ""new"" cars","I've been looking for a reliable runaround that won't need taking to a garage and won't be throwing up random management lights. As the last vehicle I owned that threw up random lights ended up being scrapped despite being mechanically perfect as it needed a new ECU.

Our current modern and ""reliable"" diesel has needed about 4 grand spending on it in the past 18 months all under warranty thankfully

Looking at the market locally there was nothing that captured my interest

Fuel economy isn't really an issue as my commute is 8 miles and I fancied something that could tow stuff

Then this appeared

A 35 year old landrover 200Tdi Hi-Cap with a reasonable chassis and a bulkhead which isn't frilly

The most complex piece of electronics in it is the intermittent wipe feature on the windscreen wipers

The engine is 100% mechanical injection

I am a mechanical fitter to trade and there is ZERO on this ""car"" that bothers me. It needs a New Cross member at the back and I see that as a weekends worth of work

Oh and the heater is borked .... not that you would notice in a defender

It will be my winter runaround with it hopefully being replaced by an electric scooter/bike in the summer months

Have I made a bad move?
