1mip3i6,Diagnose Truck Starting Issue,"2005 Silverado SS, 218K 

I had my starter replaced with a brand new unit 5 years ago with the best OEM highest reviewed replacement. The original lasted 15 years.

When starting it, it sounds like it cranks 3-4 times and then starts. The engine and truck feel weak like it’s barely running for the first 30 seconds or so after the start and then it feels normal.

I had some battery issues this past winter but after jump starting it a few times and taking a few hour drive one night everything was back to normal since March. 

My aftermarket alarm system when back to factory reset which it only does when the battery dies but I didn’t have to jump it recently. This leads me to believe it’s more of a battery issue but the multiple cranks when starting it reminds me of when I got my starter replaced. It doesn’t click at all and the overall noise of the starter sounds normal but weaker if that makes sense.

Any ideas?

Hi everyone,
I’m dealing with a serious issue on my 2010 Tiguan with the 2.0 TSI (CCTA) engine.

Before a short 17 km drive, I checked the oil — the level was normal. But by the end of the trip, all the oil was gone. About 1 km before reaching my destination, I noticed a sudden and significant drop in engine power. When I arrived, the engine was still running smoothly, so I shut it off and didn’t try restarting.

Later that night, a friend tried to start the engine just to warm it up, not knowing there was no oil left. The engine didn’t start — he only attempted to start it once. Since then, the starter turns, but there’s zero compression in all cylinders.

🔧 Looking for advice from anyone with experience:
	•	What should I check first?
	•	Is a rebuild still an option?
	•	What components are most likely damaged?
	•	What’s the best approach to diagnose the problem without wasting unnecessary time or money?",1,1754436840.0,3,MechanicAdvice,1754509009,2025-08-05 23:34:00,2025-08-06 19:36:49,"RudbeckiaIS (Score: 1): How do you know there's zero compression? Did you compression test it?

1mioxz1,Steering wheel vibrations have been a pain to resolve. Help,"This has been a process... I'm defeated.
My 2005 Toyota 4Runner had a tirechange around 3-4 months ago, just a regular replacement when the last set was wearing. Well, after changing them, I immediately noticed a prominent shaking in my steering wheel when hitting 65mph. I got the wheels rebalanced, got another alignment, but nothing changed. I went to a road force shop to get a higher speed balance and they told me this set was actually out of round (to be fair, I did go with an economic brand) and I'd need to replace them. I did. The shaking persisted. He claimed that this second set was defective too. 
Sidenote: I got the rims checked at the same place, the rims are perfectly fine. 
Now today I replaced them with a new set for the THIRD time (Bridgestone this time) and the shaking still persists. I'm at a loss, and my mechanic seems to be too. He wants to check suspension next but is not optimistic that that will be the root cause.

Some other factors to consider: will a cheap filter stand up to any moisture or other degrading substances as well as OE? Does a cheap filter have a weird chemical smell? Does a cheap filter have noticeably less pleats and therefore will ""fill up"" faster? Is a cheap filter made from organic cellulose and attracts rodents?

There's also always the layer of ""is this unbelievably cheap Amazon listing even legit"" and ""will the part in the box be what's on the label"" etc.

I had the same thing happen on my '96 Chevy.

It is a hollow plastic ball and will float.

Realistic-March-5679 (Score: 1): So trying to find pictures of your fuel filler neck there’s a flap where the nozzle goes through. Is that still present? I have seen the flap break off, get lodged in the neck, and cause enough of a restriction to just pump fuel right out. The other common restriction is the vent valve, if it’s stuck closed the tank has no way of venting air which can cause a similar back up. Easiest way of testing this is is just remove the vent valve and then fill up, if it fills normally there’s your issue. Don’t leave it disconnected though, it’ll just leak fuel vapors into your engine bay and become a fire hazard. Occasionally the vent valve is on the charcoal canister so you may have to check there. There is a chance it’s your charcoal canister, especially if you often “top off” after the fuel nozzle auto stops. The charcoal canister can fill with liquid fuel and it  turns the charcoal from a fine powder to a sludge that air can not pass through simulating a bad vent valve but the vent valve isn’t getting air to vent. While there may be a vehicle specific thing those are three most common issues that can cause this."

Mechanic suggested we replace the spark plugs. Toyota manual recommends this at 120k miles, so in my mind we should have done this anyway so all good. He also recommended we replace all the ignition coils at once because if one is bad the others aren't too far behind and we'll save on labor doing them all at once. Made sense so I said yes to all of it. Cost \~$1100 for all that, oil change, and rotation.

He said the cause is almost certainly from the engine overheating, but I've never seen an engine temp warning, so I have no way of knowing how true that is.

   Ok so why the heck isn’t my freaking executor wire getting power?
  Fuse is fine. Was never blown. Says it’s the guages fuse… 
  I thought replacing the fuseable link with an inline fuse might solve it and once it reaches the alternator it would send power now that it has a place for the electricity to travel to. But no. Nothing. 
    WHAT DO IT DO when I fix this I have a car that’s all that’s wrong I’m 90% sure but u till I figure out this stupid issue I don’t have a car do I just run a new wire to it from something that turns on when the key is on? 

   Only other thing is that when I shorted my car when connecting battery… in the fusebox there were two wires plugged in withiught fuses in the batt acc terminals. The car wouldn’t turn on originally untill I pulled these two cables out of the fusebox. Then it turned on. Those two cables being pulled out was definitely the factor (only variable) that made the car turn on. 
   So I don’t know if the exciter wire was connected to one of these… 

  Idk if the bulb blew but it looks fine.  Is that it? Did the bulb blow? Will that fix my issue????? It worked fine… then two years ago the timing chain broke I replaced the timing chain last week but up untill the timing chain broke the alternator worked totally fine. So after I shorted the car something broke. Is it the bulb???? If it’s a guages fuse it’s fine. If it’s one of these fuseless wires then it was working withiught a fuse in- did it short the bulb? Did it mischievously burn some freaking wire that’s impossible to get to? What’s the deal? This should be simple. Ugh. I just need a car I just need a car so I can live my life

1mim7qp,Honda Civic 2015 heat shield fell off.,"I have a Honda Civic 2015, 1.8L four-cylinder engine. Recently the undercarriage began making a 'rattle'. I looked under it and it was clear something had fallen off and was hanging. Went to get my oil changed at Valvoline, please don't hate me I know nothing about cars it's convenient and easy, and asked them to investigate this mystery piece that was hanging and rattling on my exhaust pipe.

Turns out it was a heat shield. I've included an image in this post of that heat shield highlighted--not my actual vehicle but another of the same. I had the vehicle inspected a day ago and that the heat shield had already been removed--they didn't say anything about it. The Valvoline person told me they had, 'know a lot of people that just operate the vehicle without it'.

My major questions are:

What is the risk I am taking by not having this repaired immediately?

What is that small line that runs under the heat shield--which it seems to be protecting?

Would it be prudent to get it fixed ASAP--or am I being anxious for no reason?

Thanks for all the help!

2006 Ford 4.0 Mustang

Background:

Just finished up an “engine rebuild” after pulling the motor for a timing chain job. Car runs better than ever however I’ve noticed she’s leaving some oil spots in the driveway and garage when parked, and at stop lights I get a slight whiff of burning oil (probably dripping down onto the exhaust). Oil seems to be seeping from in between the bell housing and engine. I’m not an expert mechanic this is my first time pulling a motor and putting it back together. Google says it could be the rear main seal, however I replaced that and even bought a special tool to set the seal before we put the engine back in. Is there anything else that could be the culprit? Or is it most likely the rear main seal? I’m supposed to be taking this car from Chicago, IL to Dallas, TX in 2 weeks and want her to be in the best condition. I’m not loosing a terrible amount of oil, I’ve been driving the car for around 2 weeks and only noticed a slight difference in oil level on the dipstick. Do you think it would still be safe to take her down to Texas (with oil on hand in the trunk) or do you think this is a more serious problem? I’ve seen some “rear main seal repair” oil additives but I assume those are all just snake oil placebo. I don’t have time to drop the trans and/or pull the motor again before I leave for this trip. Any suggestions would be appreciated ❤️

I'm absolutely at my wits' end trying to resolve a NASTY drivetrain vibration for the past few months. Every 20-30 minutes of driving (any speed) it will start to feel like driving over rumble strips, then gradually get more intense until it feels like the entire front end is falling apart, rattling me and any passengers. It gets so unbearable I'm nearly being bounced out of my seat and does not stop unless I come to a FULL stop. After stopping, it doesn't come back for another 20-30 minutes of driving. It doesn't seem to happen at any particular speed or acceleration, but the magnitude of the vibration is worse at higher speeds. It continues vibrating if shifted to neutral while at speed.

SIX different shops have looked at it: one dealer, one t!re shop, one transmission shop, and three independent mechanics.  Every single one has been ""unable to recreate issue"" test driving. The driveshafts and CVs have been taken out and inspected, no issues, all of the brakes and wheel bearings have been done, the t!res dismounted rotated and thoroughly inspected, transmission fluid tested, suspension and bushings looked over, differentials serviced, all have had ZERO indication of any kind of problem. I would question my own sanity, but four other people (NOT mechanics) have driven the car and felt exactly what I described. No mechanic can seem to replicate it.

I recently traded my 07 Matrix for a 23 Civic.

That's a lot of money.. so finally I traded it, put money down, and got myself the newer Civic.

1mi3ful,Effectiveness of moderate weight reduction on daily,"So, this is not a ""I WANNA GO FASTER ON THE DRAGSTRIP!!!"" kinda deal. I've got a very old car with a 1.4 engine that puts out a measly 60hp which is probably down to a 50 or less after all these years. It's well maintained and has no other issues but it bums me out that if you even dare look at an uphill it just bogs down and you've got to rev the nuts off it in 2nd or even 1st to make it up a steep hill.

Now since it's an old car and I mainly use my motorcycle, I will not be going down the psycho road of spending money like it's monopoly cash to get carbon fiber everything and lightweight calipers just to improve straight line acceleration by 0.002%.

I'd much prefer something practical, not too pervasive and of course, without spending anything. There's no point getting lightweight alloys (it's got 14"" steelies now) that'll cost me at best 500euros when the car costs about 2000!

So the question is, would it make any noticeable difference if I just get rid of the spare wheel (it's one of those ""minis""), most of the heavy tools I've got in there along with various liquids (oil, coolant, brake fluid etc.). Basically, would emptying the trunk improve anything noticeably?

I won't be removing the AC piping and the hydraulic steering nor do I want to start ripping off the sound deadening or door cards or whatever. It's a daily and I use it on road trips too and I value creature comforts more than speed.

I just don't want the poor thing to struggle so much uphill, especially with more passengers.

P.S. I already know about the driver's weight reduction option so let's not bring this up please.

P.S.2 I know the most obvious answer is to sell and get something a bit more powerful but considering I've been trying to sell it for more than a year without any success and I'm not willing to go too low on price, I'm searching for alternatives as stated above, until I can find a buyer at least.

NickRMX6 (Score: 2): Since it's power/weight ratio that matters for acceleration and climbing hills, a 1% reduction in weight is equivalent to a 1% increase in power. Either would give you a (roughly) 1% increase in acceleration, (""roughly"", because I'm ignoring stuff like wind resistance, friction etc.).

Edit: but it's a bit more complicated with wheels, because of rotational inertia. A 1lb reduction in the weight of the wheels is equivalent to somewhere between 1lb and 2lb reduction in the weight of the car body.

All of these would have no more than 65k miles, and cost no more than $16k (April 2027 projected prices). Are these a good idea? I don't want to spend more than $2k a year on maintenance but can DIY some regular maintenance things.

1mi8c3d,Water sloshing noise in car after radiator replacement,"Hello! I’d like somebody’s opinion on this. I got my radiator replaced twice in my 2021 Jeep Cherokee Latitude Lux. I had originally brought it into the shop for a water sloshing noise behind the dash, and they told me that I needed a new radiator. 

The first radiator they installed had a major leak in it and the way I found this out was from my engine overheating light coming on the dashboard. I drove it back to them and they claimed that the engine didn’t sustain any damage because it had happened when my car was on an uphill incline, meaning coolant was still in the engine. First of all, is this statement correct at all? 

Keep in mind when they had installed the first radiator the noise had gone away until the engine overheating light came on. Then, when the second radiator was installed, the noise returned. I drove it back to them multiple times/called them complaining about the noise and they told me that it should go away within 100 miles. When it doesn’t go away at 100 miles, I call them again and they claim it should go away if I drive it on the freeway more. Are either of these claims correct?? Because as far as I’ve looked up online they aren’t. 

I’ve also looked up online what the issue could be, and multiple sources have mentioned that the “system was not bled correctly” which caused air to be trapped in the system. Is this correct? What should I tell the shop? I’m driving it back there today.",1,1754398271.0,3,carquestions,1754509009,2025-08-05 12:51:11,2025-08-06 19:36:49,"CuppieWanKenobi (Score: 2): There is, as you have surmised, air in the heater core.

The pads are at 4mm. Shop reports rotors are ""near end of life.""

We came in afraid there was a transmission issue because it seemed to get soft-stuck at a low RPM for several seconds before finally accelerating. Partner reported it was bad enough to make entering the highway safely occasionally difficult.

Shop reported that actually our calipers were overheating (some words to that effect) and therefore sticking, and that was causing the acceleration difficulty.

They said that the hose is the real issue, such that doing everything else but not the hoses will only be a temporary fix at best, but I didn't get much more detail than that at the time. (They also said they're having a lot of trouble finding the right hoses but that they're now on some ""lists"" should some become available.)

You can do a load test with just a multimeter. Check battery voltage with engine running, should be 14-14.5 volts. Then turn on headlights, high beams, hazards, AC, rear window defrost, radio, and check battery voltage. If voltage drops below 13.5, alternator is probably going bad.

Customer states check engine light on. Recently had 02 Sensors, Spark Plugs, Coil Packs, MAF Sensor, and Some gaskets replaced. CEL is still present.

Customer states they've installed a K&N filter into the OEM filter box. Customer also states that Midas recently reconnected a loose fuel line, as well as that they are using 87/89 octane fuel instead of Recommended 91 for vehicle. Has had several shops inspect and replace parts however, the same CEL returns. Inspect and Advise.

After initial inspection and OEM system scan the computer presented with codes P0174 - System too lean bank 2, P2A03 - 02 Sensor Circuit Range Performance Bank 2 Sensor 1. Tech Noted black soot collected around the exhaust pipe meaning the system is running rich and burning fuel poorly. Customer also stated that soot had been blowing out of the vehicle and onto the garage floor upon startup. No driveability issues however live data showed that the post cat O2 sensor was at a STFT of 99.2%. Bank 1 fuel trims were normal at a STFT of +-1.6% and a LTFT of +-2.3%. Bank 2 fuel trims were abnormal with a STFT of +-23.6% and a LTFT of +-44.2%. Downstream O2 sensor were both showing a FT of 99.2% with no changes. Suspected a failure in the bank 2 upstream O2 system and begin to inspect. Noted that the B1S1 and B2S1 O2 sensors showed a voltage rating of 3.2-3.5V. Voltage for O2S is rated at Min .035 & Max .0835. B1S2 and B2S2 were within normal voltage range.

Suspected contaminated MAF from oil on K&N filter was causing incorrect readings. MAF readings (warm engine): Engine off: \~0.20 lb/min, Idle: 0.8–1.16 lb/min, 2500 RPM: 2.87–3.56 lb/min, WOT snap: peak \~6.75 lb/min. Upon a visual inspection, and a vacuum leak test with brake cleaner around the engine hoses no vacuum leak was detected. MAF was not contaminated and inner breather hoses were clean of any oils. MAF was reading out of spec but is not suspected as the main problem for customers CEL.

The high fuel trims are isolated to bank 2. Bank 1 fuel trims are within standards. Suspected incorrect O2S installed however upon verification OEM fit O2S are currently on the vehicle, could not verify correct part number because of vehicle temperature. The abnormal upstream voltages suggest a faulty O2S, or a signal circuit fault. Potential exhaust leak but not confirmed onsite.

Don’t know much about cars at all despite having a license for years. I’m in Europe and 90% of vans like that are diesel which is understandable since they’re usually utilised by companies. However my sister-in-law bought a Peugeot Partner and converted it to a mc and now she’s having tons of issues with AdBlue. I’m reading a lot of crap about AdBlue elsewhere as well. 


The issue is that on the daily basis there wouldn’t that much driving other than getting groceries and going to the train station (both me and my husband work 150 km from where we live and taking the train is cheaper than driving). We will be going on several long haul trips a year and then semi long ones on weekends. Probably not much road trips in winter though. From what I heard diesels have to be well used to stay healthy especially with all the add-ons. Wonder if this is why SIL is having issues with hers, she barely uses it on the daily. 



Petrol engines are rare to find in vans but not impossible, so I wonder if that could be the better solution? But then I also keep hearing how they’re less efficient and have less torque. Our build won’t be super heavy though so maybe it’s fine? Feels like all the extra we’re gonna pay for loading up would be far outweighed by service fees for AdBlue issues (SIL just paid a hefty price for injection issue).

I was trying to change the region of the head unit from Japan to Europe/USA so I could use features like navigation and radio more easily. While attempting the change, the unit locked itself and is now showing the anti-theft protection screen, completely bricked.

I tried paying someone to retrieve the anti-theft code through the Mercedes-Benz database, but I’ve been told the code is not available in their system — probably because it’s a Japanese import. I really don’t have the budget to replace the whole unit, and I’m trying to fix this as affordably as possible.

I’m based in Dubai, UAE, so if anyone local knows someone who can:

	•Retrieve the anti-theft code for a JDM NTG 4.5
	•Bypass or unlock the unit
	•Or flash it back to stock/reset the region

… please reach out. Any kind of advice, tool, or connection would be super appreciated. 🙏

1miobh2,Is this a real brake issue?,"Hi All,

Kind of a long series of events but I want you’re take on this situation.

Initial Situation:
My gf (26F) got a recall notice on her 2017 Toyota RAV4 for the battery support bars. So she took it in for the recall to a Toyota dealership and while there asked them to do a multipoint inspection, since we live in a state that doesn’t do yearly inspections, and she hasn’t had it inspected since she bought the car 2.5 years prior. The car was purchased certified pre-owned from a Toyota dealership in another state. Keep in mind, there were no problems or issues with the car when it was brought in. 

1st Time Back (A few hours later):
When she went back to get it, they said that they were having trouble getting the brake pedal to bounce back from the floor after inspecting the brake pads and calipers. They said they would need more time to figure it out. 

2nd time back (3 Days later):
They called her and said that the brake fluid had a contaminate in it and damaged all of the components in the system and everything needs replaced including Master Cylinder, seals, all brake lines, all calipers, and the ABS actuator (~$5000). They said that it was contaminated with an oily substance, wouldn’t mix with water, and they ended up with a “milky appearance”. We asked where the contaminate could have come from and they said it likely was just sitting on top of the brake reservoir and when they were messing with the calipers during the inspection it got pushed through the system. The thing is that she hasn’t anything done to the car except oil changes and tire rotations from local mechanic shops (not quick lube places) in the past 2.5 years  so we aren’t buying that the contaminate has just been sitting on top of the reservoir without causing issues for 2.5 or more years. 

3rd Time Back (1 Day later):
She called corporate to ask for the car to be moved to another mechanic. They sent a tow truck, which took 6+ hours, and it was taken to the local shop that she gets the oil changes and such from. 

4th Time (1 Day Later):
The local place flushed the brake fluid system and said that there was a contaminate but they just flushed it all out and don’t see any other issues (~$180). 

5th time (Today):
The car brakes seem to not be holding pressure when fully stopped for a period of time and the car creeps forward. We are going to ask the local shop to bleed them again and check the system. 

In dealing with the complaint, my gf was put back in touch with the dealership which basically said that she shouldn’t trust the brake system and is likely for an accident now. My gf doesn’t trust the car anymore and doesn’t know what to do and or what has happened. Are the repairs the dealership listed valid? Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

Technician Notes from the Toyota Dealership
1. During multipoint inspection Technician noted that the front brakes would not spin freely - suspected front brake concern
2. Technician removed front wheels and brake calipers - brake pads measured 5mm (service limit 3mm)- caliper pistons + slide pins moved freely - no concern found with calipers/brake pads
3. Technician recommended front brake pad replacement and a brake fluid exchange to correct concern with front wheels.
4. Guest sent estimate with repairs - declined service
5. Upon reassembly of brakes technician noted the brake pedal had no pressure - went directly to the floor
6. Technician attempted a bleed/flush brake system - no fluid would bleed from brake system - further inspection of brake fluid determined an unknown contaminate in brake fluid - possible petroleum based fluid (would not mix with water)
7. Due to incompatible fluid introduced into brake system - All rubber based components require replacement due to swelling

1mioa3m,Scammed & not sure what to do,"TLDR:
I purchased a new battery and alternator 8 months ago and now neither are working properly. I found out they replaced my alternator with a refurbished one and a battery that was sitting on the shelf for months. Meineke is refusing to honor their warranties. I need help on what to do.

I know I was scammed, but I just don’t know what I can do if anything. Around 8 months ago I moved to Colorado from PA. I had battery/power issues a few days after I got here and took my car (2007 Saturn Ion) to a local Meineke as that’s where I went back in PA. It would also allow this Meineke access to my car’s history.
I was told the battery and alternator needed replaced. Ok, signed off on that. Just under $1000 later… Now, for the past 2 months I’m having power issues again and find out the following:
1. The ‘new battery’ had been sitting on the shelf for 3-4 months prior to being installed.
2. The alternator they put in was refurbished, not new like we were told.
3. I never gave permission or was even asked, let alone had it mentioned to me for a refurbished part to be installed.
4. Was charged for a new alternator with a 130% mark up and 4 times the labor cost of how long it should have/did take to install.
5. The managers kept denying the used alternator/cost for that, but never argued about the fact the over charged for labor.
Also-
6. It has cost me so much in other services (grocery delivery, uber, etc.) as my car would be jumped one day and the very next, it was dead again and I couldn’t get to appointments and so forth.

When I brought this up with the Meineke, my mother and I were talked down to and just insulted the entire time. We were told that ‘new alternators were not being made anymore for my make/model of car’ and a 30 sec. google search and a call to an Auto parts store proved that wrong. Once called out on it, the manager said it was the one they had in the store. There was an auto parts store not 30 feet from the Meineke. Every time a lie or bs answer was given, it took me less than five minutes to prove that wrong. And then I was given another BS excuse/lie where they were just trying to get rid of me. A lot of these issues were brought to my attention by the AAA mechanic that came over to tow my car to the Meineke. Both parts were under the 1 year warranty. The AAA guy said that the ‘refurbished alternator’ may have been a refurbished one they put in, but with the rust and look of it, he couldn’t be sure if it was even changed or not.

It took A LOT of arguing to get them to give me a new and working battery. They are still refusing to do anything with the alternator as they said ‘it’s passed their tests’. 
I am trying to get a refund for my alternator as I not only paid for a new one (over paid in my opinion), never signed off on a refurbish one. I never get refurbished parts as I drive across country a few times a year by myself. With my health issues, it’s too dangerous to risk it. I am not even sure what they said about the alternator working is true. I know those codes can be deleted from what I have researched, and I really don’t trust them to put in a new one at all. 
As of right now, they aren’t willing to do anything with the alternator. No refund, no new part installed, etc. With how much they have tried to gaslight, lie, insult and talk down to me and my mother, I just wanted my warranty honored. Now, I want to be done with them. I paid nearly $700+ for the used part.

I don’t know what I can do, if anything. I do have a print out of my alternator not properly working from AAA mechanic. I know there is going to social media and showing the evidence I have that I was lied to and was never given the parts I paid for. Showing that they refuse to honor the warranties, but I don’t have a large following. The store manager also kept saying that a new alternator would cost much much more, but this is after I called the manager out on lying about the part not being made anymore. 

I know this is kind of all over the place and there are many more details to this messed up situation, but I need help. I need to know what, if anything I can do. If there are companies that could oversee things like this. The man I am now dealing with is the district manager and while he is not as horrible as the store manager, he is awful.

Any help or advice would be appreciated. If more information is needed, just ask and I can give as much about the situation as I have.

I have a 2014 Ford Fiesta that has had numerous warranty extensions on a few parts in its powertrain, the problem I'm having now being that the TCM is being defective. Had it towed to the nearest Ford dealer and they are telling me that they do not see any extended coverages/recalls for the vehicle whatsoever not even expired, which is strange to me considering I have a letter I'm staring at with my vin number saying that there was coverage at one point. They gave me a quote to replace the TCM. So I called ford directly and was told that because the warranty expired June 30th this year (Customer Satisfaction Program 14M02) that there is nothing that they can do for me and that they can't make an exception for me in this scenario. They said that they would send a complaint case to their internal affairs who would then conduct an investigation, I doubt that will go anywhere though.

However, the caveat in this scenario is that I went to a ford dealer under the same franchise, in a different town when I was having issues with the same exact part a year ago. I took it in to my local Big O, and they read the engine code and told me that it was the TCM and that I needed to take it into a dealer to have it replaced. I started driving the car to the dealer, and noticed that for whatever reason they decided to clear the engine code. When I got to the dealer, I told them my symptoms I.E. stuttering/shuddering/ inconsistent acceleration, and that the check engine light came on. The dealer said ""OH, that sounds like your TCM! we should be able to get it replaced for you as it's still under warranty."" Then he asked if the check engine light was still on and I said ""No, I took it in to another shop and they told me that the engine code indicated some issues with the TCM, but when I got into my car the light was off so they decided to clear it for whatever reason."" and the dealer's response was: ""Oh, well because the engine code isn't present anymore, there is nothing we can do to help you. The engine code must be present in order for us to replace it under warranty, so just drive it until the check engine light comes back on, then bring it back in.""

So I did just that, drove the thing around until the light came on and I had issues with it again, and miraculously the thing lasted a whole year before having issues, conveniently past the time of warranty lol. Am I SOL or is there anything else I can do to try and get ford, or the franchise to cover the cost of the replacement?

I was considering going to the dealer I went to initially that told me to drive it until the light came back on to ask for a records of all my service requests.

These recommendations are usually open to some flexibility, but the Tire Industry Association is widely accepted by dealers and manufacturers as setting the ""industry standard"" here... [https://www.tireindustry.org/resources/consumer-education/consumer-safety-overview/tire-replacement/](https://www.tireindustry.org/resources/consumer-education/consumer-safety-overview/tire-replacement/)

>I am only replacing two tires, where should they be mounted?

>While the best practice is to replace all four tires, when replacing only two tires, the new tires should be installed on the rear of the vehicle. If the new tires are installed on the front axle with worn tires on the rear, then the vehicle may be more likely to lose control when turning in wet or slippery conditions.

This can be debated all day... I grew up being taught you put them on the drive axle... This is what the shop I worked at taught in the 1980's and early 1990's... then it changed to being recommended on the rear regardless of drive type.

The Internet is full of people's thoughts and ideas and test results, but almost every tire shop will put them on the rear because that is the recommended industry standard... they don't want to put them on the front, then you get in an accident that could somehow be related to oversteer, then go back and sue them. If they put them on the front, a lawyer could argue the shop didn't the follow industry standards of putting them on the rear of the vehicle and the shop is liable for the damages of an accident. Where if the shop put them on the rear it would be much harder to make a case the shop was liable for the accident. Really that's what it boils down to, the craziness of todays lawsuit happy society.

1mig4bo,$2768 for front struts???,"I got my car serviced a couple weeks ago and received a failure on the front struts leaking and squeaking. I had brought my car in months prior (at a different dealership) for a recall and they didn’t find anything wrong with it. They are going to look at it again right now, but even if they are bad I am definitely not going through with it at this location. 

I had to do a triple take when they quoted me for the price (I thought I heard wrong) and this whole process has been really unorganized (I called last week and apparently the lady I talked to never even ordered the parts even though she said she would which is why she scheduled me for the next week 💀). She also said she would send me the quote which I asked for on the call, and never got contacted with a price (probably bc she forgot to order the parts 💀💀💀).

A different worker is helping me today and I would need to wait until tomorrow since they don’t have the parts. She gave me a quote for my ACURA MDX 2017, about $400 for each front strut ($800 total) and an insane amount for labor and alignment. She said it would take about 3-4 hours for the labor, so maybe I should become an acura mechanic to earn $500-600/hr. Absolute bonkers.

A few ugga duggas is exactly how it’s done, and it’ll spring back a little bit. 1000s of pinion seals get done daily with counting the rotations, getting it close, listening to the impacts tone change and by feel.

Anyways what's the duration of your pulse width to your fuel injector #3 ??  If it's too long or short the amount of fuel will cause a misfire.  Your camshaft position sensor reads the location of the camshaft which is read by the engine computer and then the PCM outputs fuel injector pulse width.  If the signal being read by the camshaft position sensor is too short or missing for cylinder #3 that cylinder will get less or no fuel actually being injected. New injectors or old only do what they are told. Is it holding fuel pressure ok ? Maybe injector #3 is stuck open a little causing to much fuel and a misfire. 

Was the compression on cylinder #3 identical to the others ? +/- 3psi? 

I would take out spark plug #1 and #3 and visually compare spark, make sure they look the same, a failing PCM driver will have a weaker spark, ohm out each of the #3 coil wires and compare to a working cylinder.  The crankshaft position sensor is responsible for spark timing and depending on its position will fire a certain cylinders spark Via the PCM will trigger that ignition coil. If the signal trigger wire for #3 has high resistance or a voltage drop it will cause a weak spark or delayed spark event both causing a misfire."

1mi0qgl,Car dealer found engine problems in the middle of closing the deal for the car I want. They're fixing it (replacing two lifters). Did I get lucky or am I getting screwed?,"2014 camry SE (2.5L 4cyl 6A), 125k miles, no accidents, clean title report. It's a small used dealership with no in-house financing, they bought this at a carmax auction, didn't need any repairs.

I inspected it myself and made a point to listen to the engine with the hood up; it sounded good. During my test drive I took it to O'reilly's and got it scanned, nothing came up. So dealer and I discussed the price and began the process of paying. Meanwhile the maintenance guy took the car to get washed for me; that's when he heard engine knocking and interrupted us. He showed me and that time I heard it (btw the same guy drove it earlier to fill gas while I was there, he didn't hear it then). So they got to work opening it up to diagnose while I finished up with the salesman. Before I left for the day they determined 2 lifters were bad and they could replace them by tomorrow morning.

Again, I was literally in the middle of paying. I was going to pay mostly cash and the remainder with zelle ($2600, the bank was closed and my debit card has low withdrawal limits). He counted the cash on the table and then I sent the zelle payment; shortly afterwards we were interrupted. Got my cash back, but because the zelle hadn't finished processing yet they wouldn't refund that. I was in the mindset that this is the car I'm buying, it's just a simple fix and it'll be good again, so I was ultimately convinced to let the zelle payment become the deposit and signed a statement saying ""I agree to pay 2600 as deposit and understand under no circumstances is it refundable"". I did get him to agree to an addendum I wrote, ""except in the event of a collision, major damage or major repairs before purchasing"", if that's worth anything. All my attention was on the ""no circumstances"" part of the contract, only after I left did I consider what might be obvious: what if the 2 lifters are a sign that the engine has more problems that won't show up until later?

I'm new at this and don't know if I'm being overly paranoid or made a stupid mistake. I'm in a position where I'm really motivated to either finish this deal or cancel and find another car asap. But should I be thinking about canceling, can I even get my deposit back? Should I just get a warranty (not through the dealer, would find a well-recommended one)? Should I pay for a 3rd party engine inspection? Dealer doesn't allow off-site inspections, but they allow mobile mechanics to come and inspect it.

Before you say immediate red flag, I trusted them at the time because they didn't have to stop the deal. They could have just let me pay the full price, given me the title and let me find out for myself, when it would be my problem. It would have been sold As-is. They offered GWC warranty but weren't pushy, I didn't take it. I tried to think how the mechanic could be lying but couldn't think of a reason. He said multiple times to the salesman, ""we can't sell it like this"".

The noise seems to def increase\be tied to vehicle speed more than engine RPM, and is worse when coasting vs under load. At higher vehicle speeds it changes from a rattle\grind to a high pitched whir (~1min in the video). Listening under the car, it sounds like it's coming from the side of the transmission farthest from the bellhousing\clutch. I'm guessing a bearing on the input\output shaft or something grenaded itself into forbidden glitter...anything else I should check before I drain the trans and check for sparkles and start hunting for a replacement trans?"

1mhvced,Advice on driving with a bad intake manifold,"I have a 2009 Volkswagen Tiguan with 120,000 miles that has a rough idle from a bad intake manifold. 

I refuse to get it fixed because I’m at the point where I’ve spent at least $1500 a year fixing it for the past 4 years. I even got a new intake manifold in July 2024, so there’s just no end to it. At this point my partner and I have determined it’s our “burner” car and will just ride it out until it doesn’t ride anymore. 

However, we have a 405 mile roadtrip coming up this week and are trying to decide if we should take the Tiguan or our new car to save its miles. We’re at the point where if the Tiguan breaks down, it breaks down, we just don’t want it to kill us lol.

I brought it to the mechanic explaining the symptoms and said I assumed spark plugs or maybe fuel system issues merely because Ive had similar symptoms in other cars which turned out to be related to those things. The mechanic called me about 30 mins after I dropped it off and said the issue was likely the alternator due inconsistent voltage reading, he said when the voltage reading dropped the misfire was heard. I was skeptical because I’ve never had an alternator issue show up with these symptoms, but if the alternator was failing I figured it would be better to replace it before it became a real problem anyway, so said go for it. 

I Picked up the car after hours and started it to find it’s having the same issue that I brought it in with. The misfire is slightly better, it seems less frequent, but all the original symptoms are still there. 

Other notable things about the car is that it had timing belt done 75,000, new radiator recently and serpentine belt, but don’t know much history before that. Leaks a bit of oil between changes, but nothing too noteworthy I kept it topped off as needed.

Phantom misfire after recent thourough service performed at 101k miles, nonissue prior to that. Only happens at higher speeds (45+) and at lower rpms while pulling in-gear. When gassed enough to downshift, the misfire goes away. Thank you for your time and any suggestions.***

Greetings all, first time poster here. I apologized for the long post but in order to give you the most information I need to drop the backstory. About 1-2 months ago my car hit 100k miles, and has been well maintaind by me until then. I decided ro do a nice big 100k tune up, and spent almost $1700 on several things including spark plugs (full list in comments). After the service, the vehicle started what felt like the transmission slipping when driving in top gear while at speeds above 45-50 and in a lower RPM.

Got recommended to a solid independant transmission shop by my usual independant, and he quickly desuced that the transmission is fine, and its a misfire. He was able to pull a couple codes, all misfires. One for random misfire, and 2 cylinder specific misfires, 4 and 5. Prior to having the big 100k mile service done, I never had this issue. I took it back to my shop, and they warrantied all the spark plugs, checked the gaps and also swapped ignition coils around, issue still persisted however no check engine light or codes. I also did an induction cleaning then at their recommendation and still nothing. This shop is very reputable and ive never had an issue with them, they arent a stealership and I believe they know what they are doing for the most part. I dont know what they would have messed up to cause the issue, but again it wasnt happening before the big service.

After the warranty work and induction cleaning and the issue persisted, they looked at it and road tested again free of charge, but again no codes to read and no lights. The mechanic recommended a valve cleaning, but they dont do that there so they recommended me to another independant. After talking to him, hes not so sure the walnut blast will fix it and didnt want me to waste my money. His opinion leaned more towards injectors rather than just dirty valves

I want to continue driving this car for years, so I dont want to leave the issue unaddressed but without any codes and the misfire only happening at lower rpms (never idle) at speed, I dont want to fire the parts cannon at it only for the issue to persist. Do any of you have experience fixing the GM 3.6 with a phantom misfire under the described operating conditions?

The car only cost $12000 when bought and ive gotten 70k good miles out of it. Been paid off for years, and I dont want to buy a new one at the prices these days if I can help it. Its got some body damage from a tree falling on part of the bumper and tree sap all over the roof so its not worth anything to trade or sell, im debating wether to just drive it till the wheels fall off or spend over $1k more to *maybe* fix the issue.

I've got quotes to get it sorted but they are around 2k for parts inc labour. Bearing in mind I only bought the car for 3k and it needs an mot in Oct. 

Now my question is, do I sink 2-2.5k into it to get it sorted or do I get rid and buy something else? 

I do love the car, it has fantastic mpg (currently around 60mpg as I do 50miles+ a day motorway), its nippy and drives fantastic but my brain is telling me its a bad financial decision to put almost as much money as the car is worth into it to fix it, even more so with an mot upcoming in a month or 2. 

Then there is the issue of if I decided to buy another car, I'd want one perhaps more reliable/cheaper to fix, that gets decent milage out of it. My budget being 2-3k for that.   

I'd apreciate what you guys think about my issue.

1midw02,BMW servicing costs - am I being naïve?,"Got a quote from my local dealer to do an oil and filter, and drain and refill the diff oil. Oil change was £235 and diff was £180. Compared to quotes from other dealers and specialists this is pretty cheap, not gonna complain about that!

However, I also asked for a quote to change the coolant. £615! Is this how much it costs these days? I know the process is quite complicated and requires special tools. Maybe that's why BMW says it's lifetime...

They also said they can't add the service to iDrive because it'll 'confuse the car'. Car is telling me it'll go 20k between oil changes, obviously not going to do that. It's done about 8k since it was last changed. This is fine but I can foresee a problem in another 8k miles' time, when it has 4k remaining but I want to change the oil.

1midp1m,Dealer says he'll cover the cost of work. Should I trust?,"Please help a car newbie out. 

I just bought my first car from a local dealership. I noticed on the test drive the air-con didn't work and the dealer said he'd get it fixed as part of the pre-sale agreement. He then delivered the car and provided a receipt of the 'air-con check and re-gas' by a local garage. The air-con however still doesn't work. 

It's not covered by my warranty as it's effectively pre-existing. I told the dealer and he reluctantly said over text he will cover the costs of the fix. 

I don't think it will be an easy cheap fix as the local garage obviously didn't manage to fix it. I'm worried he might just not pay once the work is done. Should I go ahead and get the work done or just ask for a refund and start the car hunt again?

As for why, there’s demand for cheap-ish ULEZ compliant cars and <18 year old petrol and hybrids fit the bill. New UK market cars at the time were often diesel but these are plentiful in japan. Some models like the Jazz/Fit hybrid sold poorly here at the time (it was just over the magic 99g/km CO2) but make more sense now as a used buy. Things like the Toyota hybrids at the cheaper end of the UK market are shagged ex-taxis. There’s also some premium stuff like BMWs and Volvos coming over too, Japan would buy petrol and often spec them up when here it was a lot of basic spec diesel remobiles. 

They’re cheap to buy in Japan, if they’re over 10 years old then only need a fog light and MOT. Like anything else there are cheap dodgy dealers selling cars cheap which could well be accident damaged or clocked, there are others selling decent stock at fair prices. You can get a carvx check which will flag things like that and usually auction details when it sold in japan.

There really doesn't seem to be any business out there repairing undercarriage rust for modern cars.

Please let me know your opinions on the cheapest, quickest method to calm this rust down and seal for for at least a few years. There's rust on all the suspension parts, in particular the rear, rear axle is pretty bad but still feels solid to me, can't put a screwdriver through it. Struts are bad but past an MOT, will need replacing anyway as they're knackered. Seems like the mainly surface rust to me but the mechanic said the car's got about 3/4 years left if nothing is done. Biggest problem areas seem to be around the axle mount points and the rear axle itself (which looks like it can be replaced as an alternative?).

  
If I remove as much rust as possible with a wire wheel drill bit and use some rust converter, then paint with underseal will this do the job?

First of all it's the distance selling regulations in the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and yes it would.

> Does the payment need to be made online for those protections to apply?

Yes. The only exception to this when paying in person is where you're not able to examine goods or an identical item before paying for them, buying in an Argos store falls under this because you look for the item in a catalogue, they're not in the store for you to view.

1mi2vhd,Charged £510–£570 for ABS sensor issue + AC regas — Fair or getting ripped off?,"Hey everyone, reposting again because I noticed I left some points. I’m looking for some advice on whether I’ve overpaid or if this is pretty standard for a UK garage.

I bought a a left rear ABS sensor off eBay (~£30) and took it to a local garage for fitting. They quoted me £180 for labour to remove the old sensor and fit the new one.
They mentioned the sensor screw was seized and it looked like someone had already tried replacing it. For context, my brother (a mechanic) had come to my house the day before to replace it but forgot a specific tool and couldn’t finish the job — he lives quite far, so I decided to take it to a garage instead.

They fitted the eBay sensor for the agreed £180 labour, but the ABS warning light remained on. The mechanic explained it could be because the sensor wasn’t OEM or possibly due to a fault elsewhere in the ABS circuit. They said further diagnosis would cost extra.
At that point, I told them I’d just pay the £180 and take the car to a Honda dealership instead. After I said that, they offered to take another look.

They spent about 2–3 hours testing — comparing the faulty sensor’s readings with the other three. wheels, checking power, signal, etc. Eventually, they found that there was a gap between the sensor and the hub, unlike the other sides, and said this was likely the cause of the issue.

They suggested ordering a genuine Honda sensor, and I agreed. 

Current Charges:
£180 – Labour for fitting the eBay sensor.
£100 – Extra for diagnostics, testing, and re-fitting the genuine Honda part.
£130 – AC gas refill I requested while the car was in
They also said the OEM Honda ABS sensor might cost £200–£250, but they’re confirming the price today.

So... am I getting ripped off? Or is this a fair price for the work and time involved at a decent UK garage? My car is Honda civic 1.5, 2019. 
Would love to hear if others have had similar jobs done or if this seems a bit high.

Apologies for long post.

This is the risk you run with ebay parts - the garage will still want their time paid for, it’s not on them that the part was crap because they didn’t supply it. 

They’ve followed a pretty reasonable set of steps - most (proper) garages will be in the region of £65-120 depending where you are. Round my parts most independents are £90 ph at the low end.
