Three years ago it’s sort of ran, but was showing some signs of not perfect perfectly running. But it sat in the jungle and definitely got some heavy rains. I assume it’s just a carburetor issue. I recently took out the carb, cleaned it out, put it back in and got it to start, somewhat idle, and rev up pretty good. 

I found that the clutch was stuck and so went through the recommended procedures of getting it unstuck by getting it into gear holding the clutch and getting up some speed and then slamming down on the rear break to try to free the clutch. 

I did it four or five times slamming pretty hard and it will not unstick, so I began to drain the oil to see about digging farther into it…. 

That’s when I saw the milkshake. The coolant in the radiator still looks clear and green and was all the way to the very top. So my guess is water contamination, but I haven’t opened it up yet.

 Head gasket, crack in cylinder head, crack in block OR faulty EGR cooler.

1nh5c8c,Advice on broken brake,"I brought my car in almost 2 weeks ago to get it checked out before a road trip (Chicago to Michigan). It’s a 2010 Honda CRV. They advised replacing the front and back brake pads and rotors, which they did. Coming back from my trip, I heard a sound like something fell or I hit something, but nothing more for a couple minutes. That’s when the grinding started. I had experienced something similar with worn down brake pads in the past and figured it was the brakes, so I pulled off the highway asap. 

I checked out the wheels, but I really don’t have a ton of knowledge on cars and couldn’t see anything wrong. I took the side streets home going as slow as possible, luckily we were at least back in the city by then. After I parked and got out at home, this is how the back left wheel looked. Obviously, this was the grinding I heard. 

I asked my brother who is not a pro but has worked on cars. He said the caliper is coming off, causing it to scrape against the inside of the wheel. Likely the bolt wasn’t torqued down right or was forgotten entirely. He suggested the shop should tow it in, but also said I should post here. 

The shop I took it to, which I did like up until now, gave me a warranty so I assume they’ll fix the caliper and the wheel if needed, and they should probably tow it in. 

I’m just wondering if there’s anything we’re missing or what else any of y’all might suggest?  Should I ask another shop to check it out after it’s fixed again? I’m not sure I trust them anymore.

  You have the right to be mad, as it definitely impacts the road safety of the vehicle. On the other hand, technicians are human, and you/service writer/manager should use it as a teaching lesson to the technician to ensure he NEVER does this again.

Give them the opportunity to make it right. This may improve shop training/operation and improve your relationship with the shop. If the shop doesn't want to own up to it, or is rude, that would be an invitation to not give them your business anymore.

After he worked on it, I was still having issues with leaks and when he took another look at it a week later, he said it would be too big of a job for him to do, so he recommended a shop to take it to. 

While it was in the shop, the mechanic offered to replace the spark plugs because he would have easy access to them. I said not to, since it was just completed a month ago. He insisted that they should be replaced. 

When I picked up the car, he gave me the old spark plugs and said they were very old. I reached out to the first guy and he is adamant that he replaced them. 

So, my question is: is there any chance that these were replaced recently? Could the engine leak cause them to look this way?

1nh3wod,Did my dealership’s oil overfill cause engine damage? Need mechanic input,"Hi everyone,  
I really need a professional opinion here because I feel stuck between what my dealership is saying and what an independent mechanic found.

Here’s the timeline:

* **Tuesday**: Took my 2018 Hyundai Tucson (1.6L turbo) to the official Hyundai dealership for a regular service + oil change.
* **Friday**: While driving for a road trip on a steep hill, the car suddenly couldn't accelerate, engine light came on, and it had to be towed.
* **Independent mechanic closeby**:
   * Measured extra **2.5 liters oil** from what the max is. 
   * Showed us the dipstick reading, confirmed overfill.
   * Found a **spark plug with a broken tip** (he showed us the broken piece, said it might have entered the cylinder and damaged it).
   * Warned that the engine might be seriously damaged.
   * They replaced the spark plugs for testing but the car still had **misfire and cylinder compression issues**.
* **Back at Hyundai dealership**:
   * After we towed the car to the official dealership  
   * They say oil overfill “cannot cause this kind of damage.”
   * They confirmed one spark plug tip broke off and caused internal engine damage.
   * Their current assessment is that the **short block is damaged** and needs replacement.
   * They offered partial “goodwill” coverage (short block + most labour), but they want me to accept liability for other potential future damage (valves, turbo, catalytic converter) if it shows up. As they can't find the piece of the sparks that broke and they don't know if anything else could be damaged. 
   * They haven’t given any explanation *why* the spark plug tip failed in the first place. Just that the cause of the engine damage is the spark plug piece that broke. 
   * Attaching a picture of the broken sparks plug that looks it's soaked in oil. 

My questions for the mechanics here:

1. **Could an oil overfill of \~2.5L cause spark plug failure or tip breakage?**
2. If not, what are the common causes of spark plug tips breaking off like this, especially only days after service?
3. From your experience, does this sound more like a result of improper service, or could it realistically just be a freak coincidence?
4. How would you recommend I handle this with Hyundai, given the independent mechanic’s documented findings?

We’re now stuck with huge stress (hotel, towing, rental car, trip expenses, etc.), plus the dealership wants me to sign off on possible future costs. I just want to understand mechanically what’s most likely here so I can push back with facts.

Would really appreciate any experienced insight.

No.

If not, what are the common causes of spark plug tips breaking off like this, especially only days after service?)))

The oil change has nothing to do with the plug breakage. None. Plugs can break from improper gapping and detonation

From your experience, does this sound more like a result of improper service,)))

From an oil change? Not a chance in hell.

How would you recommend I handle this with Hyundai,(((

Either take the goodwill and cough up the rest or find another shop that comes up with a better idea. The plug damage wasn't caused by the dealer.

Solomon_knows (Score: 1): Doubtful 1.5L overfill caused that. It could cause damage. Extremely Overfilled oil typically will break the bottom of the piston skirt first because the piston hits the oil. A piston with a hole in it top of it caused by spark plug debris (or something else like valve, valve seat, piston ring, failed and broke the spark plug) could cause overfilled engine oil (unburned fuel goes into the oil) but I wouldn’t expect it that quickly."
1nh3rbo,Brake pads not wearing flush? Issue?,"Hi everyone, I am after some advice on a recent brake job I had done the end of May/5000miles ago (2013 Ford Focus SE, 2L).

Went to my usual, very highly rated garage, for a replacement of front brake pads and rotors. Was charged $630 - labor $290 and parts $340 (BrakeBest parts(?)).

Forgive my ignorance, used to be pretty handy on my Kawasaki and have replaced pads/discs before - but nothing on a car. Today I was topping up pressures noticed the pads have started to wear at an angle. The bottom part of the uneven pad also seems to be contacting the disc, but not sure if it’s doing that with any real force or just because I braked to a stop and then parked.

I’m not going crazy right - something is wrong with the way the pads are wearing? Strange as it’s on both sides and not just like one caliper has seized or something.

Pending advice/comments here I’ll get in contact with my garage and try to take it in around work this week. Unfortunately as I’ve only just noticed this now (4 months and 5k miles later) I’m expecting it’s mine to pay for(?).

Thanks!

1nh079x,2008 Toyota Sienna 2GR-FE temperature gauge fluctuating,Hello today my wife and I were driving down the highway and the A/C went warm. I looked at the temp gauge and it was a little higher than normal. After looking at it for a few seconds it visibly went down then back up. As the minutes went by it kept fluctuating. It would stay warmer at idle but still go back down. Driving would make the temp go back down quickly but it would go back up. My only working theory is that this past Monday my wife took me to the airport and it was the first chilly morning of the year so we turned the heater on. After about 3 minutes of cold air the heat came on in full force. I think maybe the last time a mechanic changed the coolant they didn't let it flow into the heater core and turning the heater on Monday made the coolant level go lower. Does this sound correct?

On most, if not all, modern cars the hot coolant flows through the heater core all the time.  Whether you get heat or not is controlled by blend doors (dampers).  If you have rear heat in the van, there could be a second heater core farther back in the van, and a bunch of pipes that carry coolant back there.

Her battery is several years old and had some issues a few years ago. I decided to just outright replace it. Well when we started up the car the engine and electrical components worked again but the engine immediately shut off and we got an error: Button for driver assistance system defective. I couldn’t find much online about it. I think it’s some kind of anti theft mechanism. We got the same error a few years ago when we disconnected the battery. I can’t remember exactly but I think it was to clear some CEL codes. My buddy who is much more proficient with cars did some DIY thing where he disconnected the instrument cluster and that seemed to be a workaround at the time. I tried doing it myself and it didn’t work. I ended up losing a screw trying to put the cluster back on and got very frustrated.

Anyways I decided to just take it to the VW dealership. I read that sometimes the ECU would need to be reprogrammed with specialized equipment after a battery disconnect. I thought I’d have to spend a few more hundred bucks, but the service rep called and said the gateway module went bad and needed to be replaced. $1548 for parts and labor (part is $598). He couldn’t determine what happened to it, just that it can’t communicate properly. We can’t afford not to have it fixed. We decided to approve the repair on Friday and the rep said the part wouldn’t get here until Monday since it’s a state over. We called at 10:30 am to approve the repair and we got a text at 4:50 pm the same day that her car is all fixed. I called back and questioned how it was fixed so fast when we were expecting Monday. He said that the part got delivered ahead of schedule. We also got a text later saying the rep gave us a $100 discount as a good faith gesture.

The temperature gauge will climb fairly quickly, usually when idling, but not always, and peg out. When it overheats while idling, when I speed up, it goes back to normal also quickly. It’ll do it a few times, but not all the time, for a few weeks and then it’ll be months before it does it again.

I had the radiator replaced a couple years ago and I had the coolant, belt, and fans checked last week and they all work. But it’s hard to diagnose when it doesn’t overheat, as everything runs properly. My mechanic said it isn’t the thermostat sticking or there would be steam and if it were the water pump, it wouldn’t be intermittent. The fans run, but the only way to know it’s the fans is to check when the car is overheating, right? Plus, they have to run when the AC is on.

Other than a bad sensor where it’s not actually overheating at all, what could the problem be? The high temp light has never come on (does it even have one?

The longer answer is that once the rubber boot rips open, it allows water & dirt intrusion, which quickly wears out the balljoint because it's like constantly grinding greasy sandpaper in there.


So basically, both shops are technically right, & you have a little time to save for balljoint replacement if you need to.

Were the wheels steered to the right when you noticed this? If so that is by design. Camber changes as the wheels turn because of the castor angle.

1ngyg70,I bought a car that needs more help than I do,"So my husband and I got a 2006 ford focus today. I have named her Danger. We are and have been well aware that she's a project for sure. Tho considering it cost 500$ that a family friend is letting us pay in installments, we have no problems with it. But !! Fellow car people, I need some advice. Here's a little info about what Danger's got going on.

The Good:
- It's a second car
- Brakes have been replaced already
- Engine starts and it drives (horribly, but it drives)
- Spark plugs have already been replaced prior

The Bad:
- Windshield has a crack, rearview mirror is in shambles, and the passenger side mirror is on a missing person's list
- Left rear brake light/turn signal is completely out
- Needs new tires, they're 2023 but they're already cracking from age
- Steering wheel lock does not work, it has a rough time turning especially at lower speeds, but also bounces like it's in a trampoline park.
- Power steering fluid is leaking
- There's oil leaking from somewhere, it somehow made its way onto the top of the engine
- Battery thinks it's in a mosh pit, there's no brackets holding it down
- Engine mounts are definitely bad, it vibrates the entire car like a broken washing machine
- Gas tank has a hat but there's no body hat for the gas cap
- Stereo is wild and free, it has no housing

The Ugly:
- There's probably more wrong with it but we have yet to fully diagnose our dear Danger. We have to get her up in the air to check everything else.

So i'm wondering
1. what websites would be best for buying proper parts that fit the vehicle? Some OEM parts from Ford have been discontinued
2. Is there any resources I can utilize to get into the schematics for the electrical system?
3. Any diagnostic advice for testing the rest of her components is very welcome

Secondly… if you are having to pay your friend $500 in installments for what sounds like a monumental fix up job… you might want to reassess if this level of a fixer upper is what you want.

A new OEM windshield from Ford runs you $225ish dollars. New tires are going to be a couple hundred, and then you don’t even know what could be wrong with the engine. A new engine could run you $500-1k (or even more) depending on if you do it yourself or not.

If it doesn't look good wet next easiest DIY step would be to pick up some cans of Duplicolor (or NAPA can mix it), ideally remove the bumper (or mask to prevent over spray), sand everything to 400 grit, (ideally prime and sand, but whatever), spray, polish.  The color match won't be exact and finish won't be perfect but good chance only you will notice/care.

I've had this obsession of just being behind the wheel and driving down roads quick, and I've had a few instances where I'd think about taking one of my parent's cars and just driving around, though the furthest I got with this was pulling out half way out of the driveway and then going back.

Now the only reason I did was due to me pulling out too quick, the tires did a loud screech so I thought my parents would've heard. Back on topic, I've been spending a lot of nights wondering if I should take my grandma's car due to it being around from 2022 SUV, though every time I get the car started I get nervous and wonder if it's even a good idea.

The only ways I can get the itch off for a bit, is basically begging my mom to let me practice driving in the mall's empty parking lot, and it's effective, I can go a few days without wanting to do any driving. But these times are rare, and only happen around once a week, to only a few times a month. And my only experience with driving is going around in parking lots, practicing parking, practicing taking fast turns and slow turns, and learning distance, which I think I've gotten okay at so far, but far from perfect.

""The Truth in Mileage Act (TIMA) of 1986 is a federal law in the United States that strengthens consumer protection against odometer fraud by requiring accurate disclosure of a vehicle's mileage during the transfer of ownership. The act mandates that the person transferring a vehicle must provide a written statement of the odometer reading and its accuracy to the buyer, increasing penalties for odometer violations from $1,000 to $2,000 for civil penalties and up to three years imprisonment for criminal offenses. The law also includes specific requirements for disclosures related to leased vehicles and specifies exemptions for certain vehicles, such as older models.  
Key Provisions
Odometer Disclosure:
The transferor (seller) of a non-exempt vehicle must provide a written statement of the current odometer reading and disclose whether it reflects the actual mileage. 
Lessee Disclosure:
For leased vehicles, the lessee is required to provide mileage information to the lessor when the lessor transfers ownership. 
Penalties for Violations:
The act increased the civil penalty for odometer fraud violations to $2,000 and raised the maximum criminal penalty to three years in prison. 
Exemptions:
Certain vehicles are exempt from the disclosure requirements, including vehicles 10 model years or older (with specific rules on how this exemption evolves annually) and commercial vehicles above a certain gross vehicle weight. 
Record Keeping:
Auction companies must establish and maintain records of vehicles sold, including the names of the owner and buyer, the vehicle's VIN, and the odometer reading at the time of auction. 
Purpose
The Truth in Mileage Act aims to protect consumers from odometer fraud, a practice that involves tampering with a vehicle's odometer to indicate a lower mileage than the vehicle has actually traveled, thus falsely increasing its value. 
How It Works
When a vehicle is sold, the seller must complete an odometer disclosure statement that is signed and printed by both the transferor and the transferee (buyer). This statement becomes part of the official title transfer process, giving buyers crucial information about the vehicle's mileage.

1. With my new live data, what does the issue of this P2002 code most likely be?
2. What steps should I take exactly to try troubleshoot this code and fix it completely?
3. If P2002 is usually for DPF issues and clogged DPF etc., then why is all my live data fine with the DPF? How can I make sure the DPF is fine without removing it, as I am worried the mechanics here would do more harm than good when trying to remove it? I’m not sure how accessible or easy it is to remove, and are you guys confident it is not the DPF when looking at my live data on OBD and your general knowledge?

1ngifp0,"Repairs, replace, or trash engine?","I have a 19 year old Toyota Corolla with a 1.8L engine, 260,000 miles on it, that I’m trying to decide if I should trash the motor or replace it. Timing chain broke recently, bolt head holding the sprocket on is missing, sprocket teeth shaved down and plenty of small metal shavings found in the areas shown in the pic. Pretty sure there’s a high chance valves are bent, and possibly pistons damaged, but not sure. Would need to do a compression/leak-down test.

I have a few different ideas for keeping the car and wondering what others’ opinions are for this motor. If you were to keep the car, what route would you take?

The options I have come up with so far…

1. Pull motor and swap with a lower mileage one. eBay shows them any where from $1000 to $2000 delivered. So that kind of gives me a baseline for what an engine swap might look like.

2. Pull motor and clean shavings out as best as possible, replace pump, install new chain, and add a rebuilt head. Seems rebuilt heads might not cost too much, at least compared to a newer motor. But will ALL of the shavings be cleaned out? We turned the motor over quite a bit in this state trying to determine why it won’t start when cranking. Afraid shaving may be lodged in some pretty tight corners, just waiting to wreak havoc.

3. Pull motor and rebuild lower end and replace head. A lot of downtime and machine work. And maybe very costly as well. Trying to keep downtime a minimum… right.. lol

4. Order short block or rebuilt motor. Looks expensive.

I know some you will say throw out the car and just get a newer one, which isn’t off the table, but my son loves the car and if I can save us some money with repairs I will. If I could get another 50k miles out of the car I’d be really happy with it. 

Now I’ve rebuilt some motors in the past, and I’ve replaced several engines and transmissions over the years, so pulling a motor isn’t that big of deal for me. I’ve done a lot of repairs myself so I’d like to try to keep this out of the shop if can. Just looking for some opinions on this, maybe an idea or two I haven’t thought of or something.

Originally I thought it was transmission oil leaking out from the pan seal. However after looking up under it, it appears it is a leak originating from the top of the transmission. It appears to be coming from a line on the top side of the transmission that is attached to the back side of the engine block. The fluid appears to have a reddish tint so I thought it was transmission fluid, however now I am wondering if it is radiator fluid. I traced the lines from the back of the engine block and they wrap around to the passenger side of the block and then turn to rubber hoses and go into the firewall.

1ngz0na,How to get my 2005 Nissan Altima with 70k miles to start again?,"I am determined to fix my car with very little money. It’s an ugly thing, but it just needs a little love! 

No clicking noise when I turn the key, literally nothing happens. new battery (7/24) that was never used, can jump start but dies after 10 minutes again. Now it’s been sitting in the garage for a year. Is it possible?

Okay, I admit I am a 33F that knows nothing about cars. So, what do I do? Head to Reddit (solving all of my problems since 2012), of course! I do not know anyone that could help me financially, and can’t afford to get it towed to a mechanic or even afford a mechanic. 

Last time I attempted to drive it (June 2024) I got it out of the parking garage at my apartment complex, drove 15 minutes, then it died. I replaced the battery thinking it was a dead battery. Had someone jump the car, and it started and I was able to drive it back to the parking garage. It died right as I was sliding it into a parking spot. 

It hasn’t turned on since. After a year of many uninteresting excuses, I am now getting around to trying to fix it because I need a car. Can’t afford to buy one, can’t afford the time it takes to save for one, and so I am determined to make this car work! Maybe I’m delusional, but here we are. 

I’ve added some pictures of what it could be. Here are my zero-experience theories after researching what I could online:

1) Old cable coming from battery to engine that need to be replaced 

2) Some kind of missing fluid

3) needs a new starter

4) the whole shit is fucked, sell it for parts

TheTense (Score: 3): Unbolt the battery terminal connection by loosening the screw on the side. Wiggle it around until it slides off the top.

Get a circular wire brush and stuff it in that loop and sand off the corrosion. An auto parts store will sell one, but a gun barrel cleaning brass brush will work too. Worse case wrap some sandpaper around your pinky and twist it around in there until it’s shines like bare metal.

Do the same thing on the corroded battery post, this is made of lead, so it’ll clean off a lot more easily. Don’t breathe the dust and wash your hands afterwards thoroughly.

Reattach to the car battery and tighten the side nut slightly firmly so it makes a tight squeeze on the battery post. You can try to charge the battery overnight and then start the car. If it tries to crank, great. The battery and corrosion were the first problem. But why it died in the first place needs to be addressed.

I’m willing to guess the alternator is dead and it wasnt charging the battery. So it drained the battery in 15 minutes of driving… your 2024 new battery has been sitting dead for a year, so now it’s likely failed and needs to be replaced again.

Replace the alternator AND the battery and it’ll likely work fine.

Also, get an oil change. It’s been sitting too long. If it’s low definitely add a quart until it’s in between the lines on the dipstick.

Finally you fuel is a year old now. Gas doesn’t keep well. Any more than a year and it may not run well. Consider trying to run the tank low then filling up with fresh gas as soon as you can."

The closest i've found so far is ""right bumper cable chassis"" but the connections aren't quite right for any that I've been able to find (haven't found my exact model but trying to find something similar that will still work).

  
I'm wondering if maybe i've stumbled onto the wrong name and have confused myself. If anyone would be able to assist in other search terms I could look that might be more accurate I'd greatly appreciate it.

**Car:** Toyota RAV4 2010 2.2 D-CAT Diesel, 74,000 miles

After an hour of driving I got:

**P2002 – DPF efficiency below threshold (Bank 1)**

Cleared it and the lights went away, but I think it’ll return on a highway run.

* DPF overtemperature: **Normal**
* DPF no activate: **activate**
* DPF thermal deteriorate: **Normal**
* AF Lambda B1S1: 0.0 → should be \~1.0 at idle apparently
* AF sensor learning value: 1.4 V → should be \~3.0–3.3 V at idle apparently
* AFS current B1S1: −128 mA → should be −2 to +2 mA apparently
* Differential pressure sensor corr: −0.93 kPa → should be 0.0 ±0.2 kPa with ignition ON apparently; does not change with revs or engine on

---

**Questions:**

1. With my new live data, what does the issue of this P2002 code most likely be?
2. What steps should I take exactly to try troubleshoot this code and fix it completely?
3. If P2002 is usually for DPF issues and clogged DPF etc., then why is all my live data fine with the DPF? How can I make sure the DPF is fine without removing it, as I am worried the mechanics here would do more harm than good when trying to remove it? I’m not sure how accessible or easy it is to remove, and are you guys confident it is not the DPF when looking at my live data on OBD and your general knowledge?
4. What parts of my car should I check in the engine area, under the car, pipes, etc.? Tell me specific names for each part please.

I’m in Africa with no skilled mechanics, so I need **clear steps** before this turns into another 6-month headache again.

This slip confirms it though, they used proper tester for it but this slip is fucking useless without the values measured (and no, PASS/FAIL are not values)

That said, get the car inspected properly for the electric iffies. Like said your vehicle has an electronically controlled charging circuit and basically every one of these rapid testers will say faulty alternator if there's no load on it.

And that said, you'll probably still have a loose battery terminal after the dipshit tested the battery. Check that the battery terminals are tight and clean before doing anything else."

Edit: For those asking for more details-  intake gasket on my v6 was leaking coolant (not the head gasket as someone suggested) at first I would loose a quart or so every few days. then a quart a day. eventually it got so bad that I couldnt keep up with it and it overheated, so in a desperate attempt to get home, I used basically every liquid I had at my disposal until I could find a gas station to get actual water jugs. Eventually the radiator gave as well and I had to replace that along with my intake gaskets. 

I had another situation where my heater core sprung a leak on a road trip and I had to use a cooler full of drinks along with the melted ice to make it through the night and kept pouring water in it every day until I got home.

My issue is that when I removed the compressor dump any oil in there I found that there was none, it is not dry by any means I just mean there was nothing to pour out but it is oily inside, also it is shiny inside, does not seem burned.  

Questions:

1.  Should I continue taking apart the apart the ac system and flush it out or should I just add what amount of oil should be in there and hope for the best?  
2.  If I am to flush it out am I correct in guessing I would flush it from low to high after disconnecting the hoses from the condenser and drier, also can I flush through the expansion valve or do I need to remove that as well?
3. Is there a chance that all the oil settled into the drier?

Other information: I used a circuit test to make sure the clutch does in fact engage and it does so that seems fine.  When I took hooked up some gauges to it to see if it had any refrigerant in it I discovered it had nothing in it, I dont know if that means the previous owner had it pulled or if there was a leak I am kind just assuming leak would be the safe route.

Are you having a loss of engine coolant? ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE A COMPLETELY SEALED SYSTEM PRIOR TO THIS DETERMINATION.

Is the ignition system working properly? 

  -- Excessive fuel injection by means of a really botched tune or faulty injector(s) can lead to unburnt gasoline exiting the exhaust with a white color. (This is different from black smoke due to a rich AFR). A cylinder with no ignition may still have fuel injected, leading to this condition (unlikely due to BMWs ECU program conditions). Also, look for any signs of a rich AFR at any engine speed (especially under load - have someone drive behind you and watch).

  -- Certain synthetic oils burn with a light gray/gray color, which is sometimes hard to distinguish from coolant (white smoke) in the light. Are you burning excessive amounts of oil? What led you to replace the valve cover as a whole (no mention of gasket only) and the PCV?
EDIT:
  -- Is your turbocharger okay? Look for signs of excessive oil in the intercooler hoses/pipes and your throttle body.

  -- Conduct a cooling system pressure test to verify that there are no external leaks. Watch for the pressure to bleed and coolant loss/drip from any hoses, line connections, and especially the coolant supply & return lines to your turbocharger(s) if present. If the pressure remains constant and you have verified no external leaks, I would look into having the head gaskets tested.

  -- Test your head gasket seal(s):

     Go to O'Reilly Auto Parts or similar and get a combustion leak tester; like their rental 67094 and it's accompanying fluid 67098.

     Follow a video like this if you've never done something like this before: https://m.youtube.com/shorts/R8gjc9fdW_k


This video also mentions another option which is a combustion leakdown test, however that is more involved and complex. I would only do this if you want to be super sure about things and didn't get a conclusive result from the chemical combustion leak tester.


There's still more you could do, but unless you own a nice bidirectional scan-tool to read all of your car's computers, data retrieval for diagnostic may be limited

1nh1czc,Rental van clutch failure — need opinions on wear vs misuse,"I rented a campervan in Albania for a week. On day 4 the clutch failed - with the engine off the gear stick moved fine, but with the engine running it wouldn’t go into gear at all. The van was towed, clutch replaced, and now the rental company says I burnt out a healthy clutch in those 4 days.
I was able to see the old parts:
The clutch disc still had material left but had shiny glazed patches and discoloration.
The pressure plate had polished circular marks and heat spots.
The release bearing looked dry and worn.
Hydraulics weren’t replaced.
Their mechanic argues the rim wear on the disc isn’t “significant enough” for long-term wear and says this points to misuse over my four days of driving. He also claimed all the scorching was caused by me. 

I’d really like technical input on:

Is rim thickness a fair way to judge wear, or do glazing/heat spots tell the real story?

Could a healthy clutch realistically be destroyed in 4 days of mountain driving, or do the parts I described sound like long-term wear?

Is a mechanic’s word enough in these cases, or should inspection/service records be expected?

Not asking people to take my side - just want an honest mechanical perspective on how this should be assessed.

1nh07gm,"Sudden engine failure, need advice","**Camper Engine Problem in Croatia - Need Advice**

I'm currently on vacation in Croatia with my camper when I encountered a serious engine problem. While driving on the highway, my camper started vibrating when the RPMs were high. When I pressed the clutch, it sounded normal at idle, but the vibration returned whenever I increased the engine RPM.

I slowed down to limp to the next exit, but the engine died while waiting in line at a toll booth. I have a video taken shortly before it died - the problem was getting progressively worse.

Car:  
European ford transit 2018 converted to a camper, 2.0L diesel with 170hp, manual transmission.

**Background:**

* The engine was replaced only 1.5 years ago
* It has only done 10,000 km since replacement
* No warning lights are showing
* The engine turns over 1 to 2 turns, the road service tried it.
* **Important note:** When the timing belt failed last time, it triggered error codes on the dashboard - but this time there are no error messages at all

**My Current Situation:** I don't have roadside assistance coverage (I thought it was included with my car insurance, but it's not). I'm considering three options:

1. **Local diagnostic:** Get it towed for proper diagnosis somewhere in Croatia
2. **Transport home:** Ship it back to Germany where I live (estimated cost: €2,000)
3. **Other options?** I'm open to suggestions

**My Main Questions:**

* Is the engine completely ruined again?
* What would you recommend as the best course of action?

The absence of dashboard error codes makes me wonder if it can be saved locally, sadly the location where I broke down there's only a small town mechanic which said the engine would need to be taken apart, but he did not do a compression test or so only tried turning it over a couple of times..  
there was some language barrier so not totally sure what he said, but he would not be able to do so.

  
EDIT:

forgot to mentioned that I then went to check the oil and noticed that the dipstick was broken off, the bottom of it(plastic)

Im re building a 5.6L diesel izuzu generator.  Its had a new crankshaft installed,  clearances are good, deflection is minimal 0.001. However,  I had issues with installing the idle gear thats timed off the crankshaft gear (new gear already on the crank) i have no backlash on the gear when its installed and its binding up and rough when turned.  The idle gear also has no end play and looks skeew on the new idle shaft.  

There is no clearance between the gears it looks like.  The only grey area is the crank and gear came together and I imagine is Chinese junk ... no spec sheet, was supplied by the office.

This line tells me all I need to know. The owner's manual and maintenance recommendations are written by the marketing department, not by engineers. The car company wants to be able to advertise low maintenance and low cost of ownership to the consumer to make their product attractive. That usually runs counter to what's best for the car, but their only goal is just for it to last through the warranty period before problems appear.

2. Should I just replace them both, anyway? I'm not rich so I'd be going w MagnaFlow and hoping for the best. I'd do a universal cat for the rear, so there's welding involved unless labor costs put that in the same range as purchasing and installing a direct fit in the rear.

DotCottonsHandbag (Score: 1): I’m not a car person at all really, but I spent nine years as a Fiesta-owner. What I will say is that my 2011 Fiesta’s clutch finally died about a month ago, at ~83k miles. It would have been about £800-900ish to repair, and the car was only worth about £500 at that point so I decided to offload it. That’s something to factor in, since their clutches have generally got about 80k miles in them depending on driving habits (I was not terribly kind to my little Fiesta) and the one you’re looking at isn’t far off that. 

Brake discs and pads would be a relatively cheap fix to do yourself, my boyfriend did mine for me on the driveway last summer and the front discs and pads came to just under £100 from the local Eurocarparts. I’d be reasonably confident having a go myself now I’ve seen how it’s done (although for a car I didn’t already own, I’d be getting the seller to do it, not me). But I’d be surprised if that fixed the squeaks, since mine did begin squeaking a few months ago even with new parts. Never figured out what it might have been.

And the A/C thing is possibly a damaged pipe if mine is anything to go by. Don’t let them fob you off with a refresh of the refrigerant, get them to investigate it properly. 

They’re cheap little runners, I loved mine, but do be mindful that this one is likely to start needing some love at this age - check to see what’s already been repaired in its lifetime.

1nh2lsk,Bad experience with C Class recall from Mercedes,"My engine warning light on my Mercedes C Class has been showing on and off for the past couple months so I paid £40 to a local independent garage for an engine diagnostics which found faults with the Nox sensors.  They advised to take it to Mercedes because my car was part of a recall for the exact same reason. 

I booked my “free” service with Mercedes who reiterated that the recall was for fixing issues with Nox sensors and software updates, and I handed my car to their official local garage. Since my engine warning light came on intermittently, it wasn’t on when I gave my car to them so I couldn’t point it out.

The next day when my car was being worked on, I got a call from them saying my car was empty on ad blue and wouldn’t turn on, saying I need to pay £25 for them to top it up and proceed with the service. I found this very suspicious since my car would give warnings for low ad blue several 100 miles in advance, but I saw nothing of the sort before this, but agreed anyways giving them the benefit of the doubt. After the phone call I looked up the typical price of an ad blue top up and found it’s normally tenner, so I called them up again saying this and they lowered the price to £14.

I picked up my car later that day and they told me they saw no issues with my Nox sensors and thus did no work on the car other than a software update. I challenged them on this saying I got an engine check done on it because the light keeps coming on and off, but they said this could be due to the old software false flagging issues and gave this same reason for how my low ad blue warning wasn’t showing before, so I again gave them the benefit of the doubt and left after paying my £14 for the ad blue.

Fast forward a whole two weeks and <100 miles travelled later, my engine warning light has now come on again and as well as this, a low ad blue warning saying my engine won’t start in 450 miles unless I top it up. So now I’m feeling conned because Mercedes are saying there’s no fault with the Nox sensors when the diagnostics clearly say there is, and also feeling like they upsold me for the ad blue when they didn’t even fill it up and most likely lied saying it was low in the first place (especially considering I got no warnings for it in the last 2 years).

The diagnostics that the independent did for £25 was just to read the code off the OBD port its entirely possible the software was at fault and giving false errors which is what merc are claiming. They may be wrong but they know they are just going to have the car back under the recall if they are wrong so not much benefit to them in doing it.

So could there be a software fault and they're right, or there could be a fault with the NOX sensor which isn't being picked up by the Xentry system it's hard to tell when the engine light comes on intermittently.

A few months ago I impulsively bought a 2010 Mk6 Golf GT TSI (CAVD engine) with the following modifications:

Gutted cat, res delete, GTI backbox, stage 1 remap, mst hard pipe and intake (I don't know who did the mods).

Problem:

MOT is due in 2 weeks and I'm assuming it wil fail due to the gutted cat. A garage quoted me £3k+ to put it right but basically told me to sell it as they can't guarantee a fix without knowing whats been done with the ECU remap/other modifications.

They said my car has a cat manifold, so the cat is built into the exhaust manifold? I was under the impression if I replace the cat and flash ECU back to stock, it should at least pass emissions?

Questions:

* If the cat’s gutted, does that mean I need to replace the full manifold + cat?
* Could I weld a sports cat further down the exhaust?
* Can the ECU be flashed back to stock easily, or is it trickier since it’s been mapped to ignore the gutted cat?
* Do the other mods (res delete, intake, backbox, etc.) affect anything here?
* Realistically, am I better off cutting my losses and selling as a project car?

Going to speak with some mates who know mechanics to see if they can take a look.

I get that there could be other issues and it’s hard to diagnose on a Reddit post 😂 but I’d appreciate any advice. I know I’ve left it late with MOT coming up, but I got carried away driving it 😅.

I would check the MOT history to see where it was last passed and take it there, personally.

Many of the mods are more of an issue between you and your insurance company. The cheapest check for if it's deeemd roadworthy is to sling it in for an MOT where they'll do emissions, just make sure they're done hot and give her a good run before going in. 

If you want some of the mods removed I'd probably just sell it after the MOT and only put on mods you want."

Make sure your tyres are properly inflated and in good condition, likewise check your bulbs are all working, wipers are in decent shape, and fill up your screenwash with it mixed to the 'winter' concentration as per the instructions on the bottle.


Keep a warm jacket, gloves, de-icer spray, and a plastic window scraper in the car. 


If your car has AC, run it with the air recirculating and heat turned up to demist windows fastest. 


To defrost windows, run the car with the heat turned up, and use de-icer and the scraper. There are a whole bunch of other methods too. Simply draping an old cloth or towel over the windows on frosty nights does wonders for keeping the frost off. 


Scraping windows off is a pain but go all the way round and get them all, don't be one of these berks driving around squinting out a foot-square hole scraped in the windscreen with all the other windows iced over. It's dangerous and the cops will pull you over. 


Try and take your car to a car wash which offers an underbody wash every few weeks at least while the roads are salty, or get a sprayer for under the car if you wash it at home. It will save you time and pain in the long run by reducing rusting.

I also tend to keep a cloth in the car so i wipe the window.

you may also find if it get cold enough, the car locks will freeze up and the car will not unlock, warm/hot water over the lock/keyhole will help melt all that way.

some people may use a car cover or a windscreen cover to prevent snow on the windscreen, i have also seen people just use bubble wrap.

1ngqfy4,Coming out of a company car - what to get.,"Hi,

So for as long as I can remember I’ve had a company car. Currently I have a hybrid SUV that will be going back due to taking another job without a vehicle. I am really struggling at the moment even trying to narrow it down. 

Prior to company cars I have had fiesta ST, megane RS, bmw z4m all of which didn’t need to be practical and were also used for track days. 

Fast forward I now have a 4yo girl so need to be a bit more practical, while I still want it to be ‘fun’. 

My issue is partly money, I don’t want to finance anything so max budget is 10k, ideally I’d want to spend around 5k. And while it doesn’t sound a lot, I am waiting for a large inheritance being processed so whatever I get doesn’t necessarily need to be long term. 

I’ve looked at everything, Audi a3/4/5/6, various BMWs, golf gti’s and the like. Because it is my decision and I am spending my own money I really dont know where to start, it’s been a good nearly 10yrs since I owned a car. 

I’m not necessarily bothered about comfort, my megane had a cage, recaro pole positions, coilovers etc and I used to drive 80 mile a day to work. It needs to be able to fit 2 adults and a 4yo. 

I need some help with some suggestions as currently I am undecided.

After reading every reply, we have a few updates.

So the reason we were looking at the qashqai is simply that we haven't got the money to be able to get the work done all at the same time. Unfortunately we've had family drama and had to make quite a few 600 mile round trips which have crippled us. Secondly, the car just seems to keep throwing problems at me and it got frustrating so I just thought, get a newer car and all will be good.

With all that said, we are going to fix the X5 starting this week with some secondhand wheels on the front that have got new tyres.

Thank you all for clearing my mind.

===============================================

Me and the wife went to look for a newer car yesterday to replace our 2009 BMW X5. We ended up doing a deal on a 2020 Nissan Qashqai but it had a gearbox problem and kept stalling on the way home so we returned it. After chatting on the way home, we realised that all the cars we looked at just don't hold a candle to the premium feel of the X5.

So my question is this - in the 2017-2023 age range but sub £15k, is there any car that has a premium feel or are they all just oceans of plastic and despair?

I don’t know anything about cars and don’t have anyone who does, so I’d rather buy from a dealer to at least have a warranty/backup if things go wrong. Problem is, I’ll see cars I like on AutoTrader, then check the dealer’s Google reviews and they look awful, wouldn't risk giving them my money.

There are some other models I'm considering but  budget would be the same regardless - I understand this does put approved-used options out of the question.

Are there any dealers in the UK you’d actually trust (nationwide or regional)? And what kind of red flags should I look out for when checking dealers/reviews/listings? Any tips on questions to ask or checks to do before signing anything would be really useful too.

My advice would be to go private with the age of the vehicles you're looking at, but I get wanting the warranty and security net. However, anything that does go wrong would likely have been fixable for less than buying from a dealer over private would cost. That said, you need a bit of knowledge buying privately to spot issues before you buy. You don't really need that when buying from a dealer, depending on if you're able to actually know an issue when it arises and get it logged / fixed before the 6 month warranty expires.

After looking up the council pool vehicles they don’t have their own but source rental cars through enterprise so that would make sense. 
If this was a rental car they legally have to disclose this to the new buyer!? 

I am hoping to see V5 tomorrow for previous owner history but they didn’t willingly share it before buying.

It was bought 2 days ago, so well within the 30 days and phoned the next day about some issues including noise in undercarriage and stains on seats that wasn’t previously disclosed/ was hidden.

Can I reject it for a full refund or what are my rights?

UPDATE: I went back to the dealer and they were decent about it and apologetic. Thankfully they have lived up to their reputation! 
He confirmed that it was a privately owned company Enterprise in the past and everything I suspected is true. 
He agreed it was in an awful condition internally under the seats and hasn’t been valeted or checked properly before picking up. 
They have agreed to take the car back in. Clean it to the standard it should have been in and check the mechanics for the rattling noise and fix some other details missed. I’ll then get to make a better decision afterwards on whether to keep or replace with a new car.",0,1757834820.0,68,CartalkUK,1757964775,2025-09-14 07:27:00,2025-09-15 19:32:55,"JobWelt (Score: 24): Can you reject it because you don’t like who it was owned by previously?

They don't have to tell you who previously owned it, or make assumptions on your behalf about how it was used by previous owners.

Aviator760 (Score: 5): Yes. My job is in bodywork and I'm trained in carrying out chip repairs. This very much looks like a DIY job and they haven't bladed off the excess resin. I reckon the dealer bought themselves an amazon chip repair kit and thought they'd save themselves a few quid.

Bear in mind that getting insurance for the windscreen and claiming on it after the fact would be insurance fraud. Many people do it but if you've just taken ownership of the car and are claiming for a new windscreen straight away it would set alarm bells ringing at the insurance company. Also as it has previously had a repair they might say they won't cover it as it could have been repairable properly, but now it can't be re-repaired.

Either work something out with the dealer or live with it. Personally it's not in the driver's eyeline so I'd live with it.

EDIT - You can remove the excess resin and make it look a lot better. Get a razor blade, and scrape it over the chip at a 45 degree angle, scrape vigorously, the excess will come off and it'll look much better. Don't worry about scratching the glass, you can't, glass is harder than steel."

1- Do penalty points affect your ability to get a Motability car?

2- What about past or current disqualification?

I managed to do it for £1.500 because of the scratches on the door, I have bough an hpi check to make sure and everything comes okay, same in the MOT, nothing bad comes up just the regular.

I was trying to also do a pre inspection purchase but it's very last minute and there is none available for tomorrow. A friend of mine is going to come with me (she knows a tiny bit more about cars than me that I have no idea) and another one is going to help me by FaceTime because he is out of the country at the moment (my luck) hahah but he knows about cars.

Would this be a silly purchase? Just want a car to learn with and take me from A to B.

1ngdji5,Is it even possible to sell a car with cat S?,"Hi everyone! Maybe some can gave me some advice how to sell a car with a cat S? 
Short story of that car: We've bought it with a friend kinda accidentally from a Copart. We where looking for other cars for ourselves (which we've fixed and keep for ourselves) and we did not really expect to won that Suzuki but, as often, plans and reality doesn't meet eachother so we won it and decided to buy it as it's really a nearly new car. There was no mechanical damage so the only thing that we have to do is to replace a bonnet, one wing, bumper, headlight, grill, and a radiator. I've bought new original body panels and send all that parts to a painter who flashed them and then I've installed everything. I did everything to follow factory quality cause I wanted to make it as new. 
So right now it's in a absolutely amazing condition and we thought that it should be easy to sell. Unfortunately it has a 0 interest from buyers. I already advertised it at least 6k below the market price but still nobody wants it :(
I can't understand what am I doing wrong? Is it still to expensive or what? IMHO getting a nearly new car for that price is a bargain, but looks like others doesn't think so. Maybe I did something wrong in my advertising?
Maybe someone can suggest what to do in my case? Or maybe there is some better ways to advertise such a car? Or maybe some of you has an experience selling a cat S cars and can give me some advice?
I really can't understand what I'm doing wrong :(
