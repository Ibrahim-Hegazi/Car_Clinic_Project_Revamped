1mcrdp8,"Locked in pickup without key fob, how do I get out?","I recently got locked INSIDE the cab of my pickup without the key fob. The fob fell out of my purse (I normally don’t keep it in the outside pocket but had taken it out to close my windows due to rain). Anyway, the fob fell out of my purse as I got into the cab of the pickup. Obviously I didn’t notice until I went to push the button and the dashboard told me I didn’t have the fob. Before I could open the door, the doors locked and I couldn’t even open them from the inside because I didn’t have the fob. My parents brought the spare fob and got the pickup unlocked and that’s when I saw the regular fob laying on the ground right under my door. It had been laying there the whole time, but because it wasn’t within 2 feet of the door lock, it wouldn’t work. Hopefully there isn’t a next time, but if there is, what do I do?",1,1753832735.0,9,MechanicAdvice,1753872317,2025-07-29 23:45:35,2025-07-30 10:45:17,"iscoleslaw (Score: 2): Should be a lock/unlock button on the door lol

I live in Arizona so around the end of May I started to use the ac and noticed it wasn’t blowing that cold but was working enough but when it started to get hot in June it wasn’t working the same. So I took it to a spot just to see what they say and guy was saying it was low on freon so I told him don’t bother so I took it to my spot I been going to and they checked it out and said it was the condenser had a leak and a extension rod was sticking. So had them fix it. Got it back next day blowing the same. Took it back they said was low again and said they think it’s the compressor and would replace for free for misdiagnosing the first repair so had that done for it back 2 days later back to hot air. So took it back and they said after diving deep into it they see marks on the evaporator. So I said I’m going back to the place I bought it and have them check it out. So I did that they said yup evaporator needs replaced so had them do that and got it back and guess what same shit the next day now today they said they have no clue what’s up and need to put a ticket in with GM to assist them the rest of the way. Said no leaks they see but it’s escaping somewhere. So I’ve taken it in 3 separate times and 4k in and still blowing hot with no way of knowing if it will be fixed.

1mcpwgb,Dealership replaced Turbo (P0299) Now telling me to pay $3200 for Catalytic Converter.,"I have a 2016 Hyundai Tucson Limited 1.6L with 130,500 miles. I received check engine code P0299 for turbo underboost and took it Hyundai in May, they said replace the turbo. I then took it to a local reputable mechanic for a second opinion and was told to replace the turbo. At this point I just took it back to Hyundai July 26 (didnt drive the car between May and July - short on finances for the repair..) and they performed a re-diagnosis and said to replace the turbo, so I agreed and financed through Sunbit - Hyundai's financing partner. I have not paid for this repair yet.

I then receive an email about the recommended service for an additional $3200, which states:

**After installation of new turbo charger unit, when test driving the vehicle check engine light turned on and vehicle bogged down and made a noise. When returning to the shop scanned vehicle for codes and found the same P0299 for turbo charger underboost. Check the catalytic converter and found the converter to be blown out from the new turbo charger on the test drive and evidence of shards of the honeycomb that is collapsing internally in the catalytic converter. Will need to replace the catalytic converter unit then re-check vehicle again.**

I am not a mechanic, so I am not sure what to make of this, but I have a gut feeling I am being taken advantage of here. They never mentioned the catalytic converter in any of the previous diagnosis, so what are the chances they install a brand new turbo and then it blows out the catalytic converter?

I believe this is on the dealership for not diagnosing the vehicle properly. I agreed to the turbo replacement, and now this suddenly happens?

July 12 - motor sounds like it wants to eat itself alive. Call a tow to the dealership. Dealership diagnoses a siezed oil control valve causing complete and utter timing chain carnage. Recommends whole timing assembly replacement. Sure thing, let's do it.

July 18 - dealer calls and says the service is complete, and they're ready for me to settle up and drive home. Great! I arrive, the service advisor goes over the invoice with me page-by-page to explain the diag and repair process, SA and invoice both state that the fuel rails and injectors had to be removed to perform the repair. Remember this.

I pay and walk out, and as I'm sitting down in my car for the first time in a week, I notice a *strong* smell of gas inside the cabin. ""The invoice said the fuel rails and injectors had to be removed... Maybe the tech just dribbled some gas on himself and the smell worked its way into the upholstery when he hopped in to roll it out of the service bay. It'll air out in a few days. No matter."" drive home.

I drive into work the next morning, July 19, the smell of gas is still strong in the cabin. It's about a 30 minute drive from home to work; I'm lightheaded by the time I arrive. I'm early - so early that I pull in before any of my coworkers, and as they all come walking past my car, they mention a smell of gasoline on the *outside* of my car as well.

S*it. Call the dealership for advice; things I can look for to confirm or rule out a leak, advise on whether it's safe to drive through my work day (80 miles on a rural mail route), etc. Gentleman says ""I wouldn't drive a vehicle that I think is leaking fuel."" 

Okay, s*it. Call *another* tow. My vehicle arrives back at their shop after working hours that day. They're closed the next day, Sunday. Monday, July 21 comes and nearly goes before I call them about an hour and a half before they close, asking for an update. ""Oh yeah, looks like you're next in line to get diagnosed.""

""Uh, I'm sorry? This vehicle left your bay and arrived back on your lot via flatbed less than 24 hours later after a major service, and nobody thought to prioritize this?""

""I'm sorry, we'll let you know as soon as we know anything""

The next day, Tuesday, I give them a call around lunchtime. They said that the only thing they found was a cracked coolant hose that was dripping directly onto the exhaust manifold, which was what was causing the smell. ""No no, I've smelled what this car smells like when it's burning coolant before; it smells a bit like celery - this was gasoline *for sure*""

""Well the tech took it for several test drives and had it on the lift for several hours and this is the only leak they found, and he didn't notice the smell of gas.""

I'm incredulous, but I concede. ""Okay, I'll take your word for it. I know I've had a small coolant leak for a while now, so I guess, if nothing else, it'll be good to finally get that patched up. I'll call up an Uber so I get settled up for the replacement coolant hose and pick up my vehicle, and I'll call you back to schedule the install of the coolant hose when I know my schedule for next week."" I pick up the vehicle, drive it home.

Arrive at work the next day, July 23. Obviously, the smell persists because nothing has been replaced yet - but I noticed that I was using *considerably* more fuel than usual. I can usually make it through my day, fueling up shortly after leaving home, commuting, driving my route, and driving home, on roughly 3/8ths of a tank. I'm not even all the the way through my route yet, and I've already burned an extra 1/4 tank. It HAS to be leaking... So when I finish up (and get it back from an emergency brake service July 24), I park it in the driveway and slide a piece of cardboard underneath it. I start the engine, put it in neutral, and hold ~3k rpm for a few seconds to build some extra pressure in the fuel system. Foot off the gas, pull the handbrake, put it in park, shut the engine off, pull out the cardboard and I find A Drip on the cardboard! Naturally, I sniff The Drip, and it smells like... gasoline. Wow! The same thing they just told me I *wasn't* leaking! Seems pretty definitive to me.

I'm furious. I use the rest of the day to calm down and have a chat with The Corporation about next steps. I call the dealership to report my findings the next day, July 25. They say ""bring it back as soon as you can on Monday, we'll get to the bottom of it.""

I finish with work yesterday, July 28 and stop at the dealership. I check in with the same service advisor I've been working with this entire time, and he says ""look, the guy who did your timing service doesn't work Mondays, and I don't want too many hands in the cookie jar. Can you come back when he'll be here, tomorrow (today, July 29)?"" ""Sure thing, totally makes sense. I'll be back tomorrow (today, July 29).""

Make it through my work day, hit the car wash as a courtesy, and go straight to the dealership, which I just got home from. The service advisor told me ""you're not going to believe this, but we looked everything over, and it turns out that the coolant was just getting *so hot* as it dripped onto the exhaust manifold that it was smelling like gas. It'll take a few days for the residue to burn off, but we got that coolant hose replaced and you should be good to go.""

So, what say you? They didn't give me any insight as to what sort of diagnostics they did to rule out a fuel leak (nor does today's invoice). Do you buy their story, or are they just trying to cover their asses? I will say that the smell is still there, but not nearly as strong as it has been - just as they forewarned... but it also wasn't getting driven nearly as hard in suburban ""traffic"" on the short drive home as it gets driven on my mail route. I guess we'll see what kind of fun smells the workday brings tomorrow. Fuel economy also seemed to have recovered on my short drive from the gas station back home - hit 26mpg!

**ChatGPT generated TL;DR**

**July 12**: Engine sounds terrible. Towed to dealership. Diagnosis: seized oil control valve wrecked timing chain. Full timing assembly replacement recommended and approved.

**July 18**: Dealer finishes repairs. Invoice notes fuel rails/injectors were removed. Strong gas smell inside cabin upon pickup. Assume it'll air out.

**July 19**: Gas smell persists. Others smell it outside the car. Lightheaded after 30 minute commute. Dealership advises not to drive it if a fuel leak is suspected. Car towed back to dealership.

**July 21, late afternoon**: Dealer hasn't looked at it yet. Frustrated it wasn't prioritized after problems reported after major service.

**July 22**: Dealer claims smell is from cracked coolant hose dripping on exhaust. Tech didn’t detect gas smell while everyone else did.

**July 23**: Smell still present. Noticing distinctly worse fuel economy. Suspect ongoing leak. Do a cardboard test under the engine: confirms fuel drip.

**July 25**: Reports finding to dealer. Told to bring it in on **July 28**, only to be told to return on **July 29** for the same tech to inspect, as the tech doesn't work Mondays.

**July 29**: Dealer says it was still the coolant hose—now fixed. Claims high-temp coolant on exhaust was making a gas-like smell. Says it should clear up in a few days.

**Now**: Smell is lighter, fuel economy seems better (~26 MPG over a <2 mile drive), but no diagnostic details were provided. Still skeptical.

1mcpe3l,Do solar trickle chargers work through cigarette connections?,"Hello. I bought a solar trickle charger to keep my battery charged because my use of this vehicle is sporadic, but I am unsure if it is actually working. This is a 2001 Mazda Protege, if that helps. My concern is that there seems to be no power output to devices that are plugged into the cigarette connector when the car is off. When one turns the engine off and then continues past the point where the power windows, radio and AC work, any devices plugged into the cigarette connector are also turned off. This suggests that power to the cigarette connector is switched off. If that is the case, when the car is off and I setup the solar trickle charger through the cigarette connection, is it actually getting to the battery? Do I need to thread wires through somewhere so that it is directly connected to the battery? I would just assume that it is not working, but it seems strange that several companies give a cigarette connector for the devices, if they do not work. Perhaps they do work, but only with certain vehicles that do not turn off that connection.

This is my first post here, and I am truly grateful for any help that you can provide. I would simply test it, but I drive it just enough so that I currently only need to charge the battery about twice a year because it is so low that it will not turn over. I would prefer to not have to wait 4 to 7 months, as I charged it up recently, and I also hate being stuck while the battery is charging.

I have vac the system and held a negative pressure test for well over two hours and doesn’t budge.
When I charge it, it blows ice cold and the compressor works and obviously kicks off and on when Im running low on charge.

My mustang tends to stay cold for about a few months so Im assuming it is a very tiny leak also given the results of the negative pressure test. But granted the heat we have been getting its very noticeable that its not living up to expectations.

Earlier in the day, the battery light came on while I was driving. Later that afternoon, a few more lights on the dash lit up. When I parked and turned the car off, I tried turning it back on to take a picture of the dashboard, but the car wouldn’t start.

I jumped the car and checked the voltage at the battery — it dropped quickly and sat around 7 volts, and then after a minute or two, the car shut off again. I removed the battery and took it to AutoZone. They charged it, performed a load test, and told me the battery was fine with no issues.

When I brought the battery home, it was reading 12.99V before reconnecting it. After reinstalling it and turning the car on, the voltage dropped and hovered around 12.4 to 12.8 volts. I also checked the alternator output, and it was in the same range — around 12.4 to 12.7 volts. This makes me think the alternator isn’t working properly since it should be pushing out around 13.8 to 14.4 volts when the engine is running.

On top of that, I noticed a weird sound coming from the engine bay, and the RPMs were bouncing between 0 and 1 while the sound persisted. I used an OBD2 scanner to check for any error codes, but it came back completely clean — no codes to read or clear, which surprised me given that the battery light and other dash lights had been on.

Just to be thorough, I also checked the car’s sleep-mode battery drain and it was sitting at 0.03 amps, which seems perfectly normal — so I don’t think there’s any parasitic drain.

Kalistera (Score: 10): Just in case you are not aware, conventional is considered the lowest tier of oil in terms of performance. Synthetic blend sits just about in the middle with full synthetic being the best.

If money is not a barrier, there is legitimately no reason not to always use synthetic. You will not damage anything, and it is not going to be bad for it because it is *higher quality*. It will be better of with it in the long term.

If you are concerned about 10w30 instead of 5w30, that won't be an issue. I have many customers at our shop that request 10w30 in their older Toyotas to reduce leaking on aging seals. Doesn't stop it completely, but it can help a bit and they run just fine on that viscosity.

The only possible downside to using synthetic, in this case, is simply how long you used conventional. The synthetic/blend oils are going to have stronger cleaning additives, especially if they are high mileage branded oils. There is always a chance on higher mileage motors that a burnt, sludgey oil deposit has formed near a leak and effectively taken the place of the seal in that spot. There is a risk, although very minor, that the cleaning agents could eat through a deposit and expose a leak. I want to emphasize that it *will not create a leak* but it *may expose existing leaks*.

Personally, I wouldn't worry about it. I would recommend switching the full synthetic moving forward, though, if cost allows."

1mcl201,Issue with new alternator,"So the other day my 2003 3.4L 6cyl Tundra wouldn’t turn on and needed a jump. I had just bought a new battery from advance the year before with a warranty so I took it there. They told me my battery had died because my alternator was shot. They replaced my battery. So I drove home and left it parked until I could buy a remanufactured alternator from autozone. Here comes the juicy embarrassing detail - when I went to pry the rubber housing off of the grounding bolt with my screwdriver, I had forgotten to disconnect the negative terminal from the battery and there an electrical “pop” and fortunately I’m still alive 😂🤦🏻‍♂️. So I disconnected the battery and got the old alternator out. I put the new one in and attached everything back and made sure the belt was at the right tension. I started the car and none of my dash light, radio, ac, or odometer would come on and the battery light was on. So, I drove over to advance and they tested my battery and said it was fine but said their test showed that the alternator was bad.

So, I have a few questions. Advance said autozone must’ve sold me a dead alternator. But, I’m wondering if maybe the alternator is fine but all my fuses are shot from when I popped the grounding bolt. Or, did I destroy the wiring that hold the grounding bolt and just need to replace that somehow? Or is it really that the new alternator is just messed up from the start. 

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. I am quite a novice when it comes to working on my truck at all but really need to avoid shelling out the money to take it in to a shop for them to do the work unfortunately.

It was randomly misfiring and shaking/sputtering while driving, especially on the highway, so I wanted to change them to be safe. It ran just fine with no problems after changing them! However, we go to drive it yesterday and it starts sputtering real bad and misfiring as we’re driving down the road. Once you get the car up to around 2k RPM, it would sputter and shake and then die. Then, you’d have to turn the car off and back on to get it to move again. (It would sputter and die while still in Drive, so you’d hit the gas & nothing would happen except you rolling back, until you placed the car in park & restarted it.) I had another mechanic come & check it out & he discovered that the Ignition Coil on Cylinder 1 had blown out/burnt up and wasn’t responding (he did the unplug each ignition coil test to see which weren’t responding), so he changed that Ignition Coil on it today. However, we went to drive it, and the same thing happened! sputtering a little during idle, shaking & sputtering during acceleration, especially around 2k RPM, then it died at the stop sign. So, we brought it back home. Mechanic #2 thinks the transmission is bad and needs to be fixed because he says the transmission is slipping by the fact that it dies while still in drive. I can’t help but to feel like the spark plugs may be faulty or loose or something since it was just fine beforehand!! Unfortunately, he’s going to charge me $150 to replace the spark plugs to see if that’s the issue & I just had to pay him $250 to get the ignition coil replaced.

I got it serviced at a Hyundai dealership, and a day after getting serviced for regular maintenance and driving about 100 miles, my check-engine light turns on. Immediately went to a mechanic at an auto parts store and another at a chain carshop (Pep Boys) where I drove to, and both told me that the light's pulling knock sensor code. On top of that, oil was overfilled. I took a pic of the dipstick before the mechanic at the carshop replaced the oil to get it at the right levels.

[Image of dipstick showing oil levels.](https://preview.redd.it/09v5jjhbouff1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ae5728472e39bb3d6304c90438b6b6c1ed855e4)

Drove 100 miles back home to the dealership as soon as I could and I tell them the issues I've been told and showed them this pic. The manager tells me that (1) he couldn't tell what's stain here vs. where the actual oil level was before I had it replaced at the car shop (maybe a quart more) so the pic doesn't tell much about what their mechanic did, but regardless (2) it's normal to add a little more oil than capacity when accounting for the oil filter. No indication that there was something off with the job. They looked at the car again and said that the knock sensor issue was easily missed because ""it's deep"" and it's not something that they look into as part of their standard inspection. They agreed to cover the cost of the additional oil change I got, but nothing else so they quoted me on the knock sensor replacement at full price.

I have a couple of qs:

1. Could the overfilled oil have damaged the knock sensor?
2. If so, what could I negotiate with the dealership here? Obviously, I cannot prove that the overfilled oil was what caused the knock sensor issue, but if there's even a possibility of that happening, all of this could have been avoided if they just replaced the oil right.
3. What other information might the manager be withholding from me to avoid liability for the mechanic not having done the job right?

none, mistakes happen all the time they'd rather just fire the bad tech than burn a customer. It would cost them a whole $50 to replace that sensor, they aren't going to lie over $50. Also they didn't make a mistake here, its not dangerously full. If it was, that engine would have exploded before you left the parking lot.

Unfortunately, this car came to me with lots of issues and I’m wondering if it’s worth it to do the repairs and pay it off for credit or just sell the car and try to get alternative transportation. 

The issues found by a local repair shop:
- Torn outer tie rod boot
- Multiple leaks in the engine from coolant, oil, power steering, etc. Fastest one is the coolant, don’t notice the other ones but I suppose there’s evidence.
- Engine light on to swap the Distributor and Idle Air Control Valve
- Front and back shocks/struts are leaking 

Some pictures from their report are attached.

The car “drives rough”, when I’m sitting at a red it feels weird (kinda like purring) which they said was likely the IACF. When I turn at low speeds (ex getting in and out of parking spots) it’s really hard to turn but otherwise turns fine.

In my city most of the driving is done on the highway. I’m worried that one of these issues might occur while I’m driving and become a whole thing.

Hey! I've got a 2012 3 Series F30 320d rear wheel drive, and I'm getting some seriously strong vibrations when I take my foot off the gas at high speeds (120-140km/h).

The whole inside of the car vibrates. I've changed the engine mounts and gearbox mounts, front and rear shock absorbers, differential bushings, and I don't know what else to do.

Warm-Doughnut2633 (Score: 5): Detonation - also known as knocking or pinging, is an abnormal combustion event where the fuel-air mixture explodes rather than burning smoothly. This explosion creates a shockwave that can damage engine components. It occurs when the fuel-air mixture ignites prematurely or too rapidly, often due to factors like high compression, excessive heat, or using the wrong fuel octane. 

Engines that require higher octane actually need that higher octane. Typically this is due to engines with some kind of boost - supercharger or turbos.

1mc7836,50cc moped won't start/starts hard,"Hey gang,

My mom recently shipped her 2003 Honda metropolitan to me. It has scarcely ever been used (900 miles on it) but sat in her garage for about 15 years. I've been putting some time in getting it running, which would be fun if it weren't so damn sporadic. It's got a 49cc single cylinder 4-stroke engine. 

It took some work, but I finally had about 5 days last week where I road it to work every day. It sat over the weekend and now it's dead again. Here's the checklist I've got so far:

Carburetor: cleaned inside and out. Jets replaced, seals replaced, body got a 30 min bath in an ultrasonic cleaner w/ simple green. Vacuum line is tight. The carb doesn't have a typical mixture adjustment, just a throttle stop adjustment.

Fuel: fuel filter & pump replaced. Fuel line replaced, confirmed fuel is getting into and filling the bowl. It's got new fuel w/ fuel cleaner in the tank.

Engine: spark plug is sparky as all get out. 

Air: intake is clean, you can feel the negative pressure if you close it with your hand. 

When it ran last week, it took 2-3 min of kicking to get it started, then it would idle super low for another two minutes. Touching the throttle in this time would cause it to shut off. On Friday afternoon, I scrubbed the auto choke, which still had some fuel residue buildup inside, and it seemed to start better afterwards, but it may just have still been warm from the ride in.

In general, if it isn't starting, I can add some starter fluid to get things moving, and after that it'll keep itself running just fine. 

All told, it's getting air, it's getting fuel, I know the two are mixing because it runs *sometimes* and we've got an ignition source, so I don't know why the damn thing won't pop. I'm pretty much at the limit of my knowledge here, so any help is much appreciated.

The best method to clean a carburetor is to boil-clean it in a solution of distilled water and pine oil.

After that it's time to manual clean passages, jets etc. and replace the seals and o-ring. If you can get it for cheap an overnight bath in ChemDip is just as good, but money's always tight here.

As far as how to fix this having the hole drilled all the way through is good. The fact that it's off center and part of the old bolt is still in there a lot of times doesn't matter. If you can thread the hole and that remaining bolt material doesn't break loose the repair should be ok so long as the sensor is properly positioned to the tone ring. At the least you might need to thread this to a bolt one size larger than the original. If that's not going to work out then a helicoil or insert may be required. Just remember that you have options. You have the first part done by drilling through. Now just do whatever it takes to get a bolt to hold the sensor in.

I have a 2013 Subaru Impreza Sport Premium AWD (2.0L 4-cylinder, ~130,000 miles) that’s been sitting in Miami, FL for almost 2 years. I recently shipped the keys over so it can be moved or inspected, but I’m not physically there.

Here’s the full breakdown:
	•	Transmission is likely bad — the last time I drove it, it wouldn’t shift out of first gear. This happened after it was improperly towed.
	•	Battery is dead, and fluids (oil, trans fluid, etc.) haven’t been changed in 2 years.
	•	Minor bumper damage
	•	Mileage: ~130,000
	•	It’s completely stock, not modified.
	•	The goal is to sell it as-is, for parts or as a project.

⸻

❓ My Questions:
	1.	What would be an honest, fair price to ask for this car as-is?
	2.	Would I be better off trying to sell it to a mechanic/enthusiast, or just junk it through Peddle/Wheelzy/etc.?

1mc9hwu,Contaminated Fuel at Sunoco? Major Breakdown Right After Fill-Up – Need Advice,"Hey folks, new here. Not sure if this is the right place to post this, if not, feel free to point me in the right direction.

My fiancée and I were on a road trip, heading from my family’s place down to hers in Maryland. We stopped in Hazleton, PA to use the restroom at Starbucks. It was hot out, so I remote-started our 2013 Toyota 4Runner while we were inside to keep the AC running. The vehicle had been driving perfectly all day.

After Starbucks, we headed straight to a nearby Sunoco to fill up, we were at about half a tank. My fiancée selected premium fuel, as we’ve been using that grade consistently. We didn’t go inside the station, just fueled up and started the car while still at the pump.

As she inched the vehicle forward, I noticed a rumbling. At first she didn’t feel it, but then she did. The rumbling quickly worsened, and a moment later the A/T Temp light and Check Engine Light both came on. The vehicle lost all acceleration almost immediately. I had to get out and push it into a nearby lot, and it’s a heavy unit.

A kind passerby named Christian stopped to help us,  huge thank you to him if he’s reading this. We checked coolant levels (fine), suspected overheating or a transmission issue due to the heat and long day, and let the car cool for 40 minutes. Still nothing. No acceleration. At that point, I told her to shut it off and we called a tow truck.

Paul’s Towing came through and towed us to the Toyota dealership in Hazleton. The tech helping us, John, ran diagnostics and said the readings were all over the place. He decided to pull a fuel sample. What he found was insane: a layer of fuel about 1.5 inches thick at the bottom of a Sprite bottle, a thick black gunk layer in the middle, and a solid 1.25 inches of water sitting on top.

We’re now getting a full fuel system flush and cleaning. Thankfully, we caught it before long term damage, but this is a major delay, and we have another trip planned at the end of the week.

We retraced our stops:
	•	The last fuel-up before Hazleton was 2.5+ hours earlier — no issues the entire way.
	•	The car only broke down immediately after filling up at Sunoco.

My fiancée paid by card and has the bank record. We’re holding on to all repair paperwork and hoping to get something in writing confirming fuel contamination.

Questions:
	•	Has anyone dealt with a situation like this before?
	•	What’s the best way to report a gas station for selling bad fuel?
	•	Can we reasonably expect compensation?
	•	Is this something insurance might help with?

Any advice would be hugely appreciated. Thanks in advance, and again, shoutout to Christian and the local Toyota team for being solid in a stressful situation.

1mc5j5q,Is it worth installing a thermal imaging system on my car for night driving?,"Hi everyone,  
I wanted to get some honest opinions here. Because of my job, I often end up driving home late at night—sometimes through poorly lit or rural areas. Recently I came across automotive thermal imaging systems (basically night vision for cars), and they seem pretty cool, especially for spotting animals, pedestrians, or even vehicles in low-visibility conditions.

I’ve never used one before, but the idea of having an extra layer of visibility when driving in total darkness is pretty appealing. That said, they’re not cheap, and I’m not sure if it’s overkill or actually a worthwhile safety investment.

So I’m wondering:

* Has anyone here installed a thermal imaging or night vision system in their vehicle?
* Did it make a real difference in night driving?
* Are there specific brands or setups you’d recommend (or avoid)?

Appreciate any advice or real-world experience. Safety’s a big priority for me, but I don’t want to fall for a gimmick either.

All lights, radio, and accessories (sunroof, sub woofer) worked fine. Battery read about 12.4v, and between positive to starter solenoid was 12v when ignition was engaged. Car was in neutral and clutched fully pressed. Today after work, I bought a starter and just for giggles, I tried to start it. It did first try and right away.

Edit: So far I have pulled (what i believe to be the) starter relay and connected it to the battery and it seems to work fine. Switch engages and resistance is measured across two sets of pins while de-engergized and across the other two pins while energized. The switch instantly switches positions when the relay is energized and de-energized. I have yet to find an accurate diagram for the relays.

1mclmhj,Issue after new alternator instal,"So the other day my 2003 3.4L 6cyl Tundra wouldn’t turn on and needed a jump. I had just bought a new battery from advance the year before with a warranty so I took it there. They told me my battery had died because my alternator was shot. They replaced my battery. So I drove home and left it parked until I could buy a remanufactured alternator from autozone. Here comes the juicy embarrassing detail - when I went to pry the rubber housing off of the grounding bolt with my screwdriver, I had forgotten to disconnect the negative terminal from the battery and there an electrical “pop” and fortunately I’m still alive 😂🤦🏻‍♂️. So I disconnected the battery and got the old alternator out. I put the new one in and attached everything back and made sure the belt was at the right tension. I started the car and none of my dash light, radio, ac, or odometer would come on and the battery light was on. So, I drove over to advance and they tested my battery and said it was fine but said their test showed that the alternator was bad.

So, I have a few questions. Advance said autozone must’ve sold me a dead alternator. But, I’m wondering if maybe the alternator is fine but all my fuses are shot from when I popped the grounding bolt. Or, did I destroy the wiring that holds the grounding bolt and just need to replace that somehow?

1mcijqn,Hey! I need some help,"Hey! I hope this is allowed. I drive a 2013 Kia Soul exclaim. I’ve had it for about 5 years and it now has 162k miles. I replaced the starter a year or two ago as well as the battery  I’ve also kept up pretty well with oil changes, brakes, etc. 

Anyway, for the past few months my car has been acting up. If I idle at a stop light, in park, and sometimes while I’m actively driving it, the little pointer on my rpm drops to zero. My car still will drive and still is running however it accelerates very slow. Sometimes when this happens my car won’t run, every light on my dashboard will come on and my ac won’t blow cold air but the fans still work. Usually if this happens I pull over, turn my car off and back on. Sometimes it sputters a bit and I may have to do it a few times before it starts “normal.” I’ve attached a video of what it does when it doesn’t start normal. Sometimes my check engine light will come on while this happens and then it’ll go off after driving it a few times. 

This has been happening for a few months and seemed to be a problem every once in a while but drove fine every other time. Now, sometimes when I go to start my car, it sputters and the rpm’s stay at zero. Other times it starts fine. I know I need to go to a mechanic but I’m a college student who is financially independent from my parents and I can’t afford it at this point in time. 

Is this just a sign that my cars done and I need to look for a new one? Or could this be a simple fix? Thanks in advance for everyone’s advice!

Let's break down the symptoms you've described and try to figure out what might be going on.
Symptoms Summary:
 * Engine RPM drops to zero, car still on but running slowly: This is a key symptom. While the car is running, the RPM gauge should reflect the engine's speed. Dropping to zero while still running suggests an issue with the RPM sensor (crankshaft position sensor or camshaft position sensor) or the signal getting to the ECU/gauge.
 * Slow acceleration.
 * Engine sometimes won't run, or won't start normal.
 * Dashboard lights come on (every light).
 * AC light comes on, but no cold air and fans still work. This points to the AC compressor not engaging, which could be related to an electrical issue or the engine not running optimally.
 * Pull over, turn car off and back on to fix the issue. This is a classic symptom of a sensor issue, an electrical glitch, or a software/ECU problem that can sometimes be temporarily ""reset"" by cycling the power.
 * Sometimes sputters a bit and needs multiple attempts to start. Sputtering can indicate fuel delivery issues, ignition problems, or sensor malfunctions.
 * Check engine light comes on and then goes off after driving. This is crucial! The check engine light (CEL) indicates that the car's computer has detected a fault. The fact that it goes off means the fault is intermittent or has cleared itself, but the underlying issue remains.
Possible Causes (and what they mean):
 * Crankshaft Position Sensor (CKP) or Camshaft Position Sensor (CMP) Issues:
   * How it fits: These sensors tell the engine's computer (ECU) the position and speed of the crankshaft and camshaft. This information is vital for fuel injection, ignition timing, and RPM readings. If one of these sensors is faulty, it can lead to erratic RPM readings (dropping to zero), stalling, difficult starting, and poor performance. Intermittent failures are common with these.
   * Why it's a strong candidate: Your description of the RPM dropping to zero while the car is still on, and the car running slowly, strongly suggests a problem with how the ECU is receiving engine speed information.
 * Alternator or Battery/Charging System Issues:
   * How it fits: While you replaced the starter and battery, an intermittent alternator problem could cause voltage fluctuations that affect various sensors and the ECU, leading to the dashboard lights coming on and erratic behavior. If the car isn't getting consistent power, its systems can go haywire.
   * Why it's a possibility: While less likely to directly cause the RPM to drop to zero while the engine is running, a failing alternator can cause all sorts of electrical gremlins that could manifest as dashboard lights and general poor performance.
 * Fuel Delivery Issues (Fuel Pump, Fuel Filter, Fuel Pressure Regulator, Clogged Injectors):
   * How it fits: If the engine isn't getting enough fuel consistently, it will sputter, accelerate slowly, and might struggle to start.
   * Why it's a possibility: The sputtering and slow acceleration could point here, but it doesn't quite explain the RPM dropping to zero as clearly as a sensor issue.
 * Ignition System Issues (Spark Plugs, Coils):
   * How it fits: Faulty spark plugs or ignition coils can lead to misfires, poor performance, and difficult starting.
   * Why it's a possibility: Similar to fuel issues, it could contribute to sputtering and slow acceleration, but the RPM drop to zero is less directly explained.
 * Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor or Throttle Body Issues:
   * How it fits: These sensors measure airflow and control air intake, respectively. Problems here can cause rough idle, stalling, and poor acceleration.
   * Why it's a possibility: Could contribute to general poor running, but the RPM dropping to zero isn't a primary symptom.
 * ECU (Engine Control Unit) Problems:
   * How it fits: The ""brain"" of your car. While rare, an internal fault in the ECU could cause all sorts of bizarre and intermittent electrical and engine problems.
   * Why it's a possibility: If multiple sensors appear to be failing or if there are no clear external causes, the ECU itself could be at fault.
What to Do Next (Since you're a college student on a budget):
 * Get the Codes Read (FREE or Cheap):
   * Absolutely the first step. The check engine light is coming on, even if it goes off. This means there are stored ""trouble codes"" in the car's computer.
   * Many auto parts stores (like AutoZone, O'Reilly, Advance Auto Parts in the US; similar stores in Canada) will read these codes for free. Write down all the codes (e.g., P0XXX). These codes will be your biggest clue.
 * Focus on the Most Likely Suspects Based on Symptoms and Codes:
   * If the codes point to a crankshaft position sensor (CKP) or camshaft position sensor (CMP), that's where you start. These parts are often relatively inexpensive and can sometimes be replaced by a DIYer with basic tools, depending on their location.
   * If you get codes related to ""system too lean"" or ""misfires,"" then you might investigate fuel or ignition, but the RPM drop to zero still strongly points to a sensor.
 * Check for Loose Connections or Fuses:
   * Visually inspect wiring harnesses around the engine, especially those going to sensors. Look for anything that looks corroded, frayed, or loose.
   * Check your car's fuse box (under the hood and sometimes inside the cabin) for any blown fuses. This is a simple, free check.
 * Don't Assume the Worst (Yet):
   * While it's frustrating, the fact that cycling the power sometimes fixes it, and the Check Engine Light comes on and off, suggests an intermittent electrical or sensor issue rather than a catastrophic engine failure.
Is it a simple fix, or do you need a new car?
Based on the symptoms, it sounds like it could be a relatively simple fix, most likely a faulty sensor (like the crankshaft or camshaft position sensor) or an electrical connection issue. These are common problems in cars, especially as they age.
It's highly unlikely that you need a new car at this point, especially if the underlying issue is a sensor. Getting the codes read is paramount before making any major decisions.
In summary, your priority should be to get the trouble codes read from the check engine light. This will provide critical information to diagnose the problem accurately and avoid costly guesswork.

looking at MD checklist, they do look for exhaust. it indicates audibly and visually. whether that means they allow an aftermarket, is hard to say, especially with the SLP being bullet style.

Anyway, for the past few months my car has been acting up. If I idle at a stop light, in park, and sometimes while I’m actively driving it, the little pointer on my rpm drops to zero. My car still will drive and still is running however it accelerates very slow. Sometimes when this happens my car won’t run, every light on my dashboard will come on and my ac won’t blow cold air but the fans still work. Usually if this happens I pull over, turn my car off and back on. Sometimes it sputters a bit and I may have to do it a few times before it starts “normal.” I’ve attached a video of what it does when it doesn’t start normal. Sometimes my check engine light will come on while this happens and then it’ll go off after driving it a few times. 

This has been happening for a few months and seemed to be a problem every once in a while but drove fine every other time. Now, sometimes when I go to start my car, it sputters and the rpm’s stay at zero. Other times it starts fine.

You’re looking to modify a car with no aftermarket support for what you are trying to do. This means a lot of time. A lot of money. A lot of hidden costs and a lot of knowledge. If you have to ask questions like “how do I support this dream?” You need to be having a custom shop handle the entire project and give you a quote. The quote they will give you will be less cost effective then just buying a Subaru forester. 

So my best recommendation would be to ask a local Subaru dealer what they have on their lot. Just being honest with you man. You’re talking about likely spending like well over 10k on work to have an open diff, front wheel drive over landing vehicle that will be a big pothole while fully loaded away from totaling out your shock towers."

One tip was to reset the system by pulling the HVAC fuze and let the AC run with engine off for 2 minutes. Unfortunately didn't help.

Here's some symptoms. 

I see breather neck always spill coolant. And sometimes there's steam coming out. So im constantly losing coolant.

Here's what I have done.

Compression test. OK
Checked with camera on piston (didnt look like it had steam as it was bit black not shinny)
pumped 20 psi on cooling system left it for 4 hours. It stayed at 20 psi. With all spark plugs out. 
Did headgasket block tester. Fluid turned greenish. As I read online some telling me its reaction to coolant steam. So it is not positive but ob youtube I see it turns bright yellow or greenish yellow. 

Here's what I noticed.

Nissan 370z is pretty annoying to bleed so I lift car nose up to make the reservoir highest point. It bubble as it had lost 1.5L coolant after 2100 kilometres (1400ish miles). After 40+ minutes it stayed okay then I noticed VERY small bubbles when I tried to pop them they simply move i tried stirring it. 


So anyone who tried this bottle tell me if this indicate headgasket or not. As each bottle uses different dye. 

That's all I am asking and thank you.

The actual repair went relatively smooth (albeit more more than 3-4 hours), but I could not survive taking apart my car without my dumbassery rearing its ugly head. Both ChatGPT and my YouTube repair video, who were my Sherpas on this journey, had the brilliant idea of putting some crinkled up paper towels in the intake cylinders to make sure no debris got in there. 

What a disaster that would be.

Oh the irony.

My YouTube video concluded with basically “put things back where you found them” and as I deliberately asked ChatGPT for a checklist of things to do/check before I fire it up, we were both completely too caught up in finishing our first major repair to remember the damn paper towel debris blockers. She purred for half a second and then she putted, gasped, and died. Any future attempts were similar gasping before I decided to investigate further. This is when ChatGpt finally mentioned to think about any tape, gloves or rags I could have left in the engine during the repair.

Ensue panic. 


I opened up the manifold, and found what was left of 6 paper towels in each of the six cylinders. 

I tried to fish out as much as I could with just the upper intake manifold off but ultimately resorted to pulling the lower manifold as well as this stuff was stubborn. After around an hour per cylinder, I really don’t think I can get anymore out. It seems that there are a few fibers caught up right at the piston opening within each cylinder. 

Now ChatGPT is trying to save ass and be very overly cautious. It wants me to:
1. Remove spark plugs
2. Hand crank to turn the engine 
3. Vacuum out remaining debris from combustion chamber

(You could theoretically blow compressed air in the cylinder with the manifold off and try to blow anything out that way.  You would have to manually rotate the engine until the intake valve was open.)  I think get the camera and look first, but I'm just an average guy, so what do I know?

Btw, anything that gets blown through when the car is running may end up in your catalytic converter.  I could see that also causing a difficult start up.  However, if you get it running, again I think it would eventually burn off.

I am quite disappointed with the mechanic I took my car to, as it was supposed to be a good one (private big garage in industrial area with quite some good reviews).

I own a Peugeot 206 with 170.000ish Km, as I bough it second hand I don’t have much idea of the maintenance the car has undergone.

It was low of oil when I got it, easy fix, car runs smooth. I took it to a kwikfit for a full service and some thing got fixed.

Last month the breaks started to chime quite loudly, but the car breaks good. As the gear stuck is quite wobbly I decided to take it to the garage and ask for a check on the brakes, new gear linkeages and new trans fluid as I have no record of it even been done…

A being in my car at 8 am sharp, collect it at 17h after they calling at 16:30: as I arrive I am met with a 80€ bill. They said they took the car for a ride and check the breaks and didn’t hear anything nor see any problem. Fine, I say to myself, can happen.
My surprise comes when they say that the wobble is normal for the km (no shit, that’s why I asked for new linkages) and that they didn’t change the trans fluid because it wouldn’t fix the wobble and WOULD BREAK the gearbox. Only solution is to change the gearbox but is not worth the money according to them (and to me..)


I think the reception lady lied to my face with no shame about a fluid change breaking the box, am I crazy?

1mc1ah2,VSC/Check Engine/Dead Car After Wheel Service – 2009 Lexus ES350,"I’m having a strange issue with my 2009 Lexus ES350 and hoping someone here can help me figure it out.

A few days ago, I had all four wheels serviced and replaced, and immediately afterward, the orange triangle warning light showed up on the dash. The car was still driving fine, so I didn’t think it was anything urgent.

Then today, while I was out driving, the Check Engine light, traction control light, and brake light all came on at the same time, and the dash displayed “Check VSC.” I pulled into my driveway, shut off the engine, and then noticed that the car wouldn’t lock afterward.

Later, I went out to try to take it to O’Reilly’s to get the code checked, but now the car won’t even power on or start. It’s completely dead.

Has anyone experienced something like this before?

Could it be related to the wheel replacement?

Is this electrical? Sensor-related? Something else?

Could the battery or alternator be the culprit?

It’s very unlikely it’s related to the wheel service. Would really have nothing to do with that. 

>the orange triangle warning light showed up on the dash. The car was still driving fine, so I didn’t think it was anything urgent.

Anytime a light comes on, treat it as urgent. That’s their purpose. Regardless of if the car seems to be driving fine. Light comes on that means the computer sees something that isn’t right and telling you to look at that. You find out why it’s on and then when you have that get a professional opinion on whether it’s something seriously urgent or just needs to be addressed soon. Continuing to drive when a light pops on could cause damage or leave you in a bind somewhere down the road.

Fuzzywink (Score: 21): I'm assuming the battery the seller is talking about is the little 12v standard car battery and not the hybrid battery.  There isn't really a viable way to charge the hybrid battery without the car running to charge it so their wording suggests it is the 12v that isn't charging.  

On most cars that would sound like a failing alternator, but hybrids are a bit different.  They generally don't have an alternator in the form of a little belt driven generator on the side of the engine.  Typically they have a whole assembly that is part of the hybrid system and uses the same hardware to charge the big battery via the engine or regen braking and also acts as an electric motor to assist the engine in moving the car.  The power for the 12v system comes from the high voltage system, so the problem could be more involved to track down compared to a non-hybrid.  Could be super simple or it could not be.  

In either case $700 for a running'ish car with a clean title that isn't folded in half is a steal these days.  I would jump on this in a second.  Getting it working properly to drive it would be ideal, but even giving up and parting it out would turn a profit."

Heater Core (as the car no longer blows hot air during the winter time) - I believe there was a recall for my car with that issue. 
AC Blower Motor - I believe the fan blades are broken because when I turn it to 3 and higher, its unbearably loud. 
All 4 Tires - I had it replaced prior to it sitting in the garage for 3 years and the front right one was flat. He told me that because it was sitting for so long, he recommends replacing it. 
All 4 brakes and rotors - I know the front two needed replacing but he told me because the car sat for so long, hes going to replace all 4
Windshield - windshield got cracked during the winter time so hes replacing it. 
DPF Delete - my main issue. The DPF was one of the main reason why I had the car sitting for so long. He told me that hes going to delete the DPF so it shouldnt be an issue afterwards. 
Oil Change. 

I was quoted $2900 CAD to get everything replaced and brand new. I would like to know if this is a reasonable quote or should I find something else? According to my family, this is only for all the parts and thus, isn’t charging for labour. Thank you for your feedback!

We’ve had it 4 months but let them know of the error within 2 weeks, but now are thinking of giving the car back and getting a refund. Do we have any rights to do this?

The main reason I'm buying the corolla is for reliability + safety features as I do shift work with 30k miles covered a year. Some other non negotiables would be heated seats, wireless car play and rear view camera which I believe comes on the icon trim.

The link they sent took me to a page where it basically detailed all of the services they could offer me (vehicle hire, vehicle repair etc), i assumed this was his insurance contacting me which i was really confused by, there was no detail of the actual incident and it didn’t state if a claim had actually been made against me or not? in fact the letter implied im the one who’s made the claim (phrases like “We can assist you in your claim” and things alike) i messaged the other party to ask for his insurance company just to check but he gave me a different company, i mentioned that a different company contacted me to which ive been ghosted. I informed my insurance company about the whole situation, they’ve said they haven’t received anything on their end and it seems a tad fishy. 

But i’m confused, what the hell am i meant to do? I agreed to the offer of services from that random company, they had literally all my details other than my name which they butchered. i was absolutely mortified about the whole ordeal so i stupidly agreed without much thought but having googled the company they literally have 1.5stars which shocked me quite frankly and i dont believe he’s even informed his own insurance about the incident. Is this third party capture/assistance? I really cannot tell what is in it for me, am i going to have to pay up or what? If i pursue this third party assistance will that affect my premiums and ncd the same way going through my own insurance would? (i ask this because i am a young driver so having my insurance go up would drain the life out of me). I just need some guidance on this situation because i am so lost. Will it be better for me to just go through this random third party? i know it sounds stupid but if it wont effect my premiums, i dont need any compensation or anything as my car is undamaged so if it means i can just pay for his repair given i am the one who hit it (again, not 100% sure it was me) without too much faff i would probably prefer that rather than getting my own insurance involved and skyrocketing my renewal price.

Any help is appreciated!! Thank you so much guys


UPDATE: The claimant has taken this up with my insurance company now, i am still a bit overwhelmed by the whole situation as i did not expect it all to blow up over a light scuff! i trust my insurance company to handle this matter and will not be communicating with the other party or anyone else from here onwards. As a young driver i am especially bummed that if anything were to increase the price of my insurance it would be this of all things, guessing i wont be in the hundreds any time soon lol, again, i am still not 100% certain i caused the scuff in question as he did mention he had a similar situation before but didn’t elaborate, so for now i have asked for the situation to he looked into just to be absolutely certain.

1mcfvrt,How do you identify when a car is uneconomical to repair and needs to go?,"Hello everyone,

I drive a Mazda 2 from 2009, bought it for about £1k last year when I passed my test with about 130k miles on the clock and it’s been going strong since. Just needed very small maintenance here and there (little issue with wishbone, blown bulbs, leaking brake fluid etc), probably haven’t spent more than £300 maintaining it during the past year or so.

I recently returned from a long stay away from home and I checked the fluid levels under the bonnet, and I noticed that the coolant had fallen quite significantly.

Took it to my local mechanic as it also had a blown headlight, and he had a check. Turns out the radiator is leaking and will probably cost £150-200 to repair and replace. It isn’t that serious for now, we just topped up the coolant with some water and will continue to run the car. The cv joints on 2 of the wheels also need replacing.

1mcf9ld,Peugeot 208 engine failure on finance – stuck with a £9k bill for a non-running car,"Hi all, looking for advice or if anyone’s had similar experiences.

We’ve got a 2019 Peugeot 208 1.2L PureTech on finance. There’s about £9,000 left to pay – or £7,999 if we settle the finance early. The engine completely failed this April at just under 55,000 miles, only four months after the wet belt was replaced. We’ve only had the car since January 2024.

We had an independent mechanic inspect it, and they confirmed the engine failure was due to *no oil* being in the system. But oil was definitely added at the last service – so we’re not sure what’s happened. The repair is estimated at £6,000, which is about the same as the car’s current value.

We spoke to the finance company (MotoNovo) and they gave us four options:

* **Settle the finance at £7,999**, but that leaves us with a dead car and a £6k engine repair bill.
* **Part-exchange** – though we’re not sure how that would work given the engine is gone.
* **Voluntary termination** – but we’d have to pay any outstanding balance, which could include the cost of repair or the difference between the sale price at auction and what we owe.
* **Scrap the car**, but again, we’d still owe the remaining finance.

We’ve got 3 years left on the agreement, and we’re basically stuck with a car that doesn’t run and a mountain of debt, even though the fault wasn’t ours.

Has anyone dealt with something like this on PCP or HP? Are there any other options we can explore, like complaints to the dealer, legal action, or going through insurance?

Any advice would be massively appreciated!

  
**Edit:** Since posting, I’ve had confirmation from the garage that they used Shell Helix Ultra 0W-20 PSA B71 2010 oil at the time of the wet belt change. However, this spec is no longer recommended for the 1.2 PureTech engine. The independent engineer found no oil on the dipstick, metallic debris near the A/C compressor, and suspects the engine is seized from oil starvation. The wet belt was intact and fitted correctly, but the exact cause (blocked pickup, oil pump failure, or incorrect oil) can’t be confirmed without opening the engine. I’ve gone back to the garage to ask further questions about the work they did.

1mcf8sc,Misrepresented car purchase from dealer - options?,"I recently purchased an EV from a used approved dealer.

The car is a 70 plate, 1 owner, has only done 25k miles and the history is roughly as follows:

Nov 2020 - Registered

Nov 2021 - Service 1: 5,500 miles

July 2022 - Vehicle Health Check: 11,500 miles

Nov 2023 - Service 2: 20,000 miles

Feb 2025 - Service 3: 25,000 miles


The car has done low mileage and has clearly been very well looked after, and a battery State of Health check shows it as being 100%. 

At the time, I was reassured verbally by the dealer that this history constituted full service history (it’s also all main dealer history with receipts), and that the first service should be after 10k miles/1yr, with the next one coming after another 20k/2 year gap, then within every 2 years thereafter.

However, I’ve done my research (as I was getting a lot of mixed messages depending on year, brand, model), and it transpires that it *should* have had a service in Nov 2022 to maintain FSH - even though it’d mainly be an inspection based service. I guess you could also argue the Feb 2025 one was ‘late’

I love the car, and it’s clearly been well looked after - I want to keep it, and I’ve even got a three year warranty. But I’m pissed off at myself for believing the dealer who convinced me that this counts as FSH.

Don't give a garage free reign to come up with a list of issues they've found or what might need doing soon, unless it also matches up with what you think too (you drive the car regularly so should notice...).

I’m in a frustrating situation and could use some advice.



I’ve been parking my car in the same bay for about 4 months with no restrictions or signs at all. Then, just yesterday, the council installed new parking restriction signs. Today, they impounded my car and are charging me £360 to get it back.



The kicker? I’ve never received a single PCN or warning during those months of parking there lawfully.



So while the removal isn’t technically retroactive since the signs were up before they impounded the car, it feels really unfair to be hit with such a huge charge right after suddenly introducing restrictions—especially with no prior notice or PCNs issued.

If the damage is minor (eg you didn't need to recover it and you drove it home) AND you buy it back, the car will likely stay in your possession. I've done that at least three times. You don't have to hand over the car for all and every claim.

One time I had to drop it off at a garage of their choosing for a week so they could assess it but that's about it. The other times it was either sending them pictures or them sending an assessor to me.

1mc5v0g,Is this BMW 5 Series a red flag? Looks like it's been trashed,"Hey everyone,

​I'm looking at a 2019 BMW 520i M Sport Auto with ~52,000 miles, priced at £18,940. On the surface, it seems like a decent deal (""Good price"" according to the advert), but after looking at the MOT history, I'm getting some serious cold feet and it honestly looks like the car has been thrashed and not looked after at all.

​I've attached screenshots of the advert and the last two MOTs (March 2024 and March 2025).My biggest concern is the repeated advisory: ""Undertrays fitted not allowing full inspection of the underneath of the vehicle."" 

This immediately raises a red flag for me. It sounds like the previous owner might have damaged the original undertray, and rather than fixing it properly or replacing it with one that has the proper inspection covers, they've just bodged something on. What are your thoughts on this? Has anyone encountered this advisory before? Could this be hiding more significant damage or issues underneath?

​Beyond that, the repeated tyre advisories (especially ""requires replacing"" on the 2024 MOT for the offside front) and the worn brake components, combined with the shock absorber bush issues, make me question how well this car has been maintained. It seems like a lot of wear and tear for its mileage and age, especially for a relatively premium car like a 5 Series.

And the dealer mentioned it could be an ex-demo car, as the second owner took ownership in January 2020, but he isn't sure.

​What do you all think? Is this just typical for a car of this age/mileage, or are these genuine red flags that I should walk away from? Any insights, especially regarding the undertray issue, would be greatly appreciated!

1mc5q81,Why is car service in the UK so bad/soulless?,"I was just charged £700 for a “coolant leak diagnostic” at a third-party garage in the middle of nowhere — and it made me stop and ask myself: why is car service in the UK so bad?

As someone originally from Eastern Europe, I find the car service quality here incredibly frustrating. If I had to describe it in three words: slow, overpriced, and soulless.

There’s no passion for the craft. No curiosity about how cars work, no interest in figuring out problems properly, no effort to fix things correctly. People just want to run diagnostics, charge you a fortune, and move on.

I never quite understood the hype around Mat Armstrong on YouTube. Don’t get me wrong — he’s great — but people here seem absolutely amazed by what he does. Meanwhile, where I come from, this level of DIY and technical skill is fairly normal.

Now I think I get it. He’s the pinnacle of car culture in the UK. When he makes a custom part, it’s treated like some Formula 1-level engineering.

Another thing that opened my eyes was attending several car exhibitions. Many of the “project cars” that looked great on YouTube or in photos were actually poorly built and badly assembled in real life — not even close to what you’d expect from a YouTube-quality build not a “exhibition” ready car.

So here’s my genuine question:
Are people in the UK just not interested in proper car service and maintenance?
Is it like how no one seems to care about clean toilets in cafés or restaurants?
Or has nobody here ever been shown what good service actually looks like?

Upd:
Just to clarify, my experience with the last service was only the trigger for this post. My opinion is based on a long list of interactions with various independent specialists over the years.
I do get that there are some good guys here and there — but overall, it feels like the country standard is set by mediocre mechanics working in mediocre garages, with a low level of passion for what they do and its way to hard to find someone different.

Any information would be greatly appreciated, Thanks",3,1753770110.0,20,CartalkUK,1753872317,2025-07-29 06:21:50,2025-07-30 10:45:17,"Yoguls (Score: 20): Yes, I believe you would have to meet both those criteria.

Although mot isnt a particularly high standard, its always worth getting one done, even if its over 40 years old and exempt, in the event of an accident there will probably be some insurance company arguing the toss to try and wiggle out of paying the fully comp aspect should the worse happen to your pride and joy even though its exempt.

I once wound it up to a fairly rapid pace (on an unrestricted road in the Isle of Man) and nearly shat my pants when I tried to brake (not even particuarly sharply). I had the brakes checked and they were fine, but the guy at the (independent Volvo specialist) garage said the brakes on these were notorious, and the police specified upgraded brakes when they purchased Volvos. The V70 may have better brakes as standard.  
  
The other thing is the air con evaporator is prone to getting pinholes. It's a full dash-out job to replace it. Again, this may have been sorted in the V70.

1mc2hqw,DIY DPF OFF + WinOLS Help – VW Jetta 1.6 TDI EDC17C46 (Beginner Trying to Learn),"Hey everyone, I’m working on a DIY DPF OFF for my 2011 VW Jetta 1.6 TDI (EDC17C46) and could really use some help from people who’ve done this before.

I’ve extracted the original .bin using KESS V2 clone (Red PCB) and installed WinOLS 2.24 on a clean offline setup. My plan is to edit the file myself (no pre-made solutions), and I want to understand what I’m doing

At the moment, I haven’t touched the DPF yet — I’m still deciding what decision to give my mechanic to do, either:

Clean the DPF (chemical + pressure wash)

Or gut it (open and remove ceramic inside)



Here’s where I need help with:

Best way to identify and remove DPF logic in WinOLS manually? or does anyone have a damos  or software for DPF Remover, I've seen some online.

Any tips for removing just the relevant DTCs (P2002, P2453, etc.) without disabling useful fault detection?

Do I need to worry about checksums if I only edit the DPF maps?

If I keep the DPF physically in place (just cleaned), will ECU still throw faults later without full software delete?

I'm trying to learn, not just copy. If anyone can share tips, damos, map packs, or even screenshots of their own projects, I’d really appreciate it.

Thanks in advance — I’ll post the results when it’s done.",1,1753764685.0,1,CartalkUK,1753872317,2025-07-29 04:51:25,2025-07-30 10:45:17,reddit-is-a-psy-op- (Score: 0): Ask chatGPT and head to the VW enthusiast forums - you might get lucky here but I'd imagine those places are better.

As to reattaching it, looks like part of it has broken off the back of the upper rubber retainer that holds it in place. Probably will need replacement. You could probably use silicone sealant to temporarily hold it in place, taping it while it cures."
