1ob4rn7,First time using a noco charger. Worried it’s overcharging my 12v battery.,My 2003 civic hasn’t been driven in awhile and battery died. I first bought the noco genius 1 and charged for a total of 17 hours starting yesterday. I got a multimeter today and wanted to check voltage. The noco indicated it was under 75 percent charged but when I removed charging cables and read it with multimeter it was 12.63 volts. How is that under 75%? This is my first time using one of these and they are supposed to be very reliable and not overcharge. Does the battery read higher then it actually is after removing the charger and im getting a false reading or do some batteries go higher then 12.6-12.8? I heard thats the range they are considered full… or at least above 75% I would think. Any advice would help.

My issue:
This attempt the engine was shut off after about a minute (I stopped on purpose), it was only to test that it is running ok and no unusual knocking or ticking sounds and no leaks, Which it didn't have. About an hour later we were planning to bring it up to operating temperature to allow coolant to flow around the engine We started the engine, and oddly enough it struggled a small bit more than expected, but once started it idled fine. 
After about 5-7 mins it started to have a bit of a rough idle, engine was quite jumpy and it didn't sound/feel right, kind of felt like some sort of misfire. I shut off the engine, I read a P062D code, ""fuel injector driver circuit performance issue"". And after this the engine wouldn't start no matter how much cranking was done.

2) once you start to flush your system, you will find the leaks begin to pop up everywhere - this is because the rust is somewhat self-sealing, and as you flush it away, you are also flushing the “rust” that is currently sealing your system. This is an extended and anger-ridden path. 

3) flush your coolant system and replace everything- hoses, seals, water pump, heater core. This is a big job, but done once highly rewarding and not very intensive (aside from heater core)

I went to a junkyard and got the 3 screws, but how do I get the old broken off ends out of the engine? They are about a half-inch inside the hole.

Even if I were to use a bypass pulley, I see the screws are shorter for it but I'd still have the same issue I think...

Heard a ticking noise from the engine while driving on the highway and the check engine light came on. Pulled the code, turned out to be a misfire on cylinder 2.

Checked the spark plugs and found a small bent piece on one of them that had broken off and was causing the ticking noise. I was able to fish the broken piece out of the cylinder.

The coils didn’t look great either (see pics), so I went ahead and replaced all four coils and all the spark plugs while I was at it.

Now the code’s gone and the car’s idling way smoother than before, but I’m still a little worried that the broken piece from the spark plug might’ve caused some internal damage. I don’t have a borescope yet to check inside, but at least compression looks good….

I get home and turn the truck off and hear a pop from what sounded like the passenger side. The truck wouldn’t start. It lost all power. Nothing happened when I turned the key. 

I unplug the fuse box under the hood for 10 seconds, plug it back in.. truck fires up… has check engine lights. All stuff for parking assist it seems… but I have no auto start or cruise control.

Yesterday I noticed the alarm is going off all on its own. Happened at the party store yesterday, then twice today sitting in my driveway. 

I would like to say, I did blast the fuel deck door real good, it was grimy and sticky when opening and closing. I also had a sticker on drivers side front window and some water could have gone down past the seal at the bottom of the window but I didn’t blast it directly down so can’t say for sure.

During these 7 months, the pan held the oil just fine. However, there are two reasons I suspect the thread is at the very least deformed:

1) when removing the oil plug before the oil change, an abnormal (in my limited experience) amount of force was required
2) when replacing the plug with a brand new one, while screwing it in, the amount of force required was very variable throughout, and right towards the end the plug rotated suspiciously easily and with very slight force

As I don't want to get caught with a drained pan that I can't fill back in my garage and having to call a tow truck, I want to be prepared for the eventuality the thread needs indeed to be fixed.

I'm looking for suggestions: do you think I should just get a new oil pan, and if so, is aftermarket good enough? Is it difficult to get it mounted without a lift?

Replaced coolant reservoir cap, as the old one was a bit damaged. No leaking after that was replaced. Oil dipstick looks fine. Transmission fluid looks fine.

Drained old coolant. It wasn't completely draining, maybe because it was too thick? Filled with distilled water. Drained that too. Filled with more distilled water. It only wants to hold about 1.5 gallons of distilled water. After the first gallon, the water takes forever to go down. Have tried starting car and pressing on the gas to try and burp the system. Only helps slightly. The heater in the car is getting hot. Temperature gauge is slightly below midway. Going to drain what's in there now, fill with water and flushing chemical mix, drive. Then drain and replace with new correct coolant.

1oayuhf,Volvo XC90 AWD diesel Turbo broke after checkup,"Hello everyone, something terrible happened to me and I could use some advice.

I recently brought my **Volvo XC90 (year 2007)** to a local shop for regular maintenance — an oil change, filter replacement, and a new timing belt. The car was running perfectly fine before this service.

After picking it up, I drove about **150 km**, and then an **engine fault** appeared. The car suddenly lost power, and I couldn’t drive faster than **50–60 km/h**.

I brought it back to the same mechanic, and they told me the **EGR valve** needed to be replaced, giving me an **estimate of €1,000**. The price seemed high, so I decided to get a second opinion.

At a different workshop, the mechanic discovered that the **EGR valve wasn’t the only issue** — the **turbocharger** was also not working, and **oil was leaking through the exhaust**. The pipe leading to the EGR was **completely clogged with black residue**. Unfortunately, this mechanic didn’t have time to open and inspect the turbo further, but he noticed the turbo was not original meaning it was replaced not too recently, but he estimated that repairing everything would cost around **€3,500**.

He also advised me **not to tell the first shop** that another mechanic had checked the car. According to him, if I mentioned that, the original shop might refuse responsibility and claim that the other mechanic caused the damage.

Now I’m not sure what to do. I see two options:

1. **Go back to the original shop**, ask them to repair the EGR, and hope they notice the turbo problem themselves — possibly admitting their mistake and covering the cost through their insurance.
2. **Take the car to an official Volvo service center**, get a full diagnostic report, and then return to the first shop with the report, hoping they will take responsibility and cover the repair costs.",1,1760902536.0,2,MechanicAdvice,1760988880,2025-10-19 19:35:36,2025-10-20 19:34:40,"3X7r3m3 (Score: 1): Did you buy it used?

This is a project car for my 17-year-old son’s first vehicle. I picked it up at auction with the idea that he could learn by working on it, make a few mistakes without too much pressure, and have a solid first ride that is not too precious to mess up.

Right now, we are stuck on the brakes. The SUV has new rotors, pads, and calipers all around, plus two new rear brake lines. After replacing the hoses and calipers, we could not get the brakes to bleed properly. I bought an AGM pressure bleeder and a FOXWELL NT630 Plus OBD2 scanner with ABS function from Amazon, but still no luck. This weekend even replaced the master cylinder.

We have gone through about three liters of DOT 4 fluid, cycling the ABS and emergency brake multiple times. Each time, we followed the usual order: rear passenger, rear driver, front passenger, and finally front driver. We tried both pressure bleeding and the traditional pump and hold method for about four hours with no success.

Is there a trick or something specific we might be missing with this system? Any advice would be appreciated.

Your buddy keeps holding the pedal until it reaches the floor, at which point he will yell “floor!”. At this point, your buddy should still be on the pedal. You should be closing the bleeder at this point, and only after the bleeder is fully closed, does he let off and pump the brakes again.

**Edit: people before you say ""Its an assembly dummy and should be replaced as an assembly newbie"", Components ARE serviceable but as an assembly its NLA from VW, its not available in another make/model, AND used samples will have the same problem.**

My buddy has a 2008 VW twin-turbo V10 diesel Touareg. Its headlight assembly is only used on the 2008, so a one off. He took it to his local mechanic because some of the wire covering (the plastic sheath) had just crumbled off in his hands. The local shop said no thanks, just but a new headlight assembly. That headlight assembly, off Ebay, is $2200 as VW doesn't have one. Screw that, I said I'm sure I can fix it based on his description.

For forward a few hours and we get his headlight assembly which, actually is crazy simple and requiring zero tools.

There is a control module that unclips and has ALL of the internal wires going thru it. I moved that out of the way to see, oh wow, yeah the tiny yellow accessory bulb's socket is fine but the two wires to it are completely bare, just stranded copper wire. But as I started inspecting all of the other wires I found exposed wire after exposed wire after exposed wire. My initial plan looked like:

• de-pin the terminal, find a replacement, replace the wire, crimp new lead terminal, easy peasy

Nope, that wasn't going to happen because:  
• The pin terminals on one side are PCB mounted  
• The terminals I could get loose are something I had never seen before  
• All the wires are solid black, except for three which had a white stripe  
• The more I moved the wire the more the wire covering was flaking off so I manipulated all the wires to get all the covering off what was going to come off

Let me reiterate, VW made the functional choice to make ALL of the wires black. All of the them. Sooooo how do we identify the wires?

A little history:  GM changed from 5w30 to 0w20 in most of their late 20-teens and early 2020s cars to improve fuel economy in light of sharply rising CAFE standards while not always tightening engine internal component (i.e. bearing) tolerances and finish specifications.  They get 1-2% more mpg, which is worth tens of millions of $ to them in CAFE fines and gas guzzler taxes.

But lower oil weight means lower viscosity which means less film barrier keeping the metal parts from grinding themselves into oblivion and taking your engine and wallet with it.

The GDI L84 that debuted in 2019 was originally specified and presumably originally designed for 0w20 engine oil.  If this presumption is correct, then it will have bearing and journal roughness tolerances which are more strict than what they had previously in engines with 5w30 or 0w40 spec oils.   I do not know what those tolerance specs are, but that is what is required (and what Asian MFRs have done) to be able to handle the lower barrier film thickness that results from using lower weight (viscosity) oils.

However, GM's track record on keeping to their own rules and specs is not great.  GM has knowingly changed manufacturing suppliers for cost savings which resulted in parts with worse surface roughness outside of the tolerances required for 0w20.

Here's a little story time as an example.  You may or may not have heard about the problems with the 6.2L L87 engine.   GM screwed up royally when they moved crank production from GM's captive Tonawanda NY plant to a 3rd party Tier 1 supplier in Mexico in 2020 for the 2021 production year.  And bad parts with out of spec journal roughness were produced for FOUR YEARS.  This has created the current nightmare of recall issues, bogus pico tests that rarely fail even on obviously knocking engines, and oil spec changes on that engine to quite literally cover up the rough bits.  With the spec change earlier this year to 0w40, GM is trying to bandaid/slime their way out of warranty liability on the rough cranks in millions of $50k-$100k MSRP V8 trucks and SUVS from the poor cost/quality choice that Mary signed off on.  They're doing that because it will be cheaper to deal with the inevitable retroactive EPA fines for the 1-2% lower fleet average mpg than spend $billions to install millions of replacement L87 engines in everything they've built in the last 4 years.  And all those replacement cranks are still made by that very same Tier 1 in MX.    Bad juju that.  Try to save a buck, screw up a good thing, try to weasle out of making it right to your customers, waste money instead of saving it, piss off the customers and wreck the brand reputation.  But that's GM being GM.  It's who they are and what they do.  Shame. Shame.

On the bright side, your L84 crankshaft was made in Tonawanda, and final assembly was in Tonawanda or St. Catherines in Ontario, so you're unlikely to ever get rolled up in that mess.  So be very glad you have the 5.3, not the 6.2, and sleep comfortably at night knowing at at least GM didn't screw that up on your car.

So back to you and your oil choices.  Once it's out of warranty, use whatever you want.   I'd recommend a 0w30 or 5w30 in summer if you live somewhere warm, and keep the 0w20 for now if your winters are cold and change to 0w30 next spring.

1oavy4q,Engine making clicking noise when accelerating after receiving oil change - please help!,"My 2007 Toyota Corolla engine is making a clicking/ticking noise when I accelerate and press down on the gas pedal after receiving an oil change. The oil change was done by a mechanic I have used for years and he has a reputation for being super honest and reliable. The clicking noise seems to go away after driving for about 15+ miles. I brought it back into the mechanic who did the oil change and he checked things out said he couldn’t find anything. (However, I brought it in after I had driven 20 miles so it wasn’t making the clicking noise, I’m going to try to bring it back while it is actively making the noise, just harder to time it that way.) 

To summarize:
-engine is making a clicking noise when accelerating (not while idling) after receiving an oil change

-oil change was done by a reputable mechanic and not a jiffy lube type place

-the car was absolutely not making this sound prior to the oil change

-Although it’s an old car, I have always kept up with timely oil changes and maintenance and the car is in great condition 

-noise seems to go away after driving for 15+ miles

I just got an offer to do my internship at a Subaru dealership, and I could really use some advice from experienced mechanics before I decide.

I’m still in auto school. The thing is, Subaru mainly uses boxer engines, and I’m a bit worried that if I spend all my training time on those, it might not help me much when I need to work on inline or V engines later in my career.

Do you think starting at Subaru is a good choice for someone who’s just beginning their professional mechanic journey?  
Will the skills and experience still transfer well if I move to another brand later?

Will I understanding inline or V engines ?

I got the catalytic converter changed after the drive because the check engine light was on, after getting it changed the check engine light came back on after a week, took it to the mechanic and they put it a new purge solenoid. Drove it for a week then the check engine light came on again. Brought it back to the mechanic and they thought it was the O2 sensor, then realized it was actually the air fuel ratio sensor. They fixed the light and after driving it for a week the check engine light just came back on ugh.

I would love opinions: Should I try running premium fuel / fuel injector fluid through it and see if that fixes the check engine light? Or should I take it back to the mechanic. Like is it really bad to drive it around for a week or 2 with the check engine light on? 

This is the code that came up for the check engine light.

I’ll offer a different viewpoint depending on what your time is valued to you and how much you expect to get out of this vehicle left. If you’re around somewhere with a lot of rust and only because I’ve been here.. (former 02 Accord owner) these ball joints are pressed into the knuckle, often enough rust welded in there and can be a nasty ass and laborious job that would suck ass to do twice, let me recommend to you some things to consider.. an original Honda ball joint from a place like HondaPartsNow (a dealer’s site) is $150ish. Yea, much more expensive, but as long as you install it correctly, it’s much less chances of going bad in only 20k miles. 

 There are also preloaded knuckles from RockAuto that includes the ball joint already pressed into for you as well as a new wheel bearing and hub. Just something to consider because I know this job sucks on rusty vehicles.

I have a 2006 Mazda 3. I recently installed a new battery, and right after that, I started getting this issue. 

The first time, the AT light came on right after startup. The car wouldn’t shift gears and felt like it was stuck in 3rd (limp mode). After about 5 minutes, the light went off and it started driving and shifting normally again. 

A few days later, while driving on the highway, I heard a loud bang, the car shook, the AT light came on again, and the car went back into 3rd gear. Two seconds later, it went back to normal. This started happening every ~30 minutes.

I brought it to a garage and left it there for 2 weeks. When they tried to start it, my new battery was completely dead — turns out there was a short circuit, which they fixed. They drove the car afterward, and everything worked perfectly. The AT light never came back on, and there were no stored codes when they checked with the computer.

Today, I picked it up and drove it for about 30 minutes on the highway. The same thing happened again. The AT light also came on once while driving slowly in 1st gear. (You can see it go on and off in the video.)

It honestly feels like something is just triggering the AT light for no reason, because the transmission drives perfectly fine otherwise. It only happens when cruising steadily in 5th gear — never while shifting. Could this still be related to the new battery or the short circuit that drained it?

1oaxyfu,Am I screwed?,"Hello everyone,

**TLDR;** My coolant is disappearing very quickly and my oil level is high. How nervous should I be?

Two weeks ago, I bought my first car (used 2009 Subaru Impreza standard, 83k miles). It drives like a dream, but within a few days I noticed the cold engine light would stay on for a few minutes after starting every morning. Not a big deal, I thought, its autumn in New England so the mornings are starting to get pretty chilly, and it always comes off after a minute or two.  

  
Two days ago, my girlfriend and I go on a \~100 mile road trip to her hometown. I am napping in the car while she's driving when she notices that the hot engine light is blinking. We get to her parents' house, I poke around, notice that the coolant is completely empty, nada, zilch. I top it off. Great. While I'm poking around, I also notice that the engine oil is looking a bit high. The color and texture is perfect, mind you, but the level is a good inch above the full line on the dipstick. I show this to my GF's dad (a car guy, which I am not), and he agrees that its high and we decide to let it drain out a bit, but we end up letting the whole thing drain and replace it with fresh oil: just over 4 quarts of 5w30 as specified by my manual. It exactly hits the full line on the dipstick. Great. We drive the 100 miles back last night. Lights stay off. Car is driving like a dream. Great. 

When we arrive back, I check the engine just to make sure everything is in order and... the coolant is completely empty, nada, zilch, and the oil is about an inch over the full line (still perfect color). 

I'm taking it in to the mechanic tomorrow morning, but since its sunday I have to just sit on my hands and ponder it. So please aid me in whetting my anxiety: am I fucked? Is this the sure sign of a coming gasket problem? Do I just have a leaky tube somewhere? Help me fret my day away.

BUT of course it's a totally different field with so much more complexity. And it also requires one to have acces to a different kind of workshop.

The few exceptions are rare/antique engine designs or racing applications.

I just sold my BMW X5M, and now I’m left with only a 10-year-old Honda Fit. It’s reliable, inexpensive to maintain, and gets the job done.

when i brake, my cars make a grinding sound that sounds like something is dragging under the car (which is a sound i know very well). however, nothing is dragging under the car. the sound will sometimes persist as i drive off too.

1ob20yy,Oil leak engine failure,"
Hi everyone, looking for some advice from mechanics or legal experts.

I have a 2024 Honda HR-V serviced only at my local Honda dealership. They did the last oil change in May 2025. Since then, I barely drove — short local trips in town and to and from work (also local) No oil leaks, smells, or stains ever noticed.

Mon Oct 6: Low oil pressure light flickered on/off while driving. I called the dealership — they said “Drive it home and bring it in tomorrow out earliest appt is at 3 pm” So I follow their instruction and make the appt to bring in next day. 
Tues Oct 7: Next morning, I take my son to his daycare which is less than 10 km away as they never told me not to drive the car, simply to bring it in later on this day. Same warning came up again and flickered on and off as well as other warning that I couldn’t read it was flickering so much. The car started rattling loudly (like a transport truck), and within 1 minute it completely shut down in the middle of the road. I called a tow truck and he said he smelled oil and could see a large puddle of oil on the road after he got it on the tow truck. I didn’t see it smell oil prior to this. 
Dealership call and tells me they are “scratching their heads” as they’ve never seen this before but they say the engine is seized and the oil drain plug was found sitting on top of the engine.
They now claim warranty won’t cover it because it’s “not a factory defect.” They tell me it’s $6500 to replace with a 2 year old engine (from a car that was involved in a fender bender 😐) essentially implying it’s my responsibility to pay for. This is a 2 year old car that has been driven safely and had all maintenance and repairs done at their dealership! They don’t even know what caused this to happen so how can I be expected to pay for this? My car has been there for over 12 days now and they haven’t called me in over a week with any kind of update and I’m kind of getting pissed off at this point. 

Could the drain plug have been improperly tightened during the oil change, and then gradually loosened over time, finally coming off after I drove over some rough construction roads last week?
Is this mechanically possible, and how can I prove it was the dealership’s fault?
I followed their instructions, didn’t ignore the warning, and drove only short local trips.

I’ve requested to have everything on my file emailed to me as I want to have physical proof of everything they’ve done and I’ve emailed consumer relations to inquire with them. What else can I do ? I can’t afford lawyer

A car's revs going up and down on their own, especially when  stopped, is referred to as ""hunting for idle"" and likely means something is off with either the intake system or the fuel system. If the car wasn't getting enough air, the engine might be flooded with fuel, which can be fixed. If it wasn't getting enough fuel, then it could have been running so lean that the engine got hot enough to start melting, and may not be salvageable.

I couldn't turn the car on or off either. 

Why I think I broke it: I had begun cleaning it later on in the day, so the sun went down pretty quickly and I needed some light. So I turned on the car to have the little lights on, and I kept the doors open to let air through to help dry out where I wiped it down.

1oavti4,Engine making clicking noise when accelerating after receiving oil change - please help!,"My 2007 Toyota Corolla engine is making a clicking/ticking noise when I accelerate and press down on the gas pedal after receiving an oil change. The oil change was done by a mechanic I have used for years and he has a reputation for being super honest and reliable. The clicking noise seems to go away after driving for about 15+ miles. I brought it back into the mechanic who did the oil change and he checked things out said he couldn’t find anything. (However, I brought it in after I had driven 20 miles so it wasn’t making the clicking noise, I’m going to try to bring it back while it is actively making the noise, just harder to time it that way.) 

To summarize:
-engine is making a clicking noise when accelerating after receiving an oil change 

-oil change was done by a reputable mechanic and not a jiffy lube type place

-the car was absolutely not making this sound prior to the oil change

-Although it’s an old car, I have always kept up with timely oil changes and maintenance and the car is in great condition 

-noise seems to go away after driving for 15+ miles

Any wisdom or advice is appreciated greatly! I trust my mechanic, but I can help but be worried something was missed and that I’m damaging my car by continuing to drive it.

Turn the key and would get a slow crank and then nothing. 
First thought battery. Load tested battery, no issues. Has voltage and has almost 700cca. Tried to jump it anyways with no change at all. Finally got a tow up the road into a parking lot 5hrs later. (A whole nother fiasco).

Come back the next day to work and diagnose in daylight. 
Battery still good. All fuses checked good. Checked that stupid fuse on battery terminal as well.
Next thought is maybe issue with starter. Maybe a failing solenoid or relay. Swapped relays, no change.
Had to remove intake manifold to remove starter. Performed bench test. It spins but bendix does not emgage and push out pinion. Get a new one for $200. And install. No change at all. 

Oil level was good. Oil dark and was just changed a week prior. Remove coils and plugs to see if a cylinder may have hydro lock. No issue there. Engine does turn but very slowly. Nothing but air in cylinders. 
Remove valve cover to look at timing chain. Do not see any issues there.
Tried to turn crankshaft thru wheel well access but did not have my 12"" breaker.

1oatc7g,Please help — I need advice from experienced mechanics about a Subaru internship I am very lost.,"Hey everyone,

I just got an offer to do my internship at a Subaru dealership, and I could really use some advice from experienced mechanics before I decide.

I’m still in auto school. The thing is, Subaru mainly uses boxer engines, and I’m a bit worried that if I spend all my training time on those, it might not help me much when I need to work on inline or V engines later in my career.

Do you think starting at Subaru is a good choice for someone who’s just beginning their professional mechanic journey?  
Will the skills and experience still transfer well if I move to another brand later?

Will I understanding inline or V engines ?

Any advice or personal experience would really help me out. Thanks in advance!

I stopped and removed the glove box (spilled a box ammo, explains the stray 9mm round), and looked to see any leaks or condensation but couldn’t find any. Continuing to our destination, I began to take note that the sound persisted ONLY when making left turns, and eventually a clear liquid began to drain into the passenger floorboard from between the glovebox and the center console. 

This made me think it could likely be a damaged heater core, seeing as though the two lines on the cabin side of the fire wall are exactly where the leak is coming from. The only odd thing is the heat still functions and does so without leaving film or condensation on the glass, and the liquid is floor is more consistent with water than anti freeze based coolant (no odor). The engine is not running hot as of yet. 

This morning I came out to add more coolant and check the problem, to which when I started the vehicle, I heard the sound of liquid sloshing behind the dashboard for around 15-20 seconds.

I took out the bolt, and opened the caliper clamshell style (the top bolt is still in, bottom bolt is removed, so you can open it up like a clamshell). When I put the caliper back down two things happened:

1. It was really hard to press the caliper down, and after some force, it knocked the shim loose. So I put the shim back in place, and closed the caliper on top of it, but am worried if that's an issue.

2. The bigger issue; when I was tightening the 14MM bolt back into the caliper, I overtightened and the bolt snapped off. So now there is a portion (roughly half) of the bolt is stuck inside the slide pin, and the caliper is not fully bolted on the bracket. Like the top half is still bolted on, but the bottom half isn't.

Next time I was at the mechanic, I asked him if that's really how that hose goes in (because it does seem like a driving over a pothole would jolt that thing loose) but he said that it just slides in there like that.

While I was driving, my battery accidentally arced. The car shut off and then came back on. Since then, I have no power steering and a warning on the dash that says “Steering wheel malfunction — stop car.”

What I’ve already checked/done:
	•	All fuses and relays are good
	•	Codes showing: $7E8 and $7E9
	•	Tried clearing codes with a reader — would not erase
	•	Disconnected negative battery terminal for 30 minutes — no change
	•	Tried steering reset (turn full right and hold, full left and hold, then center) — still showing malfunction

Has anyone dealt with this before or know what likely needs to be done next? Looking for any insight before I start buying parts or towing it to a shop.

1oazbfv,Wheel Bearing - WTF,"TL:DR I think several spare bearings I've bought are out of spec (too much axial clearance).

So I'm making this post because I'm at the point where I feel like I'm loosing my mind.

Quick background: Working on my own car ('03 E46 320d). Used to be a mech, MEng degree, now in design. Not to sound important, but to say I've done this many times and \_should\_ know what I'm doing. Or so I thought…

To keep this as short as possible, this is what happened:

\> Rear left wheel bearing makes growling noise, time for a replacement.

\> Got a new bearing, replaced the bearing, nothing untoward during the work.

\> Car back on the road - immediately knocking noise from the rear axle. Wasn't there before.

\> Back up on the ramp, wheel is wobbly, approx. 1 mm movement at the wheel diameter.

\> Check all bushes, axle is rock solid. Clearly visible relative movement between upright and wheel / driveshaft / hub assembly. 

\> Assume that I’ve messed up the job somehow (maybe damaged it when pressing it in)

\> Order a new bearing (different supplier), do the work again. 

\> Do the work extra pernickety, checking over everything twice, all clean, all good.

\> Car back on the road - knocking again. Panic sets in.. 

\> Back up the ramp, exact same again: Anything on the axle is tight as it should be.

\> Used a dial indicator mounted to the upright, can’t remember the value but clearly relative movement between the upright and the wheel / hub / driveshaft assembly

\> Already starting to loose my mind little bit at this point.. what have I done wrong? 

\> Everything apart again. Inspect every little detail of the assembly. Everything looks and feels absolutely as it should. 

\> Last resort: Check the bearing. It’s the double angular contact type with one outer and a split inner race. Clamping the inner races together in the vice with a washer… and the outer race has lots of free play! Measured it again, approx. 0,1 mm axial play. This is 100% what’s causing the free play. Extrapolating the 0,1 mm on the bearing onto the wheel diameter gives me the approx. 1 mm wobble at the wheel. 

\> So I think, fair enough, maybe I damaged the first one, the second one is bad (was cheap). 

\> Order another bearing (third one). Go for premium, FAG/Schaeffler.

\> Get the bearing, first thing I do is measure. And that’s where I’m loosing my mind now. The new bearing has 0,16 mm free play! 

\> I clamped the bearing with the bearing puller tool, to simulate installation on the driveshaft. Do it up to 200 Nm - the free play reduces to 0,15 mm. 

So here are my thoughts now:

The probability for three bearings, from three different suppliers (one of them being a nice Schaeffler one), with the same excess clearance has to be zero. 

However:

0,16 mm axial free play *feels* way to high. I checked the Schaeffler catalogue, and that exact PN doesn’t have the full spec published. But the bearings of the same type and size are spec’d with 0,058 mm axial clearance in the coarsest grade. This (or somewhere around 0,03 mm) seems much more realistic to me. I’ve sent an email to Schaeffler to confirm, doubt I’d be getting anything back. 

My plan is now to order another few bearings from different suppliers and measure. Maybe I’ve just been exceptionally unlucky. But I find that hard to believe.



So my questions are:

Have I missed anything here?

Is 0,16 mm free play normal for this type of bearing (I don’t think so but happy to be corrected)?

If you have access to wheel bearings of the same type, what should the axial clearance be?

Have you had experience with out of spec bearings recently, or generally?

Am I just a colossal moron and have messed something up here that I’m unable to see?

1oawmlr,what is an acceptable amount of pitting on rotors? if theres plenty of actual brake left can pitted rotors wait to be replaced until the pads need done too?,"Pics 1, 2, & 3 are the front drivers and passenger brake rotors on a 2014 Toyota Camry. Pics 4 & 5 are the perfectly immaculate rear rotors on the same car for comparison.
No known issues with the vehicle but date the brakes were last done is unknown.

As far as I can tell (by wedging my finger in there and feeling it, so not exactly very scientific—I have not removed the wheels to actually get all up in there and look for real), theres a fair amount of pad left on both the front brakes.

With pitting like this, do the rotors need replaced? If so, can it wait awhile until the pads need replaced? I am not a mechanic but I would be doing the repairs myself and I really hate working on brakes; I’d love to wait and replace the pads and rotors in one fell swoop in the spring as the pads will probably need done by then. 

How bad does pitting need to be before it starts to become unsafe? Are these ones probably ok to make it through the winter or should I suck it up and replace them now? 

Also, what caused this? This vehicle has never seen snow or salt or any kind of abuse/neglect in its life and does not have one speck of rust on it—i bought it for that reason (i prefer to buy vehicles privately with cash but I live in Maine, so doing that up here is like playing Russian roulette with rust damage, so I flew to North Carolina to buy this car and drove it back up to Maine)

1oaweqk,"1987 Ford Ranger XLT 2.9L 5 Speed, no guts going up any incline.","Alright so bare with me. I don't post on reddit often nor do I have a whole lot of knowledge on Ford in general as this is a project for my Girlfriend. I just recently bought a 87' Ford Ranger XLT Supercab with the 2.9L V6 and 6 speed transmission. We got it cheap from an older man knowing it had some issues with having no real power going up inclines. It'll put put around on a flat surface but struggle to climb the small incline of my drive way to get into the garage. 

So to lay out the issue I'm confused with is that the fuel pumps will constantly run from the moment the key is turned on. My fuel pressure gauge read up to around 36-38PSI from the valve near the injectors. It starts up just fine, revs to redline with no lag whatsoever. As stated before will move on its own power on a flat surface but has no real guts to climb anything. Now here, to where one of the things that the elderly gentleman I bought the Ranger from ended relocating the in line high pressure fuel pump to inside the engine bay on the driver side inner fender well to make it easier on himself. From what I can see he ran softline from the tank up to the inner fender well. I see no leaks at all from ANY fuel line. The in tank fuel pump looked fine and I can hear it whine (same thing persists acting like its on 24/7 and or not building pressure) I even added a new line between the pump and fuel pump housing itself to see if that could be a part of the issue. (Had an S10 where that hose was the issue.) 

Alongside when tracing the wiring it seems to go into the wiring harness on the driver side inner fender well (Pictures attached) And that just doesn't seem right. Alongside that on the passenger side of the engine bay I only see 2 relays and I believe there is supposed to be either 3 or 4 there. (Looked at some junkyard Bronco IIs and 1st generation Rangers) Alongside with either of the 2 existing relays there unplugging either of them does not change the fact that both pumps still receive power.

Now I know I've bought a mess of a truck but it was hard to pass up a $300 Ranger in decent shape for my girlfriend who's first vehicle was a rebuilt 87' Ranger XLT Supercab 2.9L with a 5 speed. So I'm here asking for suggestion from everyone here so that I can learn and figure out the issue. I can take more pictures if asked (timing depends on day and time of day.) As well as I'm a younger guy who's still learning and does not mind doing the work at all. Please ask questions and I will do my best to answer them.

If im not mistaken absorption mufflers are good at reducing higher frequency noises and reflection are good at lower frequencies (or the other way around, but i think this is the correct way). My oldtimer had at one point three somewhat large absorption mufflers and still couldn't pass noise tests since the lower frequencies passed through more or less untouched, so you ideally have both types in your system.

There are also mufflers that combine both types in one.

As far as absorption mufflers go larger means quieter. Reflection are more engine type dependant, they should be suitable for the engine configuration."

Taller/newer pickups usually have the former happen, even without a grill guard.

All my used cars are serviced, undersealed, new tyres, brakes and fresh MOT. Recently I sold a used car about 3 weeks ago. Gave 3 months warranty with a third party warranty company and he also extended with them directly for another 12 months. Since then, every week or every few days, the customer has been messaging me with issues.

In the first week, it was the rear parking sensors not working, exhaust had a blow, cigarette port not working and windscreen washer leaking. These were there at the time of sale so I agreed to get these sorted myself under my own internal warranty. Changed the whole exhaust, cigarette port was a fuse, windscreen washer was an elbow pipe and the rear sensors needed replacing as one was faulty.

The second week in, he messages saying the drivers door doesn’t unlock first time with the remote unless you press it 3-5 times or use the manual key to unlock. This was a new fault and not present at the time but I agreed to replace the door lock actuator under my internal warranty.

I’ve ordered it and he is due to bring it to me in 2 weeks. Now the third week in, he messages saying there is a timing chain rattle on start up for 1-2 seconds then it goes away. I’ve looked up on forums for these engines, it says it could be the oil check valve which could be faulty and not holding enough oil at the top of the engine to feed to the timing chain when you start the engine on cold. I’ve offered to change something called an oil check valve which a lot of people say will fix this chain rattle. Some say changing just the chain tensioner will also fix it. Only issue with changing this entire timing chain is the engine has to come out as the chain is at the rear of the engine.

He wanted to claim directly with the third party warranty company to not put me out of pocket, but as the car is quite old, although it mentions ‘camshaft timing belt and tensioner (must be serviced to manufacturers recommendations)’, I don’t think they will approve the repair. I wouldn’t do it under my own internal warranty as this issue wasn’t there at the time of sale. However it’s still in the 3 mont warranty that we have to give for the Consumer Rights Act? So really unsure what to do on this one.

The vehicle only has one service stamp by me on the last service as the previous owner lost the service book. His mileage is 75k and the recommended interval for the timing chain replacement is 80k. He says he doesn’t have the money to replace it and is concerned about the issue getting worse and asked for my thoughts.

I’m stuck and unsure what to do. Hearing complaints about issues every week and now this, I don’t know what to do?

I can tell him to claim with the warranty company for just the tensioner? They may pay out for that? If he claims for the whole chain and tensioner, I have a feeling 90% they’ll reject the claim as the timing hasn’t been changed according to manufacturers recommendations?

Other option is I can change this oil check valve like I suggested yesterday which is under the PCV meaning the supercharger has to come off being a 3.0 TFSI engine and 80% chance it’ll eliminate the chain rattle on start up? It’s a lot of labour involved but if it has to be done then I guess it has to? Other alternative is to change the chain tensioner but I’d probably have to send it to my friend’s garage since I don’t have a ramp for that. But I’ve really had enough headache with this customer and hope and want this to be the last claim and complaint with issues.

Well, looks like my 2014 Hyundai Elantra finally gave out at 125k miles. The transmission won’t move forward at all anymore — only reverse works.

I spent the whole day today with my dad draining out the transmission fluid, cleaning everything out, checking for leaks, and adding new fluid again (about 4 quarts). Still nothing. What’s crazy is that last week, we added fluid and the car started driving perfectly again — but this time it won’t move forward at all.

Now I keep wondering if this whole thing could’ve been avoided. I was consistent with all my maintenance: oil changes every 3k miles, new spark plugs, brakes, and even added fuel system cleaner each oil change. The only thing I *didn’t* do was change my transmission fluid around 100k miles. My mechanic back then told me it “wasn’t necessary.”

So now I’m wondering — did skipping that transmission service cause this? Or was this bound to happen eventually with these Hyundais around this mileage?

1oac98d,2014 Nissan Sentra - Not sure if my problem is solved by better habits or new parts,"Hi all! Sorry in advance, I know nothing about cars.

My 2014 Nissan Sentra SL (automatic) is sitting at like 150k ish. Only major repair it's had was a new transmission in like 2020. Air conditioner went out a few years ago but I'm told that's also unfortunately normal. No check engine lights or anything.

I work from home and have 2 cars so in the summer, the Nissan tends to sit a bit thanks to being AC-less.

I went to start it one day and the battery was dead. I figured, ok, it's been sitting, no biggie. I drove it to the auto parts store and left it running in the parking lot, bought a battery, had them replace it right there. Easy. (worth noting i left the car running for a while without the key gob in it and it didn't turn itself off)

Then about 2 weeks later or so (driving it maybe once in this time frame), I went out to start it and it wouldn't start again. Took it for a diagnosis and the mechanic said either it was a parasitic power issue or a faulty battery. Ran a test and said nevermind on the parasitic draw, and it's definitely a faulty battery. He said the starter and alternator both tested good.

Replaced that battery and it ran fine for a good month and I even took it on a short road trip, then I parked it for about 2 months (my b-- i maybe drove it like on a few 2 mile treks in this time but it mostly sat) and it wouldn't start. I jumped it and it ran long enough to idle in my driveway for like 30 minutes, but then when I got to the nearest gas station, I jumped out (leaving it running) to check the tire pressure and when I walked away with my fob, it shut itself off. I chalked this up to leaving with the key, but google tells me that's actually not a feature of this car and it definitely didn't do that when I first replaced the battery? Either way, when I got back into the car, it wouldn't start. I carry a jumper box but it wouldn't jump. AAA came out and couldn't get it to jump start either so towed me home.

Called a mobile mechanic and he agreed that the battery was now dead beyond repair BUT that the alternator seemed to be working fine. I asked if parking it for that long was the cause and he said a brand new battery shouldn't die that fast. His theory is that the alternator is going bad but intermittently? Or maybe just the voltage regulator inside it? So it's working whenever people test it, but not working when it acts up. But he's stressing that this is only intuition and he really can't promise everything will be fixed after the alternator is replaced. He was able to jump it using my same jumper box that failed me a few days before.

So today I jumped it in my driveway and it worked again, thankfully. I limped it to the auto parts place and had them swap my battery. The car did turn itself off again in the parking lot while I was inside getting the battery, but it fired up with the new battery and drove home okay.

I have a mechanic family member who said maybe it's something to do with the ignition switch but agrees it could also be the alternator, and a car-loving friend who thinks what's actually happening is mice have chewed up a cable somewhere that's bouncing around and getting and losing connection.

Fast/quick, yeah sure but having the car doing all the work and there be no differences every single time just sounds boring very quickly since I can't mess up a shift or a launch.

Charging also sounds like a headache for example if I do a long trip say 5 hours to somewhere stay/explore the area then head home i dont really stop at any service stations anyways in ICE cars as i like to get the drive done so a ev would just add time to my journey.

1oaus7e,I have added a MOT History feature to the car tax results on The Car Tax Calculator (FREE TOOL),"Hey everyone, afternoon,



It's been a while. Firstly, thanks to everyone still using [The Car Tax Calculator (TCTC)](https://thecartaxcalculator.co.uk/), sharing it with their peers and sending me feedback/ ideas.



One piece of feedback I kept hearing, especially from people posting for advice here and on similar subs, was that the tax result was only half the story. Often, after you get the tax cost, you'd have to jump to the government site or another site to check the MOT history before you can truly decide if the car is worth it.



It makes sense. So, I spent the last couple of weeks integrating the **full MOT History** directly into the car tax results page.



For a live example of one of my old cars (I miss you, Selina), check out this result - [https://tctc.sbs/results/muwhzwvAge7MmFu3RwnFN](https://tctc.sbs/results/muwhzwvAge7MmFu3RwnFN)



I aimed to keep the user interface minimal while providing an easy-to-navigate flow on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Ultimately, I hope the new results page, which combines both the tax ownership information and vehicle health checks, helps users make confident decisions.



More information on the benefits of this new feature can be found here [https://tctc.sbs/whats-new/changelog-mot-history-at-a-glance-know-the-full-story](https://tctc.sbs/whats-new/changelog-mot-history-at-a-glance-know-the-full-story)



Give it a try next time you're looking for a car or checking for road tax. Also, please continue to share it with anyone who might find it useful and let me know what you think.

Cheers, Leon ",2,1760893104.0,2,CartalkUK,1760988880,2025-10-19 16:58:24,2025-10-20 19:34:40,DeanyyBoyy93 (Score: 2): This looks a great tool thanks for sharing :)

Didn't know what it was at all. Asked if it was for sale and they said not sure it was their sons and hasn't been used for years.

I said a grand (£1000). And he said yeah sure. I think in the end I actually even paid £900 for it.

Took it home. It ran great and was completely original in good condition. It was a Honda VFR400RR NC30 which were quite rare.

A few months down the line I wanted to just clean it up a bit further so spoke to a Honda Parts dealer who told me that upon looking at the frame number, it turned out to be an ultra rare full UK Spec bike. Not an import like almost every other one out there. This bike was built to UK Spec from the factory, sold and first registered in the UK. I haven't been able to find out how many of these were produced but it is reportedly only a fraction of the amount imported.

The bike started to pick up interest and ballooned in value. After 2 years or so of owning it, I sadly dropped it in the snow and ice. Didn't do a huge amount of damage.

verone3784 (Score: 7): A cheap OBD scanner will clear a CEL, but it'll just come back again. 

As others have said, if someone's wanting to charge you £250 for clearing the light, then they're probably software coding the lambda sensor out from the cat too so that it doesn't bring the CEL back on.

If they're charging that much, you should be enquiring as to what exactly they're going to do.

There's also the oldschool way to get rid of a CEL if you remove your cat too - on older cars before everything was digital, a decat would usually be accompained by a spoof plug that you put in place of the lambda sensor. 

This would basically short the harness out with the right resistance for a lambda sensor that was giving a reading within normal operating range, and fool the car's ECU into thinking the cat was still there and was all good.

There's a lot of ways to do decat skulduggery, you just need to work out what's best for your particular car and make sure that it's reversible, come MOT time :)

My car is a 3L BMW 440i gran coupe (326bhp) and they’ve provided me with a 2L Mercedes E200 E Class (201bhp) . Size wise, it’s similar, but that’s where the similarities end.

1oalxt8,Helping identify the issue,"**Car:** 2010 Toyota Aygo

**Problem Summary:** After a series of brake-related services, I'm experiencing intermittent issues with the brake pedal: it sometimes sinks further on its own with grinding noises, and occasionally ""springs back"" audibly when released. Two different mechanics have been unable to diagnose it.

**Detailed Symptoms:**

1. **Intermittent Brake Pedal Sink:** While braking (not every time), the pedal will travel down further than normal on its own. It doesn't feel soft all the time, just occasionally ""gives way"" a bit.
2. **Grinding/Scraping Noise:** This pedal sink is accompanied by a distinct grinding or metal-on-metal scraping sound. (doesn't happen all the time and has happened less since getting new discs and pads)
3. **Brake Pedal ""Spring Back"":** When taking my foot off the brake, there is occasionally a loud, audible springing or clunking sound, as if something is catching and then releasing.

**History/Timeline of Work:**

1. The problem began immediately after getting all four tires replaced. During that service, the tire shop pressured my partner into also replacing the brake pads (discs were not changed at this time).
2. **My Attempted Fix:** A month or so later, thinking the issue was with the cheap pads or worn discs, I replaced **both the brake discs and pads** on both axles with new, quality parts. The problem **persisted unchanged**.
3. The car has been to two separate garages since the new discs/pads were installed. Both have inspected the work and say they ""can't find anything wrong.""

I'm at my wits' end. Has anyone seen this before? It feels like something wasn't reassembled correctly during the initial tyre/pad job, but two mechanics can't spot it.

I immediately did so, it was a little below the minimum line, and so I topped it off with Prestone coolant from the garage.

Last week, got an array of fault warnings on the dash, multiple systems need attention but then after witch off/on they were gone.  I believe this is some computer error, as no way did four or five different things all fail at once. (One of which was parking brake, which clearly works fine.)

Yesterday, I again got the coolant level fault and upon checking, it was not low, but it did have a browny, slightly milky appearance. I know there are multiple possible causes here - the oil filler cap has zero milkiness, I don't believe this is a head gasket, but whatever - I was going to take it into the workshop because it's under an extended warranty anyway.

But then my research led me to discover that apparently, mixing coolants can cause this and therefore, me adding the Prestone may be the culprit.  (Which would make it not covered by warranty, if I took it in and that's what they found.)

However, I read up some more and found that Prestone says:

*""Prestone’s Coolant/Antifreeze is guaranteed to be compatible with all cars, vans or light trucks. Thanks to its unique and patented formula, Prestone Coolant/Antifreeze remains the only coolant on the market that can be mixed with another product within the cooling system without causing damage. That means there’s no need to flush your car’s cooling system before adding Prestone Coolant/Antifreeze; simply pour the product into your coolant reservoir – it’s that simple.*""

I owned a 7.5 and it was a lovely place to be, I just don't feel the same way about the new cars, especially given the increase in prices.

1oabwog,Who’s responsible for accidents after water run off by washing your car?,"Hi,

In the case I’m washing my car at home, some of the water will go over the pedestrian zone and also on the road, it’s going to be soapy water.
It’s bio soap so that’s ok for pollution, but who’s gonna be responsible if any accident???

I’ve done some search online, it’s legal to do so but no one was wondering what happens in case of accidents…

I have a water runaway but it’s on the garage side, some of it may go there but some will also go towards the road, I have no runaway there, as everyone else…",0,1760833558.0,25,CartalkUK,1760988880,2025-10-19 00:25:58,2025-10-20 19:34:40,"Disastrous-Force (Score: 14): Seriously? What accident do you think will happen?

It’s water it will eventually soak into the ground or evaporate.

There is maybe a genuine question here if you were doing this in mid winter when the run off may freeze.

1oabffa,Is this a good idea? Gonna go view it on Saturday,"Looking for a diesel saloon for commuting to and from my new job (around 60 motorway miles a day). Budget is around £10,000 and was looking at the A6 for a more lux / comfortable option compared to my current 2010 1.6 Vauxhall Astra. 
Any suggestions or help welcome!

Just see so many cars with tacky mods like this abused/driven like bellends.

All of the above will be mods to add to insurance too.

Great cars if well looked after, but I don't think that will be on face value.

Plumb121 (Score: 3): I have one and I bought it for the same reason. 60mpg is easy and very comfortable. Make sure the gearbox has been serviced regularly as that's a weak link"
