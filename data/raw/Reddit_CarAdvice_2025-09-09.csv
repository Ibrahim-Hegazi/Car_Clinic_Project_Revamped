1nc3x83,2014 Accord LX Starting Issues,"I have a 2014 Accord EX with \~95,000 miles (2.4L I4). Recently (about a month ago), I installed a new battery after it had intermittent starting issues. It had a no crank, no start condition. It got progressively worse then better after I changed the battery. However, I have still been fighting the issue. I believed it to be the negative connection as it was loose and needed to be replaced even after tightening and cleaning. Yesterday, it got to the point where it wouldn't crank at all but all accessories would come on. I took it to a shop and they replaced it. This worked for a few times, but after driving for a few minutes home my car wouldn't start again. It has the same no crank, no start condition. When I try to turn it over it gives a single click. What is the likely cause of this issue given a new battery, good connections, and decent maintenance?

It could be that your vehicle has a grade assist where it downshifts when you are going down hill, I have a honda odyssey and was surprised to see that it would downshift and stay in a lower gear when going down a mountain.

I believe the correct range is 48-55 PSI according to: [charm.li](https://charm.li/Honda/2009/Element%204WD%20L4-2.4L/Repair%20and%20Diagnosis/Maintenance/Tune-up%20and%20Engine%20Performance%20Checks/Fuel%20Pressure/Specifications/)

When first put KOEO pressure goes to about 46 PSI then sinks to 40, then climbs a bit. It got up to 52 at idle but it appears to be losing pressure and giving different readings. At one point it is reading 46 PSI at idle. Turn the engine off (key on)and it will go down to 48 but then sink down to 38-42 PSI after a few minutes. I'm under the impression the KOEO reading should be the same as idling, is that correct?

Hey everyone, I'm looking for advice on what's going on with this engine.  I don't expect good news.

This was my first car, I've been learning how to maintain things as the years have gone on.  I definitely didn't do so good a job for a while, had to learn the hard way a lot.



The pictures are from an inexpensive borescope I have or my camera, hope they're good enough to get an idea of what's going on here.



Been noticing a sweet smell when the car starts for the first minute or so (no visible smoke/vapor from exhaust).  
When I change my oil (synthetic, every 2500 miles) it been coming out darker than expected the last few times.



When I start the car, it's a little rough with vibration and the idle when warm has more vibration that it did even 1 year back.  During this time, while all accessories are off (fan/heaters/AC/radio and hands off steering wheel), after 30-60 seconds, the RPMs surge back up briefly and drop again.

If I don't start the car for a couple days, especially as it gets colder in the mornings, when it turns over it seems real concussive, like I can feel it in thru the car.  Sounds unusually forceful and bogs for the first 1-4 seconds.

  
Also when driving, if I give decent throttle input when the car is going up a hill at 1500-3500RPM, or moving from a dead start with not quite enough throttle, I hear a metallic slapping/clapping/clacking noise.

The first place I went to told me that my catalytic convertor might need to be replaced, but to go somewhere else to get a second opinion and do repairs because they couldn't do it there.

So I took it in to a different place today, and within 10 minutes of taking my car back, they come and tell me that I need to replace my catalytic converter. They gave me a quote for a replacement that would be 3200 dollars(parts and labor including costs for a new cat, a new oxygen sensor, and labor), because they say I needed one that would fit the emission standards for California. 

In my inspection, they sent me pictures of the code scanner, showing the error code P0420-00, and then another picture of a sticker showing my vehicle emission control information with an arrow pointing to a quote saying ""California: Not for sale in states with California emissions standards."" Am I reading this wrong or does this not mean that I don't need a California grade part? On top of this, I live on the east coast and have never even been remotely close to California.

I declined the repairs, and while driving an hour later, my CEL turned off.

1nc0whr,How to check evap core on 2020 Mercedes gle350,"basically what the title says, got a car in the shop that the previous lead tech had worked on and hes replaced basically everything except the condenser and evap core. the car keeps leaking freon in about 2 weeks after each fill.

I put dye in it and checked the lines and compressor but found no dye. I checked the condenser and found no leaks/holes or dye. I collected the water dripping from the bottom of the car and checked it with the uv light as well and didnt find any dye in it.

I had asked my brother (also a mechanic) what to try and he said to try checking through the blower motor/vents to look for dye but on this car, rhe air filter is on the outside and there's no hole going to the evaporator like in most cars.

 at this point i was suggested to make a hole in the driver side where the condenser goes into and to try and see if there a leak in there. I tried to do this earlier today and damaged a part on the condenser but still didnt see any dye or anything in there. 

im pretty sure it is the evap core at this point due to not seeing any other leaks but would like to have a way to check it and be sure before I just jump into it. i dont know how else I could check it or what else I could do. 

any help is appreciated, thank you",1,1757368006.0,2,MechanicAdvice,1757446414,2025-09-08 21:46:46,2025-09-09 19:33:34,harmabevengeance (Score: 1): Well the good news is that it's definitely leaking now.

First, that radiator hose is definitely leaking, or was leaking at some point. Can't tell if its coming from the rubber hose itself or from the base of the outlet of the actual radiator.

Next the overheating issue, it could very well be possible that the mechanic you took it to didn't burp the coolant system, and a trapped air pocket in the engine is causing it to overheat. I would ask him that before proceeding with anything else. Also the thing about the head gasket. It could also be possible that they got damaged when the car first overheated, the heads themselves could also be damaged too. You can actually test for damaged head gaskets with [this](https://a.co/d/gVdfI2p) kit. Should be able to do this yourself just follow a video. At the end of the day though, if you do plan on replacing an engine it will be cheaper than paying for a car note on a new or used car. As a side note you could also try getting a second opinion from a reputable shop.

Looking for some confirmation in my diagnosis before I go taking my bed off.

Recently hopped in my truck one day and it would crank but not start. Can hear fuel pump prime just fine. I turned the truck to off and then back on and it started right up. Runs and drives fine after you get it running.

I was thinking cam sensor since I just replaced the cam sensor due to the original one leaking some oil, but I have no codes for cam issues, and truck runs great.

I did hook up my pressure gauge to the port on the fuel rail and when I hook it up it says 0psi. Then with key on engine off it primes and gets to about 10-15psi. I prime again and it goes up to about 30psi. Then it starts and idles at about 60psi.

From my reading online it seems there is a check valve in the fuel pump assembly that must have gone bad and is letting the pressure bleed off when truck is off. There is no fuel pressure regulator on the fuel rail either, thats one thing I read but I guess that was only on the earlier models and not my 04.

Just asking to see if there are any other possible issues I should be checking before I put a fuel pump assembly in? Any other way to verify this is the actual issue?

1nbxvj5,Stuck Bearing Race,"Hello. I am trying to remove my swing arm bearings from the rear end of my ATV.

I was using a Slide Hammer bearing puller. This caused the inner bearing race and balls to break, now I’m left with just the outer races stuck in the swing arm.

I have tried to cut the races with a 24 TPI  metal saw blade, that has done nothing. I have used cold chisels to try and crack the races. This also didn’t work. It actually hurt the chisels. 😅

I have heard about welding a bead to shrink the races but I do not own a welder. 

The only thing I can think of is it get a mapgas torch and expand the outer swing arm, to expand the housing. Then I would turn a compressed can of air upside down to spray the bearings with freezing air to try and shrink the bearing. 

In doing this tho, I don’t know how I could beat the bearing out even, as there is limited space from the other side, so the most I can get in there to beat is a small jack handle. The slide hammer will not grip just the outer race.

1nbxc2q,Significant alignment change in 150 miles?,"I got the alignment done on my 2021 BMW 330e xdrive (50k miles) on 7/31. I was in for a rebalancing, the shop checked the alignment for free and asked me to approve them redoing it as well, which I did. Over the next couple days I drove about 140 miles, mixed city/highway, and noticed that the steering wheel was about 1 inch left of center (i.e. when centered, car drove slightlyyyy right)

I then left town for a month. During this time my sister borrowed the car and drove about 10 miles around town

I got back and took it in today to ask them to center the steering wheel. I *thought* that would be all that was required, but in the process, they checked the alignment again and found that it had changed significantly since last time (particularly front wheel toe). They re-did it at no charge, and the wheel is now either just barely left of center, or I'm paranoid - I can't tell

*The tech also noted that the rear camber and toe are now maxed out, and that I have a worn bushing on the left rear, which could be causing misalignment*

My questions are:

1. Is such a swing in alignment numbers over one month / 150 miles expected? I haven't hit any potholes. Should I suspect either my sister or the shop of mistreatment? (She's a good driver and has borrowed my car many times - I haven't used this shop before)

2. Is there anything about my alignment or the bushing that I need to get addressed right now? All the shop said when I asked was ""give it a test drive, if you have any issues bring it back""

3. If the answer to #2 is ""yes"", is it alright to drive ~300 miles on the interstate to my mechanic of choice (home town), or do I need to seek out someone local?

When I called the dealership they told me to check coolant and continue driving & I was very adamant I was not going to drive the car at all in this condition, which is why they offered me the towing companies number and to cover the tow! I knew enough to know not to keep driving it even if they said too in case it caused more damage and they wanted to sway blame from them to me. 

A few weeks ago my car 2016 Chevy equinox was running rough & reducing engine power. I have a warranty, so I called the Chevy dealership. I ended up paying about 2000$ out of pocket for an engine replacement, which isn’t bad. My car was ready for pickup Thursday. Friday, I drove it to work & all was fine. Friday evening my check engine light turned on. We called the dealership and they said bring it back Monday since they were closing for the weekend. Well it’s Monday.

I called the dealership & they have me call a tow company (they say they are covering it thank god!) . It’s a 90 minute wait. Which cool. I have my kid in the car, it’s hot, but whatever.

The touch-to-lock/unlock function on the driver's side door handle is not working.

​Here's what I've done so far:

- ​I've already replaced the door handle sensor with a sensor form my rear left door but it also did not work. For clarity, I swapped the sensors of the front left door (driver) and the rear left door. Both sensors work fine in the left rear door but nothing works in the front left door.

- ​I've scanned the car with a cheap OBD2 scanner, and there are no fault codes at all.

- I checked the cables as far as I could but no damage found

- I've disconnected my battery for about 1 hour wich did not give any results

​The key fob works perfectly for remote lock/unlock, and the other doors function as they should. I tried my secondary key fob but unfortunately that did not change anything.

​Since a different sensor didn't fix the problem and there are no codes, i'm stuck for now with ideas... has anyone encountered this before on an S5 or similar B9/B9.5 platform? What's the most likely wire or connection to fail? Or is this a software problem.

Side note: I think this issue may have started after I repeatedly disconnected and reconnected the car's battery over a few hours while working on another part of the car. I'm not 100% sure, but it seems to coincide with when the problem began.

On the Z24i the injector sits above the throttle plate; if it dribbles after shut-down, raw fuel washes the cylinders and ends up in the sump. Pull the air cleaner after a hot soak and check for wetness around the throat, or pressurize the rail and watch for dripping. Also inspect the fuel-pressure regulator diaphragm-it’s known to split and dump fuel straight into the manifold. While you’re there, confirm base fuel pressure and that the coolant temp sensor is in spec; a bad CTS keeps it pig-rich. Change the oil now and again once you’ve cured the leak, then run a compression or leak-down test if it still smells. Bottom line: solve the fueling problem before blaming the rings.

I pulled out the cabin air filter and found a dead mouse and the nest it was building. I took out the blower motor to clean it out and another mouse fell out of that compartment. After cleaning the area and replacing the filter, I let it sit for a few days, but the smell didn’t get much better.

I took it to a shop and they recommended that I replace the heater box, recharge the AC, and get an HVAC refresher kit. I know the heater box is pretty deep in the car and requires several hours of labor to get to, so I was curious how they knew mice were in there specifically. The technician told me that this is the case 9/10 times. The quote for parts and labor was $3500, which is obviously not ideal.

I shopped around a bit, and another local shop told me they could probably do it for cheaper, but they thought a deodorizer might do the trick. The inspected the car a bit, didn’t see any more signs of mice, so they recommended I just go with a deodorizer. The deodorizer helped, but the smell is not entirely gone after a week. This second shop said they could do the whole replacement, recharge, and refresher for $2900.

This is a pretty major expense that I was not expecting, and given that neither shop confirmed that the heater box was the issue, I’m afraid to drop $3k for a potential fix. The car is completely drivable and mechanically fine, but the smell isn’t ideal and probably a bit of a biohazard. I’d like to hear if anybody has faced similar issues, what other areas should be checked before the heater box, and if these prices seem to be what you’d expect.

Pull the blower again, mist the evaporator and ducts with an enzyme-based cleaner (something marketed for HVAC mold), swap the cabin filter once more, then run the fan on high with the heater at full blast for fifteen minutes to bake the moisture out. Follow that with an ozone treatment or a can of Meguiar’s Whole Car Air Re-Fresher left recirculating overnight. While you’re at it, vacuum the cowl intake area and cover the opening with metal screen so new mice can’t get in.

Car: 2015 Chrysler 200C AWD, V6, 9-speed auto, ~100k miles

The issue:
	•	Grinding/hollow noise that starts at 10–15 mph, continues until about 55 mph, then goes away.
	•	In Sport mode, the grinding is constant at all speeds.
	•	Seems to come from the front passenger side/footwell area.
	•	No warning lights, no codes, and the car shifts fine (only slightly harsh 1st–3rd sometimes).
	•	No extra noise when turning.

Jack that corner, spin the wheel by hand, and listen with a stethoscope or long screwdriver on the knuckle; a rough or growling feel points to the bearing. While up there, grab the axle and try to wiggle it-any play at the inner tripod joint or PTU flange means the PTU bearing is shot. Sport mode loads the PTU harder, so a bad bearing in it will whine all the time, matching what you’re hearing. If both feel tight, check the carrier bearing on the driveshaft before you throw parts at it. Rule those three out before chasing anything else-the fix is way cheaper than another diff swap."

To get it to start, you have to turn the key to accessory a couple of times before you try to start it. If the car has been running recently, it starts just fine. 

I took it to the mechanic who replaced the starter last year to get him to check it, because it makes a noise when it fails to start like it does when the starter is dying and it's still under warranty. He said that the starter is fine. He got it to start and after he started it, he said that he tightened the battery cables and then it was starting fine. I'm pretty sure that it only started fine because it was running before he turned it off to tighten the cables. 

He had me come and pick it back up and told me to drive it for a couple of days and see how it does. It is doing the exact same thing as before I took it over there.

I checked the relays and the fuses and all seem to check out fine. Battery, alternator, starter are all ok as far as we can tell. 

When it is running, it runs fine. It doesn't idle rough, lose power, decelerate, any of that stuff. There are no indicator lights on. It seems to be totally normal except for not starting.

* Based on my driving habits, I probably won’t hit 60k until around January 2026.
* As this is my first car and my parents never learned how to drive, and I’m still in college and trying to keep costs low — I can replace the engine and cabin air filters myself, but I don’t want to risk messing up an oil change.
* Dealer estimate \~$850 for the Base Package

Everything else in the 60k package can wait until you actually hit 60k.

DIY the engine and cabin filters; both are 10-minute jobs and cost $30 total online. At 55k the brake fluid is probably fine-Subaru says 30k, but if you’re not seeing dark fluid or a spongy pedal you can punt that to the 60k mark too. Keep receipts to protect the CPO warranty.

The issue begins when the battery is low (80% or so), the transmission starts acting weird, and it does not want to shift out of first gear. I charged up the battery and reset the computers by both leaving the negative battery terminal disconnected for an hour and the manual method with the key and gas pedal. I checked the fluid level, and it is good. The fluid was changed less than a year ago, and it doesn’t smell or look brown.

Once I reset the computers, it now only shifts from first to second at about 2500-2700 RPM with fairly hard acceleration, where it used to shift at about 2K. It will shift a 2K if I take my foot off the gas pedal, but it shifts hard. If I let it get to 2.5K, it shifts smoothly. Second to third still seems normal.

We have heard no noises and nothing funny going on with the differential so is there anything else that could explain this sludge/metallic shavings? He doesn’t tow anything hardly ever just to and back from work. We have no clue if it’s a bearing or a gear. I said he could pull the diff cover off to see the gears only to find out that it’s a closed system :( So the few question I have are: is this a sign the diff is going bad?

Pop + screeching usually means your **A/C compressor clutch or serpentine belt gave out**. First thing: check under the hood to see if the belt is intact and look at the A/C compressor pulley (passenger side, low on engine). If the clutch looks burnt or the pulley’s stuck, the compressor likely seized. Also check for oily residue around the A/C lines or condenser that would mean a refrigerant leak.

If it’s the compressor, it’ll need replacing (common on older Tacomas). If it’s just the belt or a blown line, that’s cheaper. Start with a visual check before buying parts."

Personally at that mileage I'd want to check over anything rubber. Gaskets, grommets, bushings, etc. For example if the valve cover gasket is leaking, it's not a bad idea to replace it at some point. 

Fluids too, more importantly. Transmission fluid, coolant, brake fluid, power steering fluid, check if those are good (aka not burnt or too old) and replace as needed. Brake fluid and power steering fluid need to be bled if you do them.

VCC to 3.3V
GND to GND
CE to pin 9
CSN to pin 10
SCK to pin 13
MOSI to pin 11
MISO to pin 12
IRQ (not used)
2. Coding the Transceivers

Transceiver A Code (Receiver)

#include <SPI.h>
#include <nRF24L01.h>
#include <RF24.h>

RF24 radio(9, 10); // CE, CSN

const byte address[6] = ""00001"";

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  radio.begin();
  radio.openWritingPipe(address);
  radio.setPALevel(RF24_PA_MAX);
  radio.stopListening();
}

void loop() {
  if (radio.available()) {
    char text[32] = """";
    radio.read(&text, sizeof(text));
    Serial.println(text);
    radio.write(&text, sizeof(text));
  }
}

Transceiver B Code (Transmitter)

#include <SPI.h>
#include <nRF24L01.h>
#include <RF24.h>

RF24 radio(9, 10); // CE, CSN

const byte address[6] = ""00001"";

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  radio.begin();
  radio.openReadingPipe(0, address);
  radio.setPALevel(RF24_PA_MAX);
  radio.startListening();
}

void loop() {
  if (radio.available()) {
    char text[32] = """";
    radio.read(&text, sizeof(text));
    Serial.println(text);
    radio.write(&text, sizeof(text));
  }
}
Uploading the Code

Connect both Arduino boards to your computer.
Upload the receiver code to Transceiver A and the transmitter code to Transceiver B using the Arduino IDE.
4. Initiating the Attack


Place Transceiver A near the vehicle.
Place Transceiver B near the key fob.

Power on both transceivers and ensure they are communicating with each other.

Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE for both transceivers to ensure they are relaying signals correctly.

Since the mid-20-teens, GMs don't charge their AGMs fast at all.  And a short tripped car can kill it's own battery from lack of charging.   A two hour long daytime cruise with lights off and AC off will not charge an AGM from a dead jump start.   It'll be dead the next day again.  Even when there's nothing wrong with the battery itself except that it's low on charge.

GM AGM charging circuits have variable charging voltages that come on and turn off depending on multiple factors (state of charge of the battery, temperature of the battery, and other electrical demands in the car).  Because of bad engineering (over-conservative programming which attempts to protect the AGM battery from thermal degradation), they end up charging far less then they need to to keep the AGM battery topped up.

Here's what you can do:

1. Drive the car with the headlights on all the time.  This creates a high power demand and forces the alternator into high voltage mode and will continuously charge the battery.   Just remember to turn them back off when you stop ;-)
2. Put an AGM rated battery tender on the car every month or so for 24-48 hrs to keep it topped up.   Right now you will probably need a 3 AMP charger/tender on the car for 48-72 hrs to get it back up to normal.

NOCO makes a basic AGM tender for $30, and has more powerful models with more features.   And there are plenty of others.  I use a 4 Amp CTEK on my 2017 V8 Chevy and it can charge the big AGM in about 48-72 hours, and can keep it topped up just fine.  I also use it on my other cars as periodic maintenance.   My Ctek like the more expensive NOCOs has built-in diagnostics that can detect (and correct) some battery defects.   My CTEK has saved me from 2 premature battery replacements and paid for itself 3x.

If work was done on the car very recently, someone may have knicked a wire or forgot to plug something back in, or may have dammaged something. Also, ask if they got a phone charger in the car that can draw power while the car is off, though in this case, it sounds unlikely. 



personally id avoid the dealership, go to MULTIPLE  parts stores and explain the situation(oireilly napa ect), and ask about shops that specialize in American vehicles or just really reputable.  

The only issue that may arise is that since the vehicle is still so new, shops may not have access to wiring diagrams/vehicle diagrams to diagnose the issue. 



The best thing you can do any time you have an issue with a vehicle is monitor the vehicle for the tech you work with. What temperature is it when it dies during the day and night?

A regulator is not terribly difficult to replace if you want to make a go at it, there should be plenty of videos to guide you. If you buy the cheaper one and replace it yourself it probably won't last as long, but you will know how to change it out if it fails again.

She has a 2006 Buick Allure. Its got body damage and several known and unknown mechanical issues. A few days ago it completely died while she was on the highway home after work. Shes only had it about a year and its just been one issue after another.

Her dad was able to figure out what happened on her way home, she described it to me as: ""AC compressor fell off, tore the belt leaving 2 bolts seared off in the block, cannot by pass ac compressor as I would still have to replace the compressor with an idler pulley bringing me back to the 2 seared bolts.""

She mentioned it has transmission issues, engine is leaking, etc. So considering how much is wrong with the car, I doubt she'd get much money for it as a trade in (or even a private sale) regardless of if she would be able to get it driving again, not to mention she'd have to take it to an actual mechanic since her dad already tried to fix it, but doesn't have the tools to essentially dissect it to get to the problem. I figure she'd be looking at spending hundreds to thousands of dollars getting it drivable for a trade in, to possibly not even get as much as she spent fixing it back for the trade in towards a different one. 

So, kind car people, please help us make a decision here... should she get it drivable before the trade in? Is that car even worth anything to begin with? Or should she just keep her money, trade it in knowing it doesn't drive, and call it a day.

1nbusgc,My Mazda Demio's (1999) engine shuts down when going at low speeds and the engine isn't revving. More info below.,"I bought this car in January for a dirt cheap price, it had an issue of overheating when going at slow speeds but the price was low so even with repairs it would be worth it. 

It had this issue with its engine shutting down since when i bought it. It happened specifically when the car seemed to overheat (?), but it wasn't terrible, it would just do it when i was stuck in a traffic jam for too long in the city, but I'm mostly living in the countryside so i didn't have that issue much. 

Also the car overheats when in traffic, and as far as I've noticed, that's when the engine is more prone to shutting down while idling.

I put a brand new radiator long ago, and the issue was still more or less the same. The water pump belt also seems to be working properly so it doesn't seem like what's causing the overheating.

The engine has 390k km, around 240k miles and so my suspicion was that the gasket must have been blown from the mileage. 

Also i somehow suspect that the previous owners far from took proper care of the car with frequent oil changes, and so the engine having gotten worn out could be another possibility.

The fan seems to not be working for the most part, but somehow there are times it does, even if the car is running at the same temperature. 

My mechanic also told me in the past that it's likely that the previous owners must have removed the thermostat, and when i went to replace the radiator this other person also verified it by testing with running water from a hose into the pipes and as far as i remember it came out immediately without any blockages so he said it's likely that there's no thermostat? I can't remember clearly if he concluded safely with that.

These were my main suspicions up until 3 days ago, because the car's issue has been exactly the same since January, and i did 20k miles on it since then, but 3 days ago i left the key turned on while the engine was off, for longer than what i should have left it turned on apparently (charging my phone) and the battery got drained. It felt like the battery got drained faster than what it should have had (i think maybe it was an hour? Whereas there were times in the past when i left it for much longer, but I'm also doing this frequently, though I'm also driving like 30 miles a day, so i don't know if it's another issue with the battery not charging properly or if i just overdid it with charging my phone).  

So, i left the key turned, the battery ran out, and we jump started the car with cables and the help od another car. 

I'm mentioning all of this because the car's issue with the engine shutting down got much worse after this. The engine doesn't shut down only when the car is idling and after it has overheated now, but it's also shutting down while moving and going slowly, with the first or second gear, around the turns where you have to release gas and push the brakes. Or going slowly downhill and releasing the gas. So basically if the engine isn't revving, it shuts down.

I'm not sure if it's related with the battery having gotten drained on that day, but the chances of the car getting worse on that same day that the battery got drained seem to be too low for it to be a coincidence. So i imagine that the fact that the battery ""died out"" somehow affected the car, or the car ""died out"" more easily because there was maybe an issue with the car which had the battery not charging properly? Also, the engine seems to be shutting down after the battery incident even when the car doesn't seem to be overheated.

The last thing i would like to mention is also that I've been running the car with really little gas in the tank way too frequently lately, (almost empty), and i understand that it's likely to damage the fuel pump, so I'm wondering if it could also be that?

Some additional info that i can think of is that there doesn't seem to be any ""milkshakes"" in the engine when i remove the cap to check the oil quality, though the car does seem to be losing a small amount of coolant every few thousand kilometres of driving, but it still has more than plenty of coolant in there and only needs some topping up. No external leaks as far as i can see.

I'm not really a mechanic myself, nor do i know much about cars, but considering that the engine goes off even when the car is not overheated now, my own guess would be that it might be something with the alternator?

Hence the battery not charging properly and why it got worse after the battery incident, though it's what's caused the battery incident itself in the first place?

And issues with the electrical system could also explain why the fan is working only sometimes? Though it could be something completely different.

1nbswcm,What can mimic a bad wheel bearing?,"TLDR: Wheel bearing sound and vibration above 40mph. Still present after replacing all bearings, control arms, tie rods, and ball joints. What else could cause it? 

I have a 2007 Toyota Avalon with about 165k miles. I'm getting a noise that sounds like a bad wheel bearing noticeable at about 30mph and faster. The sound gets worse when turning right and better when turning left. 

I jacked up the car and did not feel play in either rear wheel. One front wheel had some play. I tried spinning the wheel while holding the strut, and I tried using a long breaker bar as an improvised stethoscope against the strut. I did not feel or hear anything in the strut while spinning the wheel. 

The tire that had some play had an obviously bad tie rod end and the ball joints on both sides had torn boots. I ended up purchasing Moogs front end kit (was not much more expensive than the ball joints and outer tie rods) and replaced the tie rods, ball joints, and control arms on both sides. The play in the wheel disappeared, but the bearing sound and vibration remained. 

I had one of the rear hubs replaced about two years ago (same exact symptoms as I'm currently experiencing, resolved after replacing rear passenger hub). I had purchased a hub, but was unable to remove the old one two years ago and ended up paying a shop to do it. I still had the hub I originally purchased so I replaced that hub, and purchased another hub for the opposite side. No luck, sound and vibration remained. I then purchased bearings for the front and brought the steering knuckles to a local shop to have the old bearing pressed out and new ones pressed in. Still no change in the vibration or the sound. 

I'm not a mechanic, and I feel like I'm probably missing something basic. What else could make this type of noise?

Tires themselves can make very similar noises to a bad bearing. Any irregular wear but in particular heel/toe and cupping tend to be the loudest. Tires typically start making noise at lower speeds and get louder with speed and don’t usually change with direction but as with everything there’s always an exception. Other bearings are a possibility as well, output shaft bearings, if it’s AWD a carrier bearing, things like this can also make noise. Another rare one is a CV axle, more typical failure will be clicking during turns or a vibration on deceleration but if your sure everything else is good I have had odd vibrations from CV axles that vibrate just right to make noise. A couple other things to look at anyway. If all else fails see if you can rent a lift or have a mechanic drive the car on the lift, helps narrow down where the noise is coming from.

1nbrus1,2003 Outback H6 Fuse 11 Issue,"I’m trying to figure out why fuse 11 keeps blowing in my 2003 Outback H6. At first, it would blow repeatedly until I unplugged a large gray connector in the engine bay, right next to the intake manifold (I think it was labeled E2 or E3 in repair manual). After unplugging and then reconnecting that connector, the fuse stopped blowing and i got the engine to start, but I got a check engine light.

I let the car sit overnight, and by the next day the check engine light went away on its own. However, the following morning, while driving, the fuse started blowing again and kept doing so until I repeated the unplug/re-plug process. Once again, the fuse stopped blowing, but the check engine light came back. This time I cleared the code manually, and since then the light hasn’t returned. The check engine code is P0118.

So far I've tested the coolant temperature sensor and followed the harness wiring past the plug to see if i could find any wear and tear on the wires. No luck so far, hoping someone can help.



The fuse has blown one other time but it was more simple the last time. That time it blew I added some fuel to the car and re-placed the fuse, haven't had the problem for a few months until now.



The only pattern I’ve noticed is that both times this fuse has blown, my fuel level was relatively low (maybe 1/8 tank).

I ended up bypassing it, but later my car overheated due to a blown head gasket (which I didn’t know at the time). Around then, the radiator cap also broke off the radiator, so I had to replace that too.

After I finally figured out the head gasket issue, my water pump went out and I replaced that as well. The car was still drivable for a bit, but then the timing belt snapped while I was driving. Since it’s an interference engine, the valves got damaged, and now one of the cylinders has no compression at all. I’m planning to swap in a new engine eventually.

I have a company who specializes in this kind of detailing coming out tomorrow to do a deep and intense clean of the whole thing, but I’m having one problem. 

The dealership doesn’t want to check out the seal of my car until the mold is cleaned out, and the mold detailing guys don’t want to do the work without the seal being fixed. 

The moisture clearly came from a bad door seal on the driver’s side, which I believe is the case bc the area where the driver’s seat meets the door panel area is where the mold was definitely the worst. 

I wish I had had the foresight to think to see if the seatbelt on that side had been closed in the door because now I’m not certain if it’s the gasket that’s the problem (assuming I’m using “gasket” correctly — I’m trying to talk about the rubber tube-y thing that is runs along the entire length of the door jamb) or if I did do what has indeed happened many times in my 12 or so years with this car and accidentally left the belt in the gap of the door jamb, leading the door to not fully seal. 

All of that said, I need a way to temporarily seal the driver’s-side door crack just in case it’s the issue. I’ll need it to only last as long as it’ll take for the car to air out after the detailer’s gone and before I can get it to the dealership. That said, I live in Georgia, which is an incredibly moist and humid state, and which has seen even more rain than the usual, albeit ridiculous, amount of rain we get in the summer. 

I’m worried that if I use tape, that it’ll mark up my car’s paint job/finish, and I’d like to avoid that if at all possible. 

Also, just for the record, my car won’t be able to get in my garage as it is, and there’s nothing I can do about that.

Hate to be the guy who goes of tangent and questions the diagnosis but I'm not convinced you have a totally failed chain. If it still runs but then shuts down shortly after then clearly the timing chain is still turning the cams so can't have failed completely. If it had then the engine wouldn't run whatsoever. I mean maybe you've got a failed tensioner, maybe it's stretched out of tolerance or some other timing/chain related fault but it really can't be a snapped chain.

I get why any issue with the timing would recommend a new chain - as you've got to go in there anyway - but you're going to be (and seem to already be) getting comments who are assuming the chain has completely let go and caused terminal damage. Which it would, IF it totally went, but from your description it hasn't so your risk of other damage is substantially lower (but not none existent)."

1nbzd3o,"Rejecting & returning my car to Arnold Clark dealership, please someone help me, I’m completely lost!","Hi guys, so bear with me as this is a long one, and I’m so extremely frustrated with this whole ordeal.

So I bought an Abarth 595 Competizione from Arnold Clark Leyland branch on July the 10th, i traveled over 100 miles for the car as there wasn’t one I thought was as good locally, how wrong was I! I paid cash through bank payment, as I wanted to own the car outright and not have any finance.

On my drive home I could hear a vibrating, metal rattling sound coming from the back of the exhaust, I could also hear a weird high pitched sound coming from both door speakers, and the centre console that controls the A/C & heating.

The next day I called the branch up to report the issues, and as it came with 3 month warranty, they recommended I call warranty head office to get the car booked in with a local Arnold Clark to get it looked at. So it was then booked in with Arnold Clark Chesterfield for diagnostics on the 17th July.

They deemed that the middle centre pipe of the exhaust was where the noise was coming from, they faulted the speakers, & the centre console. I then waited for a week and a half for parts to arrive, heard nothing so called them, the exhaust and centre console had arrived, but the speakers hadn’t as they were on back order apparently!

The car then went in for repair at the start of August, the centre pipe was replaced and the centre console, I got a phone call to collect the car back later that day. When I arrived, and was handed the keys, the service staff dealing with me said unfortunately while fitting your new centre console the technician broke the plastic surround trims as he couldn’t remove them, so we have ordered you some new ones to replace them, I was fuming about this, as if he had removed them properly and used a proper tool to unclip them that wouldn’t have happened.

I then started the car & straight away the exhaust was making the same rattling noise and it clearly hadn’t been fixed. I fetched the service staff and said the issue isn’t fixed, the exhaust is still the same and now you’ve damaged the inside of my car this is unacceptable, she apologised but said she would need to talk to warranty head office, & suggest it might be best to take the car to a Fiat & Abarth specialist for further investigation into the exhaust as they couldn’t fix it.

The car was then booked in for the 2nd of September with a local Fiat & Abarth specialist to myself. The time frame was just unacceptable to me, but I felt like there was absolutely nothing I could do. Arnold Clark have been nothing short of terrible in their customer service and getting this issue resolved in a timely manner.

Then around 3 weeks ago I decided I’d had enough and wanted to reject the vehicle, they’ve already had ONE opportunity to fix the issue and couldn’t, so surely that was my right to reject. I called the selling branch up spoke to a sales manager called Josh and was told that I couldn’t go down the route of right to reject until Fiat & Abarth had looked at the car themselves and faulted the car. I tried to explain to Josh, that yourselves at Arnold Clark already faulted the car on the 17th of July when you had it in for diagnostics, you then attempted repairs of the car 2 weeks later but couldn’t fix it, and that’s why it’s been booked in to Fiat.

I said I’m just fed up now, I’ve had enough of waiting and I want to reject the car, as I’ve got life stuff going on, and haven’t got time to keep wasting with this. He basically fobbed me off, made me believe I had no rights and couldn’t do anything and I felt lost and didn’t have a choice but to wait.

I then found Arnold Clark’s head office number, called them and wanted to escalate the situation higher and get it sorted. Explained all the situation to them from start upto that point. Heard nothing back, I have called so many times I’ve lost count! All they keep saying is we’re looking into it and it takes time, how much time do they need!

So then my car finally went to Fiat & Abarth last Tuesday, they did a health check and looked at issues, and found that the whole back box section needed replacing due to the actuator being faulty, now these abarth’s have a monza exhaust system which will cost around £1400 to replace. They also there was a smell of fuel from the engine, but would need to investigate more to see where that’s coming from and what the issue is there.

So I then called the selling branch back, on the 3rd of September, spoke to Josh again, who apparently had no recollection of my previous chat with him whatsoever surprise surprise! He told him that enough was enough and that I now want a full refund and I want to reject the vehicle and want to get it returned ASAP. Josh then told me he would have to talk to the sales department and would be back in touch, I never heard anything again.

I then called Head office again to get all this documented, what Fiat had reported and that I wanted to exercise my right to return but again, they said they would document everything on their system, they would communicate with the selling branch, with the sales and technical department and be in touch, if I do have ground to reject the vehicle.

Then today Monday 8th September, I’m at boiling point, I call head office again, go through explain the whole process for what feels like the 1000th time! The automate service agent recommends I call the selling branch and ask for the Branch Manager, so I speak to a gentleman called Chris, explain the whole situation, but I can tell he just does not want to accept this vehicle back, that’s the last thing he wants.

He tells me, they have a right of one opportunity to fix the vehicle, I try to explain that you’ve already have that chance, he cuts me off and says no it’s gone to Abarth now to be fixed, I said it’s already been to you guys, once for diagnostics, and then again for the repairs which didn’t fix the issues, surely that was your ONE opportunity. But he twists it and uses the sales lingo on me to basically manipulate me to believing that that wasn’t the one opportunity and that Arnold Clark couldn’t fault the issues and that the opportunity is with Fiat & Abarth, and if they then can’t fix the issues then I can go down the right to reject.

I feel like I’m having the absolute pi** took out of me here, how can he say that Arnold
Clark couldn’t find or fault the issues, when they deemed the centre pipe was the issue, also the speakers and centre console and then did all that work, does that somehow not count in his eyes, why would they do that work, if they didn’t believe there was a fault or issue?

He then said I will ring Fiat & Abarth now and get you booked in to fully repair your car ASAP, and we will get you a courtesy car while your cars in the garage, I was very reluctant and said this isn’t what I want, but I felt pushed into it and like I had no choice but to go along with it. 5 minutes later he called me back, telling me it’s booked in for the 1st of October for the work to be done, and they will replace the exhaust and do diagnostics and checks on the engine to deem where the fuel smell is coming from.

I just felt utterly disappointed and lost at this point, but then I thought nah I’m not having this, I’m fed up, I called him back up this afternoon and said I’m not accepting this, I want to reject the car, I’m not messing around anymore, he was just rude with me, said well if that’s what you want but there’s no guarantee that the rejection will be accepted, and you’ll just end up with your car going to Fiat to be fixed anyway.

1nbyezy,2009 Clio 1.5dci Help! Please,"Hi all,

Looking for a bit of advice. I scanned my 2009 Renault Clio 1.5DCI using an OBD2 reader and got the following codes:

P0670
P0670 P (still shows after clearing)

I changed the glow plug relay/module this afternoon, but since then the engine stutter seems more noticeable, and there’s a stronger smell from the exhaust. After clearing both codes, the P0670 P still comes back.

I’ve been told this is likely down to faulty glow plugs – does that sound right to anyone here?

The car has had quite a bit of work in the last 6 months:

New oil, oil filter, air filter, and fuel filter
EGR valve replaced
Cambelt, water pump, and aux belt all done
MOT is clean
No warning lights on the dash
Car gets up to temp fine and pulls well on the motorway
Getting 55mpg+ on average

I’m a bit worried it could be injectors, but there are no error codes suggesting that.

Also wondering – could it be a blown fuse somewhere? Possibly an 80AMP? If so, does anyone know which fuse specifically relates to the glow plug circuit?

I’ve included a few photos of the OBD code and fuses.

Any help or experience would be massively appreciated!

1nbyelw,Dad's old Vauxhall Corsa - repair or scrap at 18 years old?,"Inherited my dad's 2006 Corsa with 130k miles after he passed. It's been sitting for 6 months and now has oil leaks, MOT expired, and needs new tyres. Garage quoted £900+ for everything.  
The dilemma: sentimental value vs financial sense.

Did some research and turns out Vauxhall Corsa is literally the most scrapped car model in the UK. At 18 years old, it's bang on the average age when most cars get binned. Oil leaks are apparently the #1 MOT failure leading to scrapping too.

Part of me thinks dad would laugh at spending nearly a grand on his old banger, but it feels wrong just ditching it. Been looking at scrap-my-car options and the quotes are surprisingly decent for something this old.

CarTalkUK wisdom needed:

* Anyone kept an 18-year-old Corsa going worth it?
* Is £900 mental for a car worth maybe £1,500?
* Should sentiment factor into car decisions?

Oil leak, completely depends where it is coming from. If it's the 1.2 petrol, then it is common for them to leak from the oil from the oil pressure sensor at the front, drivers side of the engine. The oil can also track down the wires and make it appear it is leaking elsewhere. Good news, if it is the sensor, for less than £30 you can get a new part and a spanner to replace it. If the leak is from elsewhere, the it may be a larger and more expensive job.

MOT will depend on what's deteriorated while its been sitting. Unfortunately you won't know for sure until you get it tested.

Is it worth it? It's a Corsa, they're pretty bog standard cars, but they also have a charm about them. On the other hand, it is a car known to you, and one that you know most of the issues with. Getting another car could be an unknown, especially if you're only looking to spend a similar amount to the Corsa's repair costs.

1nbogka,Jaecoo 7 - An Honest Opinion From Someone Who Drives One But Doesn't Own It...,"I've struggled to find an honest review of the Jaecoo 7. Either seems to be slated just for being Chinese, or given over the top accolades it doesn't (IMHO) deserve. 

So, I'm dropping this here in the hope it helps someone who is currently looking and struggling to decide. For clarity, I pay around £440 a month inc. VAT, tax, tyres and servicing on a 1+23 personal lease with 10k mpa. So zero deposit, that's all I pay per month and about £20 of that was because I didn't want the standard white colour. The car model is the 1.5 PHEV Luxury spec. I've had it for 5 months. 

So I saw a WhatCar YouTube video canning this motor recently and I thought ""ah, they're going to talk about the issues I have with it"" and then they just spoke about handling and how the MG HS is a much better handling car. I mean, maybe it is, but I've driven the Jaecoo for 5 months and haven't had any handling issues of note - OK it doesn't corner like a GT3 but I doubt the two kids or the dog I've got in the back of it would be too happy if it did. And I think people can be forgiven for wanting to look further than the HS - which (IMHO) is a very, very beige motor. 

So the good stuff first. The fuel economy is brilliant. I charged it 4 or 5 times between filling it up the first time and needing to fill it up again, and the ODO was over 900 miles when I was at the pump for the second time. It's a nicer drive in full electric mode than HEV mode as well, as the petrol engine roars a bit when going up some of the hills around me once the battery is depleted. But for the most part it handles well - I drive a very diverse mix of roads from single track lanes to motorway miles, so it gets a good run about. 

It stands out. It does turn heads. Now whether that's because people are going ""Oh that looks cool"" or ""is that a Range Rover off Temu?"" is probably 50/50, but at least in this I'm entirely confident the wife won't be pulled out of it at knife point in central Birmingham like people are in RRs... 

Some of the tech is very good. The sunroof is massive. The big screen has a Tesla vibe and the camera system (especially when indicating at a junction) is very cool. The HUD works well, and the vented seats have been ace this summer. The big downside is no heated windscreen option. 

Some of the tech is, and I am not exaggerating here, absolutely horrendous. The lane keeping is aggressive to the point of being outright dangerous. On single track lanes around where I live it will aggressively try to pull you into the path of oncoming vehicles as you drift onto a verge to make room. It does equally horrendous stuff in other 'normal' situations as well, like near me there's a two lane A road that as you approach a kind of junction the markings stop - but it's still two lanes. The car will absolutely try and pull you into the car next to you so you can be in the 'middle' of the 'lane' as it now only sees one. 

The 'Driver Monitoring System' is infuriating. It lets off a siren if your eyes are off the road for more than a second - and this is doubly infuriating when the reason your eyes are off the road is because you realised you've forgotten to turn the lane assist off and you're trying to do so before the car pulls you under the lorry at the side of you. 

The speed assist is also way OTT. Having the speed limit signs in the HUD is helpful and I like to keep that one, but I have to turn off the alert. Having a car agressively bong at you because you've drifted to 51 in a 50 is a PITA. 

So before EVERY journey, I have to turn those three things off in the control screen. There is no way to permanently deactivate these features. Turning them off gets old real fast, and if you don't, the car is borderline undrivable. 

The DAB radio is woeful. When it goes for a service I may have to get them to replace the antennae as it can't possibly be this bad as normal. For clarity, I have a 7 or 8 year old Ranger with a DAB equally as old that has faultless signal where I live. The Jaecoo can barely hold an audible signal for more than a few seconds. So for radio I have to use Carplay and then use the radio station's app. It's fairly intuitive, but it's another process whenever you get in. 

Now, what I will say is that aside from the DAB issue, a lot of these issues are becoming more and more common with more and more vehicles. So the aggressive tech isn't exclusive to this car - I've heard similar things about BYD. 

And, once you've got it all turned off, it's a pretty good car to drive. It feels solid, it accelerates well enough, it's comfortable, the sound system is good, the sun roof works well, the driving position is excellent... It's a lot of car for the money. If I could permanently disable those 3 key pieces of tech it would be brilliant - but I cannot stress enough how miserable the driving experience is when those features are left on. 

Oh, and the boot is pretty small for a car that size. 

But for 2 years at £440 a month all in, it still feels like a deal. And it is a lot cooler than a MG HS or a Qashqai, even the most staunch hater of Chinese motors would have to admit that. 

  
TL:DR - Make sure you test drive one for a long, long time. And I would recommend a lease over purchasing one as I wouldn't want anything to do with that tech (or unproven depreciation values) once it's out of warranty.

Looking for some advice for my brother. He’s looking for a new car as his old and battered Fiesta will likely fail MOT in 6 week’s time and cost more to repair than it’s worth. 

Key points:
- annual mileage 5k tops
- short journeys & commuting 
- lives with parents, has access to Home Charging for EV
- expects to keep the vehicle long-term (5yrs+), I.e. he won’t get a few years in and want something new

He’s looking at a Ford Puma Gen-E (full EV). Dealership have offered him £1500 part ex (no idea why this is so high, part ex car is only fit for scrap, but they’ve guaranteed that value). 

So a 3 year PCP offer is £5k down, £1500 part ex, (some government incentives for EV), £193.25 a month. £13,529 Balloon payment at the end of the term. 

He’s test driven it and likes it. 

My concern is that he wants to move out in the coming years so will need deposit etc. so thinking costs. 

Are there any thoughts on the above offer or any other recommendations? He’s not been that “in to” cars so isn’t after anything too amazing. Cheers!

1nbmqpw,"""Hot"" hatch guidance.","Hi All, 

I drive a pretty knackered 2017 BMW 1Series. It is 3 doors, manual and took a bit of a beating when i was using it to commute to my Cabling engineer role on site when i first purchased that car, the part ex valuation is around £4/4.5k 

I have a son now, and work from home permanently so the commute isnt such an issue, but I would like something both practical and fun. As this may be the last car purchase I make before the EV Charge picks up more steam towards the 2030s, Something with a bit of umph behind the exhaust tones etc would also be quite nice. 

I need to have 5 doors, and ideally auto is my preference.  I don't want anything overly large as my Mrs drives a Skoda Karoq that we got recently for the lions share of child-carrying/family journeys, however I need the 5 door space for the odd times I will be carrying passengers/my child.

  
My question is, what are peoples thoughts on my current shortlist of cars and where would your personal preference be (and why) or if there are any alternatives that tick the boxes. - (I have been looking at 2022 or newer on most of these.

BMW M135i with MPRO/Aero Pack. 

BMW M235i (Not sold on the shape of these if I'm honest)

VW Golf (GTI Clubsport/R Price/Mileage Dependent) 

Skoda Octavia VRS (lower power output than previous 2 mentioned but likely the most practical given the Fastback/Saloon body type) 

  
What would your feelings be towards my shortlist, and any advice/alternatives also welcome. 

I'm not married to brands or anything like that so quite open, but you get what I'm looking at with the shortlist so anything similar would be an interesting option.

1nbl84y,DPF Issues Need Advice,"It wouldn't be Car Talk UK without another DPF issue post.

I have trawled DPF posts here and haven't found much, as I know it's a tricky one, but I'm looking for people who may have had the same issue as me with my specific car.

I currently have a 2.0 2014 Ford Mondeo on 137k miles. Engine light came up on Saturday, and started coming up with limp mode message yesterday.

What's strange is it doesn't feel like limp mode, as with other cars I've driven it's not limiting much. I can drive it normally without waiting a little bit for it to reach 20/30mph. But if I put my foot down it's noticeable.

The car has FSH aswell so it's been looked after.

Here are the two codes I have from a quick iCarly car reader scan (my mate done the scan).

246300 - DPF - Soot Accumulation 
246BOO - Vehicle conditions incorrect for regeneration 

I've looked online too and people saying could be a lot of different options, one I found said it was just a sensor that was the culprit.

Apprehensive_Shoe_39 (Score: 1): I'm not sure if it's the same with Fords, but with VW cars once the DPF light comes on due to a full, or near full DPF it will completely stop regenerating. If you continue to drive it the DPF will get worse and worse until potentially it's irrecoverable. What's bad is that some people decide a long drive will fix it, which is the worse thing you can do as it's never going to start an active regen without intervention.

Again this is for VWs. Ford may have different behaviour but the advice I would give is read up on it before driving it any more. The VW behaviour is basically ""stop driving. You aren't allowing me to regen enough and now I'm getting full but I'm not toast *yet*. Take me to someone who understands, they will manually start a regen and drive in accordance with the parameters needed for me to regenerate and recover the DPF"".

ALSO, the limp mode (in mine at least) is similar to you. Doesn't seem in limp mode on 1/3 to 1/2 throttle but pegs it above, and when getting to 35ish it just won't go any faster.

Frembrit (Score: 1): As mentioned it will be the DPf fuel vaporiser in the exhaust pipe, it gets blocked up with carbon deposits over time which then prevents diesel from being sprayed in to the exhaust to heat it up to 600 °C in order to perform a regen.
The vaporiser consist of a fuel line, glow plug and and pipe to deliver the vaporised fuel in to the exhaust.

Any competent mechanis can replace it but would ideally read the codes first to fully understand what's happening. Your codes are saying that soot is building up and that the condition for a regen are not met...usually it hasn't got hot enough because the vaporiser is blocked/not working.
Once it has been changed any error codes need to be reset as well as the DPf learned values.

I owned a 2011 Mondeo 2.2 TXS for 11 years and change the vaporiser on it twice. The DPf was never blocked that it needed to be cleaned by a specialist, even when it went in to limp mode (before I knew the above). Although in my case I couldn't drive it on open roads in limp mode, it was very slow. 

Have a look on the Talkford forums, loads of posts there from an originally Mondeo only forum. I've got a post there with photos showing the vaporiser.

Aftermarket cost just for the vaporiser is about £110
Genuine Ford is/was over £250."

So low sun in the west has lost a lot of its light intensity to the atmosphere and very often doesn’t actually trigger the reaction effectively. I had a very short period of time investigating this, but I found them to be deeply unpredictable and with the additional problem of occasionally plunging you into unexpected darkness, at least perceptually so.

I always look for lots of history as any car will go wrong if it hasn't had good money spent on it. Regular servicing is important and also cross reference the MOT history to see if advisories were seen to in a timely fashion. Also check for signs of rust and damage underneath the car. 


Make sure you understand the service schedule for the car too. It might need a water pump at 120k miles for example, so factor things like that into your decision and budgeting for running the car. I would recommend knowing how to do an oil & filter change yourself, it's £200ish to get mine done at a shop but only £45 in parts and an hour of my time. 


Lastly, try and be a detective when buying. Manual cars from London experience lots more wear on 1st & 2nd gear while cars from the middle of Scotland take a beating on suspension. Ask the seller for paperwork and look at the addresses for the garages it's been serviced at to take a guess of how hard a life this car has had. Motorway miles are considered to be good miles - with the engine up to temperature and less acceleration than doing the school run - although it's hard to prove whether a car has been used for that.

I got it during Covid so i have the N-Line version (only one i could get at the time) which has stupid attempt at sporty seats , i'm 6 foot 2 so the plastic bits in them don't sit on my body right which makes long drives annoying. For someone normal size it's probably ok.


Equally it came with 19"" alloys as part of the N-line thing, which makes the ride bumpier than i'd like. 


Not all models have ACC if that's important to you, it's the one thing I wish it would have. 
Interior is quite plasticy, doesn't both me , but there are buttons (kind of, plastic that you press on) to do things so there aren't any common features hidden in menus or anything like that.


Worth noting that the Sportage and Tucson are the same car with a different body kit on it since Kia/Hyundai are sister companies. 


We choose it because of the interior space - other cars we looked at felt cramped up front for both driver and passenger, this doesn't at all.
