1ny9ib1,Am I cooked? Need advice,"I just realized today... I have NEVER changed the oil in my CVT. Its a 2015 mitisubshi RVR, 235000 km. Mostly highway driving. 

I dunno how i made it this far honestly without realizing, I change my oil every 10,000 km on the motor, and even did the differential fluid around 125,000 km.

To be fair, life has been kind of wild for me over the last few years, i honestly dont know how this slipped my mind for so long... ooooof.

Iv been contemplating replacing the vehicle, due to its age but want to keep it as long as I can to save for something newer. Its fully paid of and today when considering how long it might survive before the engine or CVT die, it became clear to me I have completely neglected the CVT. 

There is no whining, no slipping, nothing wrong with it that indicates any issues presently. Somehow...

So what do I do? What would you do?

- Maybe drain half, and top it up? And again in 10-15k?

I recently purchased a 2018 jeep wrangler JL and have noticed that after I stat the jeep up and drive it around for 15 min or so ( engine is warmed up) there is a knocking/pinging noise when pressing the throttle and the engine is under load. Goes away above a certain rpm.

It doesn’t occur at all when I first start the car up or when it’s warmed up and in park. Only in drive and accelerating lightly. 

I’ve tried running 93 octane. Tried fuel ejector cleaning. Tried Chamber cleaning at the dealer. Tried flashing PCM and TCM at the dealer. And I’ve changed the PCV valve. None of them seemed to work. 

It seems temperature related and is more noticeable when driving past a wall or barrier with the windows down.

My first and current car is a turbo 1.6l diesel VW van from 1989.

But when starting in first gear, i always just drive without touching the gas pedal. The thing goes to like 10km/h just biting the clutch.

Now i learnt the lesson and accelerate when i bite the clutch but i always feel strange doing it.

**Make/Model:** 2016 Chevrolet Cruze Limited RS, 6-spd automatic  
**Engine:** ECOTEC TURBO 1.4L Variable   
**Mileage:** \~66,000 km

**Video and images:** [https://imgur.com/a/81DJjWi](https://imgur.com/a/81DJjWi)   
—

Took my car in last week for a diagnostic on a bunch of errors I received over the last few weeks — primarily when I would start my car, but sometimes when it was just in a low gear. The errors would not happen every time I drove, but relatively regularly, and they seemed pretty random and only electrical in nature, and would only come up briefly and then disappear. Occasionally, when the errors would pop up while I was actually driving, the car would slow down, and the radio cut out once.

**These original errors were:**

* Service Stabilitrak
* Service Power Steering
* Service Traction Control
* Service Theft Deterrant System (this one only happened when I would start the car, and was the most rare of the 4)

The shop (my Chevy dealership) ran a bunch of tests and couldn’t get the errors to come up on their own original test drive, but my battery, which was less than 3 years old and under warranty, failed all of the tests, so they replaced it. They cleared the errors and after test driving it with the new battery, it was fine and the errors didn’t come back. Great. I picked it up on Wednesday and ran some errands, then parked it at home — did not have any issues that whole evening. I worked from home Thurs/Fri and didn’t leave the house, so the car just stayed in my driveway. 

**This morning (Saturday), I went to start my car and it turned over for a solid 2 seconds and then cut off, and then wouldn’t turn over at all with the exception of a second or two every 5 attempts.** The brand-new battery voltage is sitting at 12 v in park, so that’s fine. I am able to get my car back into the shop this coming week, but I was hoping someone might have a better idea of what the issue is, since it’s not the battery, nor battery cables (which I guess they also checked last week). I know electronic issues are a pain to diagnose, and it could be any number of things.

**These new errors** ***(All of the previous 4 errors, plus)*****:**

* Service Airbag
* Open, Then Close Driver Window
* Radio sometimes kicks on and then off (but the infotainment screen is always on)
* If the engine turns over, it only turns over for a few seconds and then stops, and the A/C does come on when the engine is briefly running

**History:**

* April 2016 - Bought the car brand-new
* Dec 2022 - Replaced factory battery with new one
* June 2024 - Replaced PCV under special cvg warranty
* Oct 2024 - Got into an accident and the front end of my car was damaged
   * Repaired/replaced mostly just exterior body parts and headlights, but also some interior mounting pieces under the hood as well as the horn pigtail and assembly in terms of electrical
* Jan 2025 - Replaced charge air cooler under special cvg warranty
* Oct 2025 - Replaced battery under warranty

I’ve kept up with regular oil changes and maintenance, and plug my block heater in and let the car warm up when it’s chilly (I’m in Canada). 

—

**So, TL;DR:**

* Car was throwing a bunch of random electronic errors at seemingly random intervals, including at ignition
* Shop couldn’t replicate the errors test drives, but ran diagnostics and my battery failed load tests, so they replaced it under warranty, cleared the errors in the system, test drove it, said it was a battery issue, and stated that it was fixed
   * The shop also looked at the battery cables and said they were fine, since I saw that that's a common issue with the Cruze
* I picked it up on Wednesday, ran some errands, and then parked it at home - no issues
* Tried starting it for the first time since Wednesday this morning (Saturday) and now it’s throwing all of the previous issues as well as a few more and will barely start, and if it does, it’s only momentarily
* Checked battery voltage and the (new) battery is normal at 12v in park

What could be the cause, what can I point to when I bring it back to the shop this week, and is there anything I can do at home to troubleshoot? Is it also possible that this is an issue that could be traced back to when my car was in the bodyshop last year and they were replacing parts in the front end? Could a pinched wire/cable cause issues almost a year later, or am I just grasping at straws?

1ny5juw,Drain plug replacement problems,"Stripped the plug, couldnt use an oversized plug, so re-drilled and then tapped new threads to from m12 to m14 size and inserted the timesert with some JB weld to help seal it. Put the new plug in good tight but not too tight beacuse I'm afraid to restrip the threads.

Problem is re-threading it just barely worked it felt like, and it was a pain to get it started, this ended up having the threads not be straight or I didn't drill the hole straight. Now there is a gap where the oil plug gasket should be sitting.

I thought I would say screw it and JB it sealed but the oil flow just pushes a new path through the liquid JB before it can cure.

Current idea: use rethread tool to clean up the threads (might not work because of old JB weld in there) and then put the timesert/helicoil back in w new JB and then use multiple gaskets to help fill the space?

 when you get in there to the G300 and G320 grounds.. after you have checked verified the 7 steps of the voltage drop test above.. 

 you can find a good body ground or use a single jumper cable to one volt meter test lead probe. the other probing into the cavities with the black wires on the ground splice blocks.. in 20 volt DC scale..  you with the engine running. you should NOT see more than 0.04 volts on any of them..

 you can set the meter to 200 OHMS of resistance.  probe the  bolt into the ground strap on the splice block after you have taken it off and cleaned any corrosion off that and the splice block tab.. measure resistance from the bolt head into each of the cavities  should be the same as if you touched your multimeter test leads together.. if you don't have a good digital multimeter. got home depot..

1ny3g03,Tips on not stripping out my next master cylinder?,"2012 Toyota Prius, base model gen 3, 1.8l 4cyl.

So I was tackling a bigger job than I'm used to, replacing the brake booster pump/accumulator on my girlfriend's Prius, save about 2500$.

I was almost completely done when I noticed the last brake line I fastened back to the master cylinder was leaking. Backed it out, Spent about an hour trying to line it up straight and make sure I wasn't cross threading, but when I finally thought I had it, it went in wrong, stripped the threads on the master cylinder.

So I already thought about helicoil and thread repair, and I'm pretty positive I'm just gonna spend 100 on the shit to do that and it still won't work. So I ordered a new master cylinder. Toyota recommends replacing it with the brake booster pump anyway.

Thing is I'm kinda worried I'm going to do the same thing on the new master cylinder and ruin it. I got through the whole job and only messed up that one thread, I'm pretty sure it was a fluke, but it's a 600$ fluke I can't afford to make again. Anyone got any helpful tips on reinstalling brake lines carefully or making sure they line up correctly?",1,1759606915.0,3,MechanicAdvice,1759692693,2025-10-04 19:41:55,2025-10-05 19:31:33,"blutrache666 (Score: 0): You made the right call on not attempting a helicoil.  The pressure in those lines can be a few thousand psi and that is not safe to repair that way.

Starting lines can be annoying, but the steel lines can be tweaked and bent in small amounts.  Can maybe try starting the threads with the master unbolted still to make it easier to wiggle and get the lines started by hand.  Once started you can then carefully wiggle the master onto the studs and the lines should bend with it.  Although how does your flare nut look now?  You may need to replace the flare nut if it's damaged and that can be tricky if you aren't experienced."
1ny3bh1,Bad luck or am I the problem ?,"Hey guys I""m overhauling a Corolla GTI AE92 for my my little brother (wanted him to have a nice first car), its a 4AGE bigport. Setup is VEMS ECU, ITBs, big cams, 11.5:1 compression. It used to start (usually after 3-4 tries since i havent finished the engine mapping), but after I tidied up the wiring harness with some sleeving and let the car sit for a few weeks(without checking if the car started after it I'm a dumbass), it just refuses to start now.  
Here is what I checked 

\- Cranks fine.  
\- Fuel pressure shows up at prime  
\- Pump primes on key-on but doesn’t run while cranking.  
\- Pump works fine if I give it 12 V directly.  
\- It fires with starter fluid (so spark/ignition is good).  
\- ECU sees engine rotation (trigger signal is there).  
  
Just to be sure I refurbished starter, putted a new battery, changed for fresh ethanol fuel and tested the pump relay and wiring. For me the problem could be the Injectors stuck (sat with ethanol for a while). or injectors not getting 12 V or not being commanded by ECU (maybe something happened when I re-loomed the harness).

Anyone seen this before on VEMS/4AGE setups? Pump only primes, car fires on starter fluid but won’t run on fuel. Would love to hear what you’d check next.

I'm also exploring head gasket sealer which comes with its own complete set of issues. I've also had mechanics flat out refuse to touch subarus. 

I've got a brand new water pump waiting to be put in after main problem gets resolved (and I know water pump is bad too). I've got oil in my coolant, oil on dipstick actually looks great but I've heard that you can't always tell by just that.

1nxzmnf,Constant loud squeal + hard-start issue — 2018 Chevy Trax LT AWD (1.4-L Turbo),"
Hello everyone 👋

I’m hoping for some advice or direction.

I’ve been over-charged by shops in the past, so I’m cautious about taking my car straight in without understanding what could be wrong. I’d like to have an idea first so I can plan for repairs and costs.

I’m a single mom, so budgeting matters... I just need to know where to start.

Car details:

• 2018 Chevrolet Trax LT AWD – 1.4-L Ecotec Turbo, 6-speed automatic

• 21,350 miles

• Regular oil changes, no check-engine light on


Current problems:

• Persistent high-pitched squeaking / squealing from the engine area.

• Originally appeared 6 months only after ~1 hr of driving; now it’s constant from startup and loud enough that people outside the car notice.

• Noise gets louder when I press the gas, but will continue even when parked

• No visible leaks or parts hanging underneath. 

• Two mechanically-savvy relatives inspected it and said they’d never heard a noise quite like this and can't see any issues by quick glance 


Starting issue:

• Sometimes it has a hard start — I press the push-start button and it cranks longer than normal before the engine fires up.

• Occasionally it fails to start on the first attempt but starts on the second.

• Previous diagnostic scans at shops didn’t show any codes.


Any ideas about what might be going on or what I should ask a mechanic to check first? I’d appreciate any help!

I’ve got a 2008 Dodge Avenger with the 2.4L engine. I’ve been chasing an issue where an oil-like substance keeps ending up in the throttle body. I’ve already fixed the PCV valve and replaced the valve cover, so those shouldn’t be the problem.

The throttle body keeps getting gunked up with oily residue, which causes rough idling and poor throttle response until I clean it again. After a while, it comes right back.

Here’s what’s going on:
	•	PCV valve and valve cover have both been replaced
	•	Air filter and intake are clean
	•	Oil level is fine, no visible leaks
	•	Check engine light is on (I haven’t scanned it yet but plan to)

It seems like something is still letting oil or some kind of fluid get pulled through the intake, but I’m out of ideas at this point.

Another source of material going into the intake is the Exhaust Gas Recirculation. Does the EGR return exhaust to before the throttle body or after? Again you could be burning tiny amounts of oil and they find their way back into the intake.

Does it sound normal when cranking? Or does it crank a lot faster and more smooth than normal?

In the last case, you could have a broken timing belt (if the internet wasn't lying to me, you have a belt). Any history of replacement of that belt?

Also, in that case I would expect the engine to have given a noticable jerk (and potentially multiple) at breaking time.



Alternative, it the belt is still in one piece, could simply be a camshaft timing sensor. Without it, you lose ignition. So it won't do anything anymore. That could be a cheap fix if it's just the sensor."

The wires need to ""engage"" the spark plug terminal. You should hear or feel a distinct ""click"" when installed correctly. If left loose, may form a temporary connection  but the resistance will be high and can lead to the plugs and wires being damaged. You can also have spark leak which will also destroy them.

1nxtvs4,Is my drive axle nut socket too short ?,"Hi everyone, I'm trying to change my CV boot, but it seems that my socket is just a bit too short to fit the nut. 

It's not loose when I move it in circular motion so it seems to be the right size, but is very wobbly as if it was not fully in contact with the nut

I tried to put some copper grease and it seems to touch the bottom of the socket. So I guess it's too short and that's why it's not in contact with the nut correctly ?

Hi, After a long downhill drive where I had to use my brakes quite a bit because of the long gradual slope downwards, I started hearing a continuous squealing sound from my car.

I opened the window to hear it better and also recorded it with my phone (Hear attached video, the wind noise is quite loud obviously, but you can hear the continuous squealing sound too - the recording is for 15 seconds only. In real life the squealing sound was also quite loud).

I decided to exit and while slowing down I noticed every time I braked to slow down for the exit, the squealing sound would stop while braking but immediately resume once the brakes were released.

Once the car was stopped, I noticed the hub cap of one of my tires was really hot!. After letting the car cool down for 1/2 an hour, I resumed driving and then there was no noise at all.

A month later I had the same experience but with another wheel this time, but what's funny is I was not going downhill then, just flat roads.

* Squeaking noise from front left area
* Noise **disappears completely when I apply brakes**
* Noise **changes when I turn the steering wheel**

This past Monday my tire pressure went low again, brought it to Les Schwab, they filled the tires said it was probably the cold and sent me on my way. Tire pressure light went off within about a minute and I was good to go.

Now it did get cold really fast where I live. I mean we went from 70s-low 80s down to 60s-high 50s within about a week which I know can cause a drop and that’s why I wasn’t very concerned at first. But the temperature has remained fairly consistent this week and last night the light came on again and remained on today on my way to work. The tires don’t feel too bad and they got me to work but I know they need air. 

The tires are also nearly brand new as I just bought them last December and have about 12k miles on them and they should be good for 70k. I’m getting regular rotations and all that. During all of my tire checks and car inspections during that time no one has ever pointed out anything to be concerned about with my tires but I’m not so sure right now.

After I get off I’m going to take it to Les Schwab as there is one about 5 minutes from my work and they’ll fill my tires for free and I’m also hoping I can get them to give it a check. How worried should I be that I have a leak?

Most newer cars allow you to get the actual psi from the dash. If not, check it with a gauge. You should confirm readings with a gauge anyway. Some TPMS systems can take time or distance to update the reading. 

Old school rule of thumb is that you will lose 1 psi for every ( edit: 10 degrees) Fahrenheit. Tires should be filled/checked cold and adjusted seasonally. Tires get hot when you drive so psi will go up.

I'm going to guess it's the starter since you just installed it and I could hear it (among other things) in the video. When you turn the key, your starter engages - sounds like a chug chug cranking kind of sound with teeth(when it works well...otherwise just grindy toothy when broken) . It goes around trying to crank your car manually. This sounds changes with the temperature as really cold days sometimes don't make for great starting conditions in the motor and a bit of charging helps it going. Oil is moved around during this motion as well, getting things ready. This would explain, since it's getting colder, why initially it's a bit louder/slower but when your car is warm it's like an instant/quicker start.


Otherwise none of your car sounds jump out as bad to me."
1nxljy9,25/F Looking for reliable family car but no idea where to start,"Hey everyone, I could really use some guidance.

When I first got my license, I drove a manual 2012 Kia Rio SLS and really liked it. After 6 years of driving, I gave the car to my partner and stopped driving for a while due to a medication I was on that didn’t allow me to drive. Fast forward 2 years, I’m now pregnant and on safer meds, so it’s time to get back behind the wheel and find a car that’ll actually suit my lifestyle now.

The Kia Rio is way too small for a pram and car seat and I’d like something more practical and reliable for a family. Thing is… I have no idea where to even begin. Reliability, functionality, what to look for when buying used… I’m lost.

My situation:

-I don’t have a large budget and I can’t finance a brand new car.

-Right now I’ve got $6k saved, but I plan to have at least $10k. I am willing to finance the difference if it’s a small amount (up to 10k extra).

-Needs to fit a pram & car seat.

-I’d love something that’s not a money pit!! Reliable, fuel efficient, low-maintenance.

-Aesthetics matter a little, but practicality and long term reliability are way more important.

-Not sure whether I should look private sale or through a dealer.

So I guess the questions I have are:

-What cars should I even be looking at in this price range?

-What are red flags to look out for when buying a used car (kms, year models, etc)?

-Any tips for negotiating or deciding between private vs car yard?

I’m just a girl with zero car knowledge trying to find something that won’t let me down when I’ve got a baby in the back seat, so any advice, recommendations, or tips would be super appreciated.

It’s so handy for when you have to change nappies!  Even if it’s raining.

Sedans, hatch backs & vans aren’t as good because you don’t get that flat space in the boot to lie them down where you can still easily reach.  

Dual cab Utes are also an option but can be rudimentary on features & suck trying to load/unload in the rain.  Not all have lockable trays either meaning anything you put in the back can get stolen.

They don’t stay babies for long, so look favourably on anything that will let them watch videos in the back.

As for brands, Toyota seem to have a great reputation for reliability.  Maintenance costs are much lower than the European cars.  Jury is still out imo on the Chinese brands even though they are cheaper again.

Look for low kilometres, & any signs of it having a hard life.  Ask for the history of the car, like who owned it previously, why did they sell.  Check all the panels for straightness eg are the gaps between doors all the same width, do adjacent panels align, are there any dents, do the lights seem like matching pairs.

Check it’s got log books.

Make sure it’s got no outstanding debts on it from the previous owner/s.

If you go to a dealership a lot of this should be taken care of but isn’t always certain.  Private can be cheaper but do your homework.

Once you settle on a model, look at forums online to see owner feedback.  Look at more than a few to get to know how they are supposed to look before you start narrowing down on one or two you really like.

I’d also suggest looking for something with an engine that does not need to rev high.  Turbos are just another thing to go wrong.  Imo anything less than 3 litres capacity is asking for trouble.

The shop I work at in NC is very well respected. We’ve been around close to 20 years and have a great reputation (basically 5.0 stars rating on Google with thousands of customer reviews). I’m looking for some feedback on compensation for techs to see if there’s something we’re missing.

We’re currently looking for an European tech that has expertise in Mercedes. We’re having trouble and I’m kind of surprised, I feel like our pay is very competitive. Pay is 45/hr and you’re guaranteed 40 hours of pay each week, no matter what. Anything above 40 is paid as a flat rate of 45/hr. They would be “the” guy for Mercedes and have two bays to run, so their upside is huge. We have a BMW and an Audi/VW tech, both who have been here well over 10 years. They average at least 250 hours a month, often more, and are pulling down 130-150K a year. They’re great at what they do and often wrap at lunch on Fridays. No weekend work. Family owned shop that doesn’t sweat them at all, they’re super appreciated. 

This seems like a really solid comp plan compared to most, yet I’m often surprised how many dealership techs just aren’t interested. What am I missing? Are folks just skeptical of independent shops? What are dealerships offering that I’m missing?

I lived just NW of Chicago and yeah, the snow was terrible every year. My Dad had a 58 Corvette but it only saw the road 5 months out of the year. It lived in the garage all winter long.

So, nice sports cars are probably out of the question. You want a daily driver and something that will handle well in those winter months. AWD you mentioned would be a great idea for sure. My only AWD has been my 90 GMC Pickup truck with a 350 engine that's bored .60 over. It's terrible on gas! I get maybe 9 MPG. I hardly drive the thing because it costs me $100 to fill it up. I can't use the cheap stuff in it. It has to be Premium gasoline. I can't sell this gas pig either. So it sits most of the time now.

So, what to take from that, get something that gets great gas mileage. Gas is probably going to shoot back up after Trump is out of office if not sooner. $3 gasoline is here to stay I'm afraid. So, something that gets 28-34MPG is a great find if you can find something like that. If you can drive a manual transmission, that'll get you the cheapest gas for sure. I have a little 5 speed (needs some engine work) and it will get 32MPG on a bad day. It's got a 10 gallon tank but I can usually get 350+ miles on that tank easily... when the engine is running good. I really need to get it in the shop and get it running again. 

But keep in mind fuel economy. You'll thank yourself later when fuel ifs $5-$6 a gallon in a few years.

Apologies before hand it’s my first car, and I’m actively trying to learn more, so there’s a lot I don’t understand.

When it doesn’t I use a battery jumper just a pocket sizes craftsman jumper and it takes a few attempts it usually looks like it tries to starts but battery cuts out before it can, it doesn’t have any problems when it is running but as soon as I take the key out the car goes dead.

My spouse came and jumped the car off with zero issues. The battery was last changed in 2020, so I figured it was time. I purchased a new battery and every thing has been find since then.
The *only* thing different is that in the last few weeks the car has sometimes felt maybe slightly off to start - almost hesitant or sluggish. Not even enough that someone else would notice it. Honestly, its so slight i could be over thinking it. I only notice because I drive it daily and I love the car.

chensium (Score: 3): Your dad is being confusing for some reason.  No need to be pedantic here.


It's simple.  FWD means power goes to the front.  This basically just means you can steer and accelerate at the same time.  If you care about slippery road conditions like rain/ice/mud you will need Limited Slip Diff, Locking Diff or Traction Control.  They work in different ways but all will deliver power to the wheel that's not slipping.

SandstoneCastle (Score: 2): Your dad is wrong. That's a common misconception which arises from the fact that when you're stuck only one wheel will spin.

An open differential essentially gives you a 50/50 torque split between the two wheels. Which is great when they both have grip. But when you're stuck in the mud with one wheel spinning, little torque is applied to either.

The fact that they both get half the torque makes you much less likely to get stuck than if only one side was powered. More likely though than if you could lock the differential or if you had a limited slip differential.

Has nothing to do with the engine orientation."

1ny86qv,"Why would my car suddenly stop starting after 2 hours of errands, then start after sitting for a half-hour?","My car, a 2012 Nissan Versa, has done this twice now, last Saturday and today.

Both days, I drove to the food bank, then did a couple of other errands around town.

Last week, I drove home to pick up my husband, and while the car was idling it suddenly started running rough. I turned it off, waited a couple minutes, and tried to start it. A half-dozen times it would catch briefly and then immediately die. If we got 5 seconds out of it wavering, I'd try to put it in gear and it would die immediately.

We pushed it into a space and the next day a friend came over to help check the spark plugs. He tinkered briefly--he says he really did nothing that might have changed things--and then suggested we try starting it to see what happens.

And it started fine, they took it on a test drive with no issues! We drove all week.  We took our kiddo to school, and to therapy an hour away, and it was all fine.  I even had a day with an hour and 15 minutes of errands in close proximity (I recall distinctly because I was expecting to have to cut one or two in order to pick up my child from school on time, but I had amazing luck and fit it all in) with no trouble.

Today was the same as last Saturday--food bank, then a couple hours of errands. Then I topped off the tank and went to start the car to leave the gas pump. It did this start-and-die routine 5 or 6 times till I got the hint and gave up.

I got help pushing the car into a parking spot and set a timer for half an hour.  I figured after that I would call AAA, but maybe it just needed to sit? Given what happened last time.

And that worked! (WHY?!) Half an hour later I started the car and drove home without incident.

Last week our friend thought it was probably something like the fuel pump or the cam positioning sensor. Could this still be the case? Is it likely to be something else? Can we keep on this way until we save up money for a repair? Is the problem likely to worsen?

Decided to try a salvage yard for some body damage, found 2 doors and got them swapped over but now im stuck with the old damaged doors. According to the city, dumpster bins aren't supposed to be used for auto parts, but they also say that they don't pick up auto parts through bulky trash pickup. 

I found some dumps and recycling centers but that seems like a weird choice cause the dump charges per ton and the doors are probably 150 lbs total. And dumps didn't explicitly say no auto parts but they did say no electronic waste... so if I take the wiring and window motor out does that make the part not electronic waste? And I think recycling centers are trying to buy scrap material from me... but I just want to get rid of these doors ASAP. 

It seems like the common thing is to just put fenders and stuff in a random alley for some good ol' illegal dumping, which I'm not in favor of, but I'm not finding an option that makes sense.

I also figure that the door has the VIN so it could be tracked, but that's just a sticker that can be removed. But I'm more interested in doing the proper disposal method. Does anyone know if I could pay a body shop to take them off my hands? Or does the recycling center/ dump make the most sense and that's just the cost of diy?

If it's a major leak (i.e. having to add oil daily)  then it needs to be fixed as soon as possible. If it's a minor leak then tou have the luxury of trying to diagnose it yourself and determine if its worth the hassle to fix. You can put some dye specifically designed for oil ij the engine to see where its coming from. Some oil fixes are easy DIY projects and some will require removal of other parts.  That said, generally, most, but not all, oil leaks are fixable and not typically a reason to get rid of a car by themselves."

billmr606 (Score: 17): kids today, so lazy

there are lots of reasons why this might not be desirable,

Parking brakes should be very simple, reliable mechanisms, not reliant on any other systems in the car to be applied or removed. For a long time the best way to accomplish this was with a steel cable linkage and ratcheting hold mechanism, which is basically unchanged from the designs used in cars of the 1920s or even earlier.

In the last 10 years or so, car makers have developed electric actuators that pull on that cable for you at the push of a button. This is apparently deemed advantageous even though it adds weight and cost, because it gives more flexibility in the interior layout. However, even then there has to be an additional mechanism to release the parking brake in the case that the car’s battery is totally disconnected, which adds even more complexity.

if your battery is dead or your car computer goes wonky things would be difficult.

it would make replacing rear brakes a pita

So not explicitly off-roading or over landing, but an all terrain, weather capable more aggressive treads.

My SUV currently has OEM 22"" rims, with 285/45R22 tires.

Personally, I think the rubber-to-wheel ratio is too low in this set up. basically all rim, 1-2"" of rubber tire. Just doesn't feel right having so little sidewall or air, esp on the loss gravel, pot hole having access roads we have to drive on to & fro our house. So, psychologically, my instinct is to drop rim size to something like 18-20""....

however, there are some tire options that could fit on current 22""s.  BFG Trail Terrain, Nitto Terra Grabbler G3, TOYO OPEN COUNTRY A/T III, MICHELIN DEFENDER LTX M/S2etc...

so, what would you do in this situation?

1.	⁠keep 22"" rims, throw one of the all season options above?
2.	⁠downside rims (what size would you do, why?), throw new all seasons

Have decades of offroad/overlanding adventure experience, and something about having more rim than rubber just doesn't sit right with me - is it all in my head??

If most your driving is off paved roads and ""light"" all-terrain driving in all conditions, I would absolutely downsize the rims. Increasing sidewall weight not only decreases road noise and increases ride comfort, it reduces the likelihood of damage from external forces and gives better performance in adverse driving conditions. I would also probably go narrower... 285 is pretty wide tire, especially for winter use.

wpmason (Score: 1): 285/45R22s have 5” sidewalls.

That may not be as much as you want, but math is math and you’re straight up lying about the numbers. Don’t do that. 

The biggest issue with low profile tires is that they just don’t flex. The sidewalls are incredibly stiff. That leads to a stiffer ride on the street, but also worse traction off road, and you completely forfeit the ability to air down for better grip. 

The rim is also more vulnerable to impact damage (potholes, curb hits, etc) since the stiff sidewalls don’t soak up as much energy, they transfer a fair amount of it. 

If you wanted to move to 18” wheels, you’d need either a 285/65R18 or 285/60R18 to be close to the same size. (One is 1/2 inch taller, the other is 1/2 inch shorter). Those would give about 7” of sidewall instead of 5”.

If you actually wanted “more rubber than rim” on a 32” tall tire, you’d have to get 16” wheels or smaller which I wouldn’t recommend because tire manufacturers are supporting those sizes less and less and larger wheels are so common. 

As for the pro’s, you get a little more bounce and flex, you can air down some, but the sidewalls are more susceptible to damage and blowouts. 

Now, I’d never recommend hardcore off roading with 20” or larger rims, but that includes rock crawling, which you did not mention in your usage description. 

It’s a massive investment, so perhaps consider trying out one of those quality AT tires on your 22s and actually assess their performance. Then decide if you want to change wheels… you can get some money back on lightly used tires, and also sell your OEM wheels to offset the costs. 

Wheel fitment is one of those things that you have to go deep into the geometry of everything though… backspacing is crucial, how big are your brakes, since they’ll dictate just how small the wheel can be…. There’s a fair amount to consider here.

And driving on gravel/dirt isn’t exactly hardcore off roading. You definitely want the best traction you can get, but you don’t need the ability to air down to 10psi to crawl over razor sharp rocks either."

Evacuate the refrigerant, compare how much I evacuate compared to what ""full"" is for the system, vacuum for 15 minutes and see the value as well as see if it can even hold vacuum for a certain duration. Then, prior to charging the system, I inject UV dye into the system.

  
Charge the system, confirm proper operation. If not properly operating, then either charge more diag time or continue diagnosis depending on the situation. 

  
It's hard to check if the compressor is working without refrigerant. You can apply voltage to the component and monitor the clutch, see if that's engaging/disengaging.. but it's also unknown if the pressure switch is also operational.. it's also unknown if there are leaks in the system.

Anyway my question to you guys would be , when someone is buying a car hypothetically. I’ve noticed if it’s of lower value it’s pretty much always cash purchased and I’m aware value is entirely personal.

What I’ve also more interestingly noticed is when people are buying _expensive_ cars which to me is anything more than 10k but realistically we’re talking Porsches, Astons, nice m cars, the top 1% of factory performance models. They always seem to be purchased either PCP or on lease. I never see anyone cash buying said models unless they fully intend on putting 250k miles on them and running them till the wheels fall off . 

What could be the reasoning on this, also it clearly isn’t a money issue because to be accepted on such deals takes £££ anyway . Are they gauging the market and seeing if they appreciate or depreciate? Is there a trick us regulars are missing here

Cars universally depreciate and the more expensive they are initially, the quicker that happens - luxury sports cars have an entirely different depreciation curve compared to your average 3 series or Octavia. People who buy expensive cars buy them often, they don't intend on keeping them forever - 12/24/36 months later they're onto the next best thing, they're not dream cars or goals to them, they're just another accessory.

Combine the above, and finance just makes sense - especially in conjunction with all-in deals where routine servicing is rolled up into the monthly cost. Meanwhile even if they have the lump sum available, it's stashed in some index fund making 3-10% a year tax free and practically paying off the lease whilst they sleep - they get to cut about in a brand new car whilst their principle sum is untouched and still growing.

1ny3dmd,Costs of ownership after 1 year with my first car (C7.5 A6 Avant),"Costs of ownership after 1 year with my first car (C7.5 A6 Avant)

TLDR: £2,647

Hi all, after 1 year with my 2015 Audi A6 Avant, I wanted to share my experiences with it. I intend on this being a bit of an informational piece, but im also doing this out of curiosity to see where my money went.. I’m absolutely loving having a car I can call my own, which confirms to me that the most enjoyable car for you is probably one you take care of and enjoy using.

Costs:

1. Insurance: I paid £1387 to insure it this year. For reference, I’m in my early twenties (M) with no NCD (at the time) or incidents and live in a city up north. Turns out putting both my parents as named drivers on the policy made it cheaper (???) which I definitely took advantage of. Hoping this should come down with age and compounding NCD.

1. Fuel: I travelled 5,952 miles this year and averaged 54.8mpg doing pretty much only motorway driving, resulting in £753 in fuel spend. It stings at the pump with such a large tank, but the car regularly gets 750-800miles from a fill up so trips to the pumps are few and far between. I’ve had to top up the AdBlue 3 times but it has been free thanks to my dad who gets it from work.

1. Maintenance: This year is probably higher than what I would consider normal, but I still think it's an accurate reflection of what upkeep could look like. 

* Tyres: I replaced all 4 tyres for Michelin Primacy 5’s + tracking for £740. The car was running Hankook Kinergy 4S2’s which is a decent all season tire but unfortunately they just didn't have the tread left. The Michelin’s are a brilliant set of tires which I defo recommend if most of your miles consist of motorway cruising.
* Maintenance: I spent £220 diagnosing and fixing a faulty air pressure sensor which was putting the car into limp mode. I also had a minor service which consists of an oil change, air and oil filters, and an inspection from the local mobile mechanic for £230.

1. Tax + MOT: I spent £35 on Taxing the car this year and £35 for the MOT at the local specialist (mates rates). £70 total.

So £2,647 all in. If youve got any questions about the costs or the car, lmk!

He only has around £2500 to spend and wants something cheap and economical. His research has led him to a Peugeot 107, which would suit his budget, both to buy and the monthly running costs and insurance. He has looked at a few, but has found one in his ideal colour. It has full service history and very good mileage, a good spec and seems well looked after.

The only problem is that one of the front wing panels has some bubbling and what looks like rust developing...

We've spent hours googling and we just don't know what to think. Some people say to avoid at all costs no matter how little rust. Some say we can get it repaired and not to worry so much about rust on body panels.

We are happy to pay to repair it, but not too sure what it would cost. We're worried it could be a sign of something more untoward...

It's just had an DPF clean, I did all brakes 18 months ago. Cambelt is due soon and I think it needs a new clutch. I've not had any issues with it generally. I suppose it will need a new battery too soon. I have just finished the finance on it and it's great for fuel with no tax. 

I don't have loads of savings. If I was to change it I would have about £1k for a deposit (plus I suppose whatever I'd get for my current car - it has a lot of dents - We Buy Any Car value at £1.8k before looking at it). I could afford about £300 a month for the finance of a new car. 

I'm not fussy on the new car but it'd need to be able to handle the mileage and be decent on fuel. A reliable engine.

They’re wrong. That piece is shaped exactly as it’s intended to be. The issue is with one of your brake calipers on the rear. There’s a lever on the back of the caliper which that cable pulls to engage the handbrake. It’s very common for that lever to not fully return, and over time it gets stuck more and more until there’s no travel left to engage the handbrake. 

Sometimes you can free it off and get it working again. But calipers for these are extremely cheap and not worth the time involved for freeing it off.

Cremboyy (Score: 2): It's normal to have a slight imbalance, however this is quite bad obviously. I had the same issue on my 2009 Seat Ibiza (identical to yours). With the handbrake applied the right rear wheel was holding properly, but the left rear wheel would spin (checked this by jacking the rear of the car up and spinning the wheels). 

Thought it was a handbrake cable issue at first, but it turned out to be a seized/sticky handbrake lever on the caliper. I've attached the photos in a link at the bottom as this sub doesn't let me upload photos. As you can see, the bad caliper has a large gap between the lever and stop bar (circled red). A properly functioning handbrake should have little to no gap, like the green circled photo.

If you look under your car, do either of your rear calipers look similar to the bad caliper photo I sent?

I sprayed the seized lever bushing with WD40 and moved it back and forth to free it up, the handbrake then started working and it passed an MOT without an issue, however this is a temp fix so I wouldn't recommend it. 

So pretty much to diagnose, check if your caliper level has a gap. If it does, free it and check if the handbrake works. Very likely you'll need a new caliper or handbrake cable. Best of luck.

And don't go to Halfords, go to a well known independent garage instead.

1nxr9wq,"First car advice – budget £10–12k, low mileage use","Hi all,

I just got my licence and I’m on the hunt for a used car in the £10–12k range (could stretch a little if needed). I won’t be commuting in it — mostly short drives (gym, errands) and occasional weekend trips. No kids, and I expect to drive no more than \~6k miles per year.

**Priorities:**

* Reliability and low maintenance
* Automatic preferred (but not a dealbreaker)
* Decent looks / performance
* Ideally 2018/2019 or newer, and under 60k miles (I worry older/higher-mileage cars might start giving issues in a few years)

I’ve been looking at the Toyota Yaris and Corolla, but 2018–2019 automatics with \~50–60k miles seem to be around £13k+, which feels steep. At the same time, I see some Mercedes C-Class models around £13k at approved dealers — which surprised me. I assume those would be more expensive to run/maintain, but I’m not sure how much more.

**So two main questions:**

1. **What car should I buy?** Besides Yaris/Corolla, what models hit a good balance between cheap runabouts and luxury brands? Some I’m considering (but don’t know much about):
   * Mazda 3 / Mazda CX-3
   * Honda Civic or Jazz
   * Hyundai i30 / Kona
   * Kia Ceed / Niro
   * VW Golf / Polo
   * Possibly a lower-mileage Mercedes or BMW if history/condition checks out?
2. **Where should I buy from?** I’ve read many stories about independent dealers selling cars that develop faults quickly and not supporting customers. That makes me lean toward manufacturer-approved dealers (Toyota, Mazda, etc.), even if it costs more. Is that the smart move, or am I being too cautious?

1nxo1th,Auto brake release unreliable in VW,"Posted this over in AskMechanics but I didn't get any replies. Hopefully I have more luck here!

I'm having a very frustrating problem with my 67 plate Touran, where the automatic brake release will not work properly for a few days, then will work perfectly for a few weeks, and then start playing up again. There doesn't seem to be any pattern to it. 

It's a manual, with an e-brake. When I bring up the clutch and try and pull away, the car will strain as the clutch bites but the brakes will not release. This happens when the car is held by both the e-brake and the auto-hold function. Sometimes if I apply more power it will release after a moment. Sometimes if I press the clutch down and then bring it up again it will release as it should, other times it won't even with quite a lot of power applied and I'll have to press the brake release button. What concerns me really is that one day the brake won't release when I press the button, and I'll be stuck. 

I've taken it to a couple of garages, but naturally it works fine on days when I take it in and they have said no faults are logged in the system so they can't say where the problem is.

I've trawled the internet about this, and came across various threads from people with other VW group cars of similar age having this issue. Someone suggested changing the battery, which I did, and it worked perfectly for a month or so but has now started happening again. Other people reported that their garage changed the clutch position sensors and that fixed it for some time, but then they posted a few months later that it had happened again.

The thing all these brief 'fixes' have in common is the system is fully reset because the battery is disconnected (I assume you have to disconnect the battery to change any sensors?). From this, and given the randomness of it occuring, it seems very much like a software problem to me, but when I rang the local dealership they took my reg and then told me my software is all up to date.

I have it booked in to a VW specialist next week, but I'm expecting it will be on its best behaviour again.

I basically have three questions:

1. Has anyone ever come across this?

2. Can a garage realistically diagnose this kind of intermittent problem if it's not happening at the time they look at it?

3. Is there a realistic chance of me being unable to release the brake manually at some point?",1,1759564651.0,16,CartalkUK,1759692693,2025-10-04 07:57:31,2025-10-05 19:31:33,"Investigator-Prize (Score: 2): Hope I’m not being insulting but are you applying the throttle?

I’ve been looking for a second-hand Toyota Yaris in London, but even older models (around 2015) seem to cost about £5.5k or more.

Are there any other brands or models that are cheaper but still reliable , cheap to run and good for city driving? I’m open to small cars that are easy to park, have low running costs, and are known for being dependable.

For context, I got my driving licence more than 10 years ago in a country that drives on the opposite side of the road, and I haven’t driven much since then. So I’m looking for something easy to handle, reliable, and affordable to insure and maintain while I get used to driving in the UK again.

I have a driveway, so parking isn’t an issue.

Also — roughly how much should I budget for the first year of ownership (excluding the purchase price)? I’m thinking about insurance, road tax, MOT, servicing, fuel, parking, etc., but I’d love to hear what others actually spend in London.

Any recommendations or advice would be really appreciated — especially from anyone who recently bought a used car here.
