1n8pavg,Weird misfire!,"I have a very weird intermittent misfire that happens on my 2012 Civic Coupe (currently at \~230,000 miles) , which has been there since I bought the car 4 years ago. ( Approximately 0-10 in 20 miles ) The other day I drove around 200 miles and had 20 misfires in total.

I don't hear or feel the misfires at all, and it runs absolutely fine with no check engine light. But I've tried to diagnose it to the best of my ability, because it's kind of an OCD as I think the misfires should be 0.

My first guess was the sparkplugs and ignition coils , so I changed them just in case ( denso ignition coils and ngk ruthenium hx sparkplugs). I've attached the picture of my old sparkplugs ( used for approx 55,000 miles ) and they don't look half bad to me , and I have no oil burning issues, which I have noticed in the oil changes that I do every 5000 miles.

I recorded so data with my OBD scanner ( anyscan a30) and saw that the MAP and the MAF was had some weird data . Then I noticed that the misfires were happening when I accelerate , then let go of the gas , and when the rpms are falling , accelerate again . In this scenario according to the data , I thought that my maf was falling behind -> throttle pressed , map read 90 , MAF read 40 ish , and then throttle not-pressed, map read 26, MAF still read 30 ish. I gave this info to Gemini and it thought I need to clean the MAF sensor , which sounded reasonable.

So I cleaned my maf sensor with CRC MAF cleaner. It did help , the misfires got reduced ( may be 1 or 2 ) . This wasent very conclusive , so I replaced the sensor with a Hitachi sensor yesterday, and still the same. It still misfires .

Do I have a compression issue ? A faulty fuel pump ? A vaccum leak ? Clogged cat ?

I checked the pipes and vaccum lines , visually they seemed fine. I've used fuel system cleaner additives too (a few bottles of gumout ) with no effect.

I'm not sure on how to proceed next. It's not causing any issues , but I just want to figure out what's going on .

Additional information -

1. I got a valve adjustment done around 30,000 ago at the dealership.
2. I'm fairly handy with tools , but am scared to open the valve cover and under.
3. Any suggestions will be helpful .

1n8ol1f,How do I get a mechanic to actually diagnose my car?,"Sounds like a stupid question but usually when I get a car fixed I just go to my mechanic and say “hey I need X done”. The last time I took a car to a shop for diag was when I couldn’t figure out a check engine light code for my civic. It was an EGR code so I took the EGR valve off to check for a clog and stuck a screw driver down there, couldn’t find anything. This shop charges me like $200 for “electrical diag”, literally just plug a scanner in and then they tell me “yeah we took the egr valve off and put a pole in to check for clogs and didn’t see anything, the next step would be to take the throttle body off and check that” The next step was another diag charge. 

When you get diag done is it just common practice to bone people for no reason? I get paying for time and expertise but if you’re just gonna scan the code, get the same code I got at auto zone and then charge me id rather not.

Your problem is very likely to be the DEF dosing module (""computer""). It's giving a lot of troubles on recent Renault and the problem keeps on appearing even on brand new vans. If your country requires no emission inspections or is less rigind than us on the matter consider having the DEF system deleted: it's about the only reliable cure to this problem."

Took it in because it was hard shifting or having a little lag when accelerating after a cold start. Mostly when shifting from 1st or 2nd into the higher gears. If the truck warms up then there is no issue. I would assume it has a chance to heat the transmission fluid and makes it more lubricated but I'm no car person. Anyways. The dealership said I need to replace transmission for $8500. States it has metal shavings in the fluid and some of the fluid gets burnt. To me, this sounds serious enough to replace it. I've called around and some people have suggested rebuilding the transmission instead of replacing in order to save money (save ~$1500-$2000). Anyone have any advice. I would really like to not spend that amount of money. Is that even a normal amount to pay? I initially told them that was too much so I will check around and they asked what was the max price that I would pay and I don't even know what a realistic number to give them. A couple other local shops want to run their own diag (free of charge) to see the problem.

I had to re-pull the head because I incorrectly sealed between the block, head, and timing chain cover. Easy fix, although I noticed an oddly large difference in the amount of carbon buildup on the pistons. All pistons are the originals, which were cleaned by hand during the rebuild. 

My question is, why do the front and rear pistons show more buildup than the middle pistons? The front is the worst, but the rear still has some buildup. Intake ports are all clean, as well as no other discernable differences between cylinders anywhere else on or in the engine. 

I have been doing a considerable amount of highway driving over the last 5k miles, and rpms were sustained at 2600-3100 for much of that. I do typically drive like a grandpa, so rpms rarely see above 4k. 

What could be causing the buildup? Injectors and spark plugs are on my list to replace, although they all seem to be working perfectly fine. My prime suspect is the thermostat, which was replaced during the rebuild. If faulty, it may be causing the engine to run slightly cooler, thus causing buildup on the cooler cylinders. The temp gauge is not overly accurate, although my gut tells me it has been reading a fraction of a hair lower than it did before the rebuild, at least at highway speeds. I could be wrong and misremembering, but just an observation.

Recently (3 weeks ago) my 2011 Honda Pilot (190k Miles) alternator went out - got it done pretty immediately. Light came on and took it in the next day. 

Fast forward to about a week later and something is off. My “Check Battery Charging System” light keeps flashing on for a millisecond before disappearing. Will happen randomly throughout the week sometimes multiple times a day without pattern. Sometimes I’m idle at a light - sometimes I’m driving 35 or 55 - or I’m making a turn - it’s just random and quick before turning off. Never had an issue with it before so it’s funny that it’s come up right after getting a fix.

Took it to auto zone to get a battery/alternator test - all came back normal. Kept happening - took it to mechanic that I got the work done at - he says there’s nothing wrong and i relatively trust him and he’s done work before on my car that’s been trustworthy. 

Not sure what the issue could be - or if it’s flashing for a soon to come issue? Is it electrical going haywire after a fix? Should I just go ahead and replace my battery (haven’t at all since buying the car 3 years ago) and see if that works??

Rotors on newer vehicles are often manufactured to already be close to the minimum thickness specification, which means they can't usually be machined. It's all about reducing total vehicle weight to meet fuel economy standards, even when it's only an ounce or two.

Another consideration is that the cost of labor to machine rotors is close to the price of new, common rotors for the average commuter vehicle.

As for the wheel hub, for your car the bearing and hub comes as a unit.  There's no practical way to replace the bearing separately.

Got it home drove for a few days putting about 300 miles on it and pulled the codes.  


P0128 coolant thermostat (coolant temperature below regulating temperature. This one i don't believe cause ours reading 203 degrees on the dash after warming up and verified with infrared thermometer. Possibly faulty sensor. Gonna ignore it for now but watch the temp reading to see how it behaves.  


Secondary dtcs
PO300 random multiple misfire
PO302 cylinder 2 misfire. 
PO302 (again) cylinder 2 misfire.  

So my code reader says 3 possible solutions. 

1. Phenom gasket. What the hell is this? A quick Google looks like it's just another word for an intake manifold gasket. Is that right? Cause that's no big deal.  I've changed hundreds of intake gaskets on big engines and dozens on old v8 Chevy and Fords. 

2. Replace coil packs. Again no big deal.  But any reason I should change all 6 and not just number 2?

3.  Spark plugs.  Planned on this anyway when I change the oil and transmission fluid/filter when I get time.  

The symptoms are if I just jump in it and turn the key oit cranks but doesn't fire. If I wait about 3 seconds for the dash to fully cycle it fires up and revs a little higher than I expect. About 1500 rpms for 15 to 30 seconds before settlling back down to right at 1k. 

While driving in the upper gear shifts it kind of stumbles a bit.  But if I shift manually it is smooth as silk.  I would suspect a transmission ecu but it didn't give any transmission related codes. Hoping this is related to the engine miss.   It's hard to be certain tho. 

Every once in a while it does miss while idling.  But it's not consistent at all. 

So the plan is plugs, and number 2 coil unless you guys can convince me to do all 6 coils. See if that clears things up before doing the phenom (intake) gasket. 

Anything else you guys can think of that might be causing the miss and stumble at shift? 

Couple other minor issues but I'll deal with them after getting it running right.  

1. The sliding doors don't work from the buttons (key fob, driver buttons above the windshield and buttons at the door s themselves).  Got to open them manually.  No big deal but would be nice to be able to open and close from the buttons cause those doors are heavy and kits like to slam them instead of slam them instead of shutting them smoothly. 

2. The back up camera doesn't work. Just a black screen and the info tab in the cluster says service blind spot something something. Need to fix it before my wife and daughter can drive it. 

3. Trailer hitch plug has no power at any light position. Hope it's just the ground.   No big deal it's a damn minivan not a truck. I use my truck to pull the trailer. But eventually I'll rewire this so I don't need to use the truck when pulling my lawn mower.

1n8hmbb,Faulty coolant thermostat - could this have caused other damage?,"Recently bought a used 2022 Mazda CX-5 2.0 petrol (naturally aspirated) with 45,000 miles and immediately noticed that the coolant temp gauge wasn't getting much higher than 50°.

I called the dealership and went through the usual diagnostic of does the needle move freely, has it got coolant etc and everything was fine. I booked it in to be checked and they diagnosed a faulty thermostat on the coolant system which was essentially stuck open therefore the coolant system was on full tilt all the time. 

They replaced the thermostat under warranty and now everything is fine but I have no idea how many miles the car has covered with this fault and knowing not everyone monitors engine temp, it could have been for tens of thousands of miles.

If it's been faulty for a long time, could this have caused any premature wear on the engine or cause other problems? I'm worried that if the coolant system has been running at 100% all the time, will the engine and oil have reached it's operating temperature? I'd hate to have an engine that's been running on cold oil most of its life.

And the big question is, get rid of it or keep it?

We haven’t seen a failure of the CCV after the new parts were installed. There is a warranty extension somewhere between like 10-15 years for the affected vins which cover different models.

1n8geam,"W220 S500 - Weird engine noise, lack of power, surging","Hey, I’m completely stumped on this one.

Car is a 2001 Mercedes W220 S500 with about 280.000km.

The car has developed a weird engine running issue.

Full list of symptoms:

- idles perfectly smoothly, revs out fine in neutral
- lacks power, only has power when revved high. Gutless at low revs.
- significant rhythmic vibrations. Like once every few seconds, the car vibrates (does not feel like a typical misfire) and seems to lose power for the duration of the vibrations. It’s like it’s surging. It does this constantly.
- acceleration is uneven. It accelerates, then it pauses for a split seconds, continues accelerating, then goes again. It’s subtle but it’s there. This mostly goes away once the engine has warmed up
- engine running improves significantly when warm, but still doesn’t run right
- there is a very weird noise coming from the engine when accelerating. It sounds like a flutter or a crackling sound. I’ve never heard it before and can’t place it. It is not an exhaust leak, I’ve already checked for that.

I’ve tried to record the noise:

https://streamable.com/qsyu94

It sets misfire codes for pretty much all cylinders, but no other codes.

The diagnosing I’ve already done myself is a visual inspection of the spark plugs and wires, tested the MAF (since it is a known failure point) but the values are within the manufacturer’s tolerances, and fitting a spare one didn’t do the trick.

O2 sensors appear to be operating normally but I honestly don’t know how to see a faulty one.

Fuel trims are within 5 of zero.

I tried setting the car to limp mode intentionally using my scan tool, but besides the engine now having zero power it runs the same.

I brought the car to a Mercedes indie shop for repair after I couldn’t figure it out, but after two days they just returned the car to me saying they couldn’t figure it out so now I’m back to square one.

I’m afraid I’m out of skill and knowledge here. I just don’t know what to check or try. I have an Autel scan tool that can read Mercedes specific stuff if that helps.

Does anyone have a clue on what might be happening?

Dealership can’t figure it out despite multiple visits.,"I drive a 2024 Kia Seltos GT purchased new, it has 15,000km on the odo now. 8-9 months ago the suspension bottomed out with a huge bang over a surprise pothole. Post this I started having a squeaky sound in the rear suspension whenever I went over a speed hump, this further progressed into a light, hollow feeling with hardly audible thuds when driving at low speeds over uneven road. Had the dealership check it out but they couldn’t find anything wrong with it. The rear trailing arm bushing were cleaned and lubricated which solved the issue temporarily for a week. Post this the sound was back with a vengeance. I tired to ignore it, but it progressed to clearly audible clunking noise only at low speeds over uneven roads. 

The suspension was re-torqued which solved the issue again temporarily. Within a month or two I was back at a different dealership with the same issue. The suspension was again retorqued, but within a week I can already feel the hollowness ( feels like the rear of the car is floating/ loose) and the hardly audible thuds over uneven roads.

1n8m1rw,Anyone tried throttle controllers like GOT Boost? Curious how they actually work.,"I came across a device called **GOT Boost** (from [boostgot.com](https://www.boostgot.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) that claims to improve throttle response by modifying the signal between the accelerator pedal and the ECU. It apparently uses different driving modes—including an “AI” one—to tweak the throttle input dynamically.

From what I understand, it doesn't tune the engine or mess with fuel maps. Instead, it just alters how quickly the throttle opens in response to pedal input, kind of like adjusting sensitivity. The claim is that it reduces throttle lag and makes acceleration feel more responsive without affecting the ECU’s core logic.

Has anyone here used something similar (like Pedal Commander, Sprint Booster, or this GOT Boost one)? Does it make a real difference in daily driving or is it more of a placebo?

I’m especially curious if anyone has had issues with these types of devices—like CELs, limp mode, or warranty concerns. The website looks legit ([https://www.boostgot.com](https://www.boostgot.com?utm_source=chatgpt.com)), but there isn’t a ton of independent info or long-term feedback yet.

Total cost to them is about $20 and they charge you $180.  In general it's a total rip off.

The steering wheel felt heavier than usual, not like the smooth assist I’m used to. At first I thought maybe it was just the road surface or tire pressure, but it kept happening even after I checked the basics.

That made me curious so I grabbed carpal  to dig a little deeper. The live data showed the power steering pressure bouncing around more than it should, which immediately stood out. On top of that, it stored a code C121C saying the steering angle sensor was not calibrated, and every now and then a C1219 popped up which also pointed to the steering system.

Right. Now that that is out of the way...

The first thing I would try is the simple fix of rebooting the computer. Dead easy to do. Take the connector off the negative terminal of the battery.

Make sure it's the negative (black wire) terminal, not the positive (red wire) terminal.

Vauxhall say this needs to be off for about 30 minutes but I found that 10 minutes is enough. Obviously I'm gonna tell you to follow Vauxhall's guidelines of 30 minutes though. 

Before you reconnect the battery, make sure everything is turned OFF. Including anything that has an ""auto"" option (like the headlights) and the ignition.

Put your negative terminal back on and tighten the nut. You'll get some sparking as you do this, which I find a little unnerving. You'll also hear some clicking and whineing from around the engine as the car powers back up.

Jump in and start the engine. They can behave a little oddly as the computer reboots and I have found it's best to turn the key to ""On"", let everything come on and sit on until the warning lights that are going to go out do go out, then turn the key to ""Start"" and the engine should go. Try that, it won't cost you anything more than time.

From what you're describing though, it sounds like it might be the sensor. They cost about £10 and there's a video here showing you how to replace them.

I believe I can see where the leak is bc when I pop the hood(I know nothing about cars so bear with me), the pipe/hose that's connected to the coolant reservoir tank would make smoke and a popping sound as the smoke came out, but it was kind of in spurts, so maybe every 20 seconds it would spurt out smoke and make a popping sound.

Aftermarket wheels, TPMS sensors already installed, neither he nor his daughter know the brand. I have an Autel MaxiTPMS tool, and the sensors picked up on the tool as soon as they were triggered. Doing the relearn is asked me main or secondary, and it had to write the IDs, I've done many sensors w/ this tool and thats the first time I had seen that. I initially tried main (it said something about flipping a switch to main, no idea), but after it said relearn complete and the tire light was still on I tried the secondary as well, still nothing. I took it for a ride, nothing. Turning the key off and back on the TPMS light blinks as if theres a loss of communication, so I dont think the vehicle is picking them up. Now when choosing the MHz and year of the vehicle (no wifi, no vin decode) there was an option for a 1010 following 315MHz (i dont know how to word it well) and another for a 1015. I ended up trying the 1015 selection but the sensors wouldn't pick up, until I went back to 1010. My only assumption is that the sensor could be wrong for the vehicle? I truly dont know.

I have a Ford Fiesta 1.4 TDCi diesel. Sometimes when I start the car, the engine begins to vibrate heavily and makes a strange noise, almost like the RPMs are fluctuating, although the OBD2 scanner shows them steady at 750–800 rpm.

After that, the car runs perfectly fine, even at idle.

I’ve been driving Qashqai since 2016 – first the J10, currently a J11 facelift (registered 12/2017).  
Both have been reliable companions so far, but now I’m facing a problem that even makes me consider selling. Maybe someone here has had a similar experience.

**My QQ:**

* J11 Facelift, registered 12/2017
* 1.2 DIG-T
* N-Connecta
* Automatic
* Petrol

**The problem:**

Already last year, the engine temperature suddenly went into the red after about 30–40 minutes in traffic jams or longer standstill. After that, things were fine until July this year (no coolant loss).  
In July, during high outside temperatures and long city traffic jams, the issue came back.

**What’s been done so far:**

* Checked the cooling fan → doesn’t work, but fuses are fine.
* Consulted a Nissan master mechanic: checked thermostat housing.
* Thermostat was defective (stuck open) → replaced.
* Result: coolant leak due to a faulty gasket → fixed.

**New issue:**  
Since the thermostat replacement, air is entering the cooling system. Bleeding helps only short-term. The overheating only occurs when idling for a long time without airflow.  
Suspected cause: head gasket (maybe cylinder head should be checked for cracks).  
Replacing the fan probably won’t fix the air in the cooling circulation issue...

I’m pretty clueless at this point and unsure how to proceed.  
Any advice or similar experiences would be much appreciated!

1n8908x,Seized Bolt extraction tips?,"Good morning! I’m in process of doing some cleaning on my wife’s car (200k miles, Toyota Prius 2013 1.8l) and I was wanting to clean the MAF and MAP sensors after replacing the head gasket. Trying to un-bolt the MAP sensor bolt, I snapped the head off. When using my ratchet it felt like the bolt was rounding off at first, I was getting some resistance. Once I checked and noticed it wasn’t rounding off, I thought it was just giving a lot of resistance while unbolting. I guess it was actually twisting the head off the body of the bolt, because on my text turn of my ratchet it felt snapped the head off. 

Any tips on how to get the body of a bolt that is seized out? I tried drilling a hole and using an extractor bit but it is too seized up for that (I sprayed it with wd-40 about 2 times per day for 4 days to try and let is soak). 

I’ve been reading a lot about heat, but I’m nervous that the bolt and metal hardware it’s mounted too are in the plastic intake manifold. I have both a torch and a heat gun.

You can use the smallest dremel or burr bit you can find,start slow and go easy. Dremel out the biggest part of the broken bolt that you can without getting into the threads,use a blow gun to keep to shaving out of the hole so you can see. You will be able to get it to the point that it will create relief and should be able to use a small flat screw driver or chisel and tap it in the appropriate direction. 

A conventional tap/extractor may not work because of the dissimilarity of the bolt and bolt hole/housing/bracket or what ever. Alot of times the bolt is steel and the housing is aluminum so there's an oxidation that happens and it locks the bolt in place and you get the problem you have now. 

On a side note,you could try getting the area as cold as possible to see if you can break it loose before you go the dremel route. Use regular ice or get some dry ice,might get lucky.

It’s at an independent shop, one with good reviews. There is a 3-year warranty on repairs.

From what I’ve read (in about 15 minutes of Google research), that’s a reasonable price for parts and labor to replace a turbocharger.

I guess I just want to make sure that it’s not stupid to spend this kind of money on repairs for this make/model/year of car??

UPDATE: Thank you everyone, you just saved me thousands of dollars!!! 

So the independent shop had been told by dealer that the repairs would not be covered.

After I read your replies, I called Buick to find out why it wasn’t covered and guess what, there is special coverage attached to the VIN of this car and the turbocharger is covered under warranty.

There is a recall for some engines related to the turbo. Make sure you get that done if applicable, otherwise there's a decent chance the turbo will fail again (but outside of warranty next time). If you go to the dealer for warranty work, they should figure it out and fix any open recalls.

Also pay attention to the oil change interval, turbos are extra sensitive to contamination/degradation. Lots of people (myself included) swear by changing it more frequently than the manufacturer recommends. I have a very different car but I do 5k miles/6 months.

1n8p7xa,Shop quoted me $1100 for clutch and flywheel (parts only): reasonable or too high?,"I was hoping I could get a sanity check on parts pricing for a clutch that may or may not need to be replaced.   

My 2013 Mazda3 (100k miles) has been having transmission issues (whining/grinding etc), basically I knew it was toast, so I took it into a transmission shop to get it rebuilt. They quoted me $2500 for the transmission rebuild, and $1000 for labor for a total of $3500. I’m not stoked about it, but honestly it seems fair enough all considering the job so I told them to go ahead.

Today I got a call from them saying the clutch is 75% worn. Since everything is apart, they will of course replace it for parts only. They quoted me $1100 for a Luk clutch kit/flywheel. This seems quite expensive to me. On RockAuto, getting a Luk Clutch Kit + Luk Flywheel + Expedited Shipping costs $351. Even for OEM, pricing a flywheel, clutch, pilot bearing, pressure plate and throwout bearing from Mazda at full MSRP only totals $977.

I understand that shops markup their parts. If they had quoted me $650-$700 for the parts I probably wouldn’t be writing this. But marking up the parts over three times the price I could pay to get the parts seems steep.

Do you guys think this is a reasonable price to pay for them to install a new clutch? Am I overreacting to the price? My wife is between jobs right now so money is tight. She will hopefully find one soon, but until then, it's hard to swing the $3.5k. If I could last another 1-2 years, I wouldn't mind paying a little more to have that financial hit when I'm a little more stable. 

Is paying an additional $1.1k such a reasonable price for the clutch that I'd be an idiot not to do it now? Or am I getting swindled on the price?

It is not true that once you take them out the threads are done, however generally spark plugs can only be torqued in with a torque wrench once. You need to be very gentle and careful removing and installing spark plugs, since stripping the threads in the block will lead to a massive pain. I rarely use a torque wrench for plugs on personal vehicles myself, and when putting them back in I've always heard (and used) a quarter turn past hand tight.

Back in April she was driving and the CEL started flashing and the engine was sputtering. She had the code read at O'Reilly's and it was P0014: Exhaust Camshaft Position System Performance and suggested replacing the VVT solenoid.

She took it to Pep Boys and they said her oil was critically low and changed her oil. The code went away. For about a month. When the same thing happened. 

Same code. Same low oil level. Another oil change. About a month and a half later, same thing.

And again I'm early July when we took it to a mechanic friend who simply tipped up the oil instead of giving her an oil change.

When it happened again in early August, I swapped out the VVT solenoids (as the code reader suggested), and topped off her oil.

She called last night and it has happened again. There was no oil on the dipstick.

Through all of this, the oil light has never come one.

I can't find any evidence of an oil leak. The engine and bay are clean and there is no oil underneath. I've followed her around and haven't seen any evidence of oil burning. I have not checked to see if there was oil in the coolant, but if that were the problem it would be mostly oil by now as we have added, by my count, nearly 10 quarts of oil since this started.

1n8hvqq,Need advice on fixing stone chips/paint chips,"Hey everyone,

I'm new here, still figuring out how everything works:)

I’m trying to sell my girlfriend’s car and while cleaning it up, I noticed a lot of stone chips where the paint has chipped off. After a quick Google search I figured I could try fixing it myself.

So far, here’s what I did:
	•	I roughly sanded the spots down.
	•	Brushed on a rust converter + rust protection primer (it’s a two-in-one product).
	•	Put on one coat of touch-up paint, then a second one.

The problem: the paint dried way, way darker than the car’s actual color. On top of that, I put too much on, so I tried sanding it down—but it still looks too dark and kind of uneven.

Right now I’m thinking about sanding all of it off again, going back to bare metal, and restarting the process:
	1.	Sand down the damaged areas by hand.
	2.	Apply the rust converter + primer again.
	3.	Put on one thin coat of color.
	4.	Lightly sand with very high grit (maybe 4000?).
	5.	If needed, apply a second coat.
	6.	Finish with automotive clear coat (I have a spray can).
	7.	Wet sand up to 7000 grit if the surface is still rough.
	8.	Polish everything with a polishing kit.

My concern is that the paint itself might just be the wrong shade and will never match. Since I want to sell the car quickly, I don’t want to waste a ton of time only to have it look worse.

Any tips? Should I start over? Is there a smarter/easier way to get this done so it doesn’t look like a DIY mess when showing the car?

The color code of the car is A28/5 Hyper Blue Metallic 
I checked the color code of the paint I bought and it’s A28 Hyper Blue Metallic (is the /5 a different color?Its the only one I could find)

Thanks in advance!

when I swapped the pins and the rubber boot, it was raining 🌧️ so I rushed the job. And then when that didn’t fix the issue.

I was convinced that the slider pin had the rubber part on it maybe it wasn’t letting it slide so I removed it and put everything back together and that didn’t do anything lol. 
Then I thought it’s the small clips that hold the pads in place maybe somehow they were causing the problem, so I removed them and nothing changed. I was convinced it was the caliper or the brake line.

I was worried it had timing issues, but they diagnosed coolant leaking into a cylinder because a cracked intake. They did plugs, intake, and some other things I requested. Immediately after the repair was completed, it overheated about 15 miles down the road. They towed it back, and I got some radio silence. Eventually, they disclosed the head gasket had failed. They said that someone had added some sort of additive to the cooling system at some point. When they added coolant to the system after replacing the intake it caused debris to become dislodged, plugging up the system and causing the head gasket failure. Some more radio silence. I argue they should have known the additive was in the system and it should have been flushed. 

Eventually, they come back claiming the head gasket had been failed this entire time, that draining the coolant and adding more removed the head gasket *sealant* and caused the blown head gasket to be revealed. They are willing to split me 50/50 on replacing the head gasket.

1n8fajt,"Should I change transmission fluid on 10 year old car? (2015 Honda Civic, CVT transmission) 64K miles","The car has 64K miles and I never previously changed the transmission fluid. I never used the car for towing and I don't drive in mountainous areas. 

The dealership recommended the service, but I don't know a lot about cars and like to look into what they recommend first. 

I've looked at other reddit posts, and it seems this is a contentious topic.

Some say that changing the old fluid beyond the recommended service interval can cause particles that were held by thicker fluid to dislodge and clog the transmission (i.e. speeding up the transmission's failure). I read this can be worse with a flush vs. a drain and fill (don't really understand the difference but I guess a flush cleans more aggressively?) There's also a theory that old transmission fluid helps older transmissions grip and shift gears better, and when you put new fluid in older transmissions, they might be more likely to slip. 

Then, there are others that say all of this is baloney and if the fluid is old, change it. They say old fluid will just speed up the transmission breaking down. That say if a transmission breaks post fluid change it was due to coincidental wear and not the fluid. 

So, to change or not to change the transmission fluid? Is my car toast or can it be saved? 

There isn't a recommended interval for transmission fluid for 9th gen (2015) civics other than following the maintenance minder. I think my maintenance minder is broken since it never told me to replace the transmission fluid. I believe the recommended service interval for 8th Gen (2011) civics was every 60K miles. 

I would think my fluid can't be that bad? The car only has 64K miles, which is well below the average mileage for a 10 year old car.

I have a 2015 Rav4 Limited FWD (4 Cylinder/Automatic) with 129k miles. Recently the serpentine belt broke while I was driving up a (residential) mountain which lead to a blown head gasket.

I've already put in $1k in towing, replacing the belt and tension rod, new spark plugs, and new engine coil. I owe just over $500 on it which I pay off this month (of course). I've barely driven the vehicle 20k miles since I bought it in 2020.

The dealership estimated the fix for the head gasket is $4500, or $6k for a new engine (including parts and labor). Estimated trade in value for the car in good shape is $8300ish. I was already planning on selling the vehicle as it's had electrical issues previously and doesn't have AWD which is fairly necessary where I live.

Is it worth paying for the repair and trading it in afterwards, or should I not repair, try to sell or scrap as is, and start over with a new car payment?

1n7y4ez,Car stalling at idle even after solving p0403 code,"2002 Mitsubishi Galant 2.4L 4 cylinder 220,000+ miles. Inherited this car from my grandpa after he passed but car sat for about 3 years until I got it home. Was his daily driver and took well enough care of it. Was trying to solve the stalling issue before he passed. When starting the car it will usually stall when put into drive or reverse. RPMs will sit around 1000 but intermittently dip for a moment. This will continue until the car stalls, sometimes it takes a while, other times it’s almost instant. No check engine light is on. When the car is moving it drives smooth, it’s only when car is idle. *Note that I am clearing codes and doing a reset before any of the repairs I’m about to discuss. 

Ran for codes and got back P0403 so first response was to clean egr valve. This didn’t resolve the issue so I replaced the valve entirely. Car seemed to run smoother afterwards, better idle, but still stalling occasionally and code still popped up. So next I erased code, replaced the egr solenoid, and then drove for about 30 min. Car would still stall when idle at red lights/stopsigns. Came back home, ran for codes again and P0403 code was GONE. Seems replacing solenoid fixed the code but not the issue.

What else could be causing the stalls? No codes pop up but when clicking read codes a pending P0300 random/multiple cylinder misfire shows when I click the “read codes” button. Also at one point a P0181 fuel temperature sensor ‘A’ circuit range performance code showed up randomly but hasn’t reappeared since.

Murky-Service-1013 (Score: 1): That doesn't sound terrible.

Is it a good car? In the context of it being able start and stop and move around you could do a lot worse for £3000, the XY is a high spec. The engine isn't afflicted by major issues like the Citroën Peugeot 1.2 Puretech or the Ford 1.0 Ecoboost so that's a big plus. 

A big question when you say 1.6 however... 1.6 VTI petrol or 1.6 THP turbo petrol? 

The 1.6 engine wasn't actually especially reliable originally but by 2014 they're much better. It's a very quick car vs the vast majority of other options, for £3k it's a bit of a bargain really since it's a relatively new shape model.

If its the rare XY 1.6 THP then it's a real bargain and a bit of a rocket ship, you'd need to make sure you can actually get insured on it since it is approaching performance hatch levels of power and acceleration.

>but it has 88k miles on it so I don't know if it's a good option

Average amount. This isn't a car I would buy to do 200k with, keep your expectations for reliability grounded. It will probably need bits and pieces repairing. You are however saving a lot up front vs an equivalent Toyota / Honda.

My Honda Jazz is a 2014 and has 142k, a 208 1.6 that had been treated as poorly service wise as this Jazz was by the original owner would be in the scrap yard. Furthermore the fit and finish is not a match for Honda (excluding the horrendous Honda paint) or Toyota (Peugeot are great for not rusting though).

In short, buying a Honda Jazz with 150k miles might be a good choice. Buying a Peugeot with 150k miles, I doubt it. So it is difficult to really speak in terms of miles like that. Of course with the one you're looking at being 88k at 3000, that's fine and the lack of absolute reliability and fit and finish is sort of baked into the price by the fact a 2014 with a relatively modern body shape, high spec and large engine is only 3k with 88000 miles.

Not saying you shouldn't buy it just informing you why some models keep value at much higher mileage than others and such, just be aware how little £3000 is these days for a car as well. The absolute floor for a clean car of any type is about £1000."
1n8nfya,Dealer’s finance manager speaking to BNP Paribas rep after my car finance decline — any chance this helps?,"I applied for car finance (Jaecoo J7 on 0% APR) through a dealer, with BNP Paribas as the lender. The application was declined, but my affordability is strong:
	•	Salary: £62k/year
	•	Mortgage: £900/month
	•	Total monthly outgoings: ~£2,600 (leaving around £1,100 disposable)

The issue seems to be with my Experian score, which dropped to 293 due to incorrect reporting:
	•	Creation Flex wrongly marked a missed payment (£32.84 on 28th Aug 2025). I have proof it left my account and was credited the same day — they’ve admitted it’s a system issue and I’ve raised disputes with Experian, Equifax, and Creation.
	•	Credit card balances are showing wrong (HSBC card shows £2,147 but is fully paid, BoS shows £2,589 but is actually £1,300). I’ve attached evidence of this too.

I gave all this documentation to the dealer (bank statements, complaint references, proof of disputes). The dealer told me:
	•	Affordability isn’t the problem.
	•	Since the score drop is due to Creation’s error, that strengthens my position.
	•	Their finance manager will speak with the BNP Paribas representative tomorrow to explain the situation and see if a manual review can be done.

⸻

❓ Question:

Has anyone had experience where a dealer’s finance manager escalated to the lender’s rep after a decline?
	•	Do reps actually reconsider applications in cases like this?
	•	Is there realistically a chance BNP might approve once they see the evidence, or is it just dealer talk and I’ll need to wait until Experian updates my file?

I called the dealership and went through the usual diagnostic of does the needle move freely, has it got coolant etc and everything was fine. I booked it in to be checked and they diagnosed a faulty thermostat on the coolant system which was essentially stuck open therefore the coolant system was on full tilt all the time. 

They replaced the thermostat under warranty and now everything is fine but I have no idea how many miles the car has covered with this fault and knowing not everyone monitors engine temp, it could have been for tens of thousands of miles.

If it's been faulty for a long time, could this have caused any premature wear on the engine or cause other problems? I'm worried that if the coolant system has been running at 100% all the time, will the engine and oil have reached it's operating temperature? I'd hate to have an engine that's been running on cold oil most of its life.

I bought an Automatic Ford Fiesta last year, and recently, the engine light came on and off. I checked the code, and it indicates Code: P0902, ""Clutch Actuator Circuit Low."" I brought it to a couple of garages, and they said that it is a gearbox issue.

  
I brought it to a garage that specializes in servicing Ford vehicles, and the person told me that it seems that I have to check for something inside the gearbox, and it is an 8-hour job, which includes taking the gearbox out, changing the part, and then putting it back in. All in all, this will cost more than £2k. I only spent around £4.5k when buying the car from the dealer last year.

  
Is there any way that I can work around this? Or does anyone have any advice on what to do next? My car drives decent when the light is off, but drags when the light is on, and the light comes on once in a while. I can do an 8-hour drive without coming on once, so I am unsure of what to do.

A quick google of the code has shown a recall for the TCM module on some ford auto boxes. Could be worth checking to see if it is eligible for a recall with your local ford dealer. 

Other than that, maybe look for another opinion from a gearbox specialist rather than your average independent garages who tend not to work on gearboxes all that much. Ford auto gearboxes are known to be pretty rubbish if I’m being honest, but that does mean there may be some specialists that might know a cheaper workaround or be able to replace parts without dropping and opening the box. Call around a few gearbox specialists after you have researched the recall."

1n884r2,Talk me out of an Up GTi,"Uhm, hi. I am currently sort of happily driving a Peugeot 107. It's a good car, done me well and hopefully with an MOT next week will be able to keep doing me well. I'm 23, but passed my test rather late so I'm only two years on the road. 

However, I like my cars, and upon the hours at my part time job going up to around 30 a week, I've made the mistake of car shopping. My main wish rn is a 8-10ish year old hot hatch. Which, I'm noticing, is not a very easy task. I'm in Northern Ireland, where finding these obviously higher specs of cars that are starting to become old is a challenge. That and when I'm starting to be able to afford it.. it's starting to make me a little angsty about how I could end up with a car that I actually really want. I was a kid growing up seeing these cool hatchbacks and now one is tantalisingly within reach. It will be on finance, but it'll be affordable finance right now and I intend to only make more money than I am rn. 

I've shopped around for a bit the past few weeks. There's one Corsa VXR for 8.7k with VXR in the number plate, a 7k Golf GTi, even 5.7k gets me a Mégane RS Cup. There's also a Hyundai i30 turbo which doesn't advertise as a hot hatch but comes with quite a bit of power. A decent Astra GTC is well within budget too, and of course even a Fiesta ST or Focus ST are others I've looked at.  

However, one that's been sticking out to me a bit more is an Up GTi for around 8.5k. it's almost more expensive than every car I've looked at, and also the least powerful, but I know power isn't everything - it's got twice what I have now, and it's likely going to be much cheaper to run in terms of fuel economy and maintenance costs. 

I might be looking with my heart more than my head, but I do understand that the types of cars I'm looking at have a higher chance of being driven aggressively in general, ragged around nutts corner or even taken to the ring. The repairs for wear and tear things are probably going to be quite expensive, and more common than I'm currently dealing with. 

I don't think the up will suffer from these issues as badly as the others, it seems very manageable despite fitting the definition of a hot hatch - insurance is barely more expensive than my gutless 107. It's also a similar size of car as the one I currently drive, so it'll be an easy transition. 

I know it would be infinitely smarter to just buy myself a much younger polo or something but I just can't help think about how much I would like to be able to say I drive a gti. I just don't know how much that's clouding my judgement. In the worst case, I have difficulty actually acting on big decisions so there's every chance I drive the Peugeot for another 5 years.

Suzuki Swift

Honda Jazz

Toyota Aygo

If you want something bigger go for:

Polo/Golf/Fabia/Leon/A3

Civic

Octavia

If you do short distances prioritise petrol, if you do longer distances consider diesel. This is because whilst diesels offer better MPG they have a DPF - which requires motorway driving around 1-2x a month at high revs to ""regenerate"" (clean). Makes sense if you have a longer commute or do a regular long journey.

Imo Civic is the sweet spot of being small but also usable with a decent size boot and loading capacity with rear seats down. Depending on which on you go for it can look pretty good and be specced quite well inside.

Avoid ex-taxi cars though and check for full service history and good MOT history (no major signs of rust or mileage discrepancies).

I have just had my MOT done on a Fiat 500 2011 and wanted to get the opinions how much I paid.

  
The MOT its self was £60 as we use a mobile mechanic and a good friend of my neighbor. 

We have used him in the past and it's usually been ok price wise although it feels like the prices are creeping up now. (Probably due to the cost of living ect)

I was initially quoted £410 for the fixes not including the position lights as I wanted to check to see if that was a simple fuse check. The fuses were fine so I asked him to take a look at the light issue as well.  

He had informed me that it would be an extra £180 due to the whole nearside lamp (bottom position light) needing replacing due to corrosion and broken wires. I think he had to get this from the fiat dealership rather than after market as he couldn't find a replacement in time.

I have attached the MOT and Invoice, it would just be good to get someone else's opinion on this as im not too car savvy and I need to get my power steering looked at on my Landover Freelander 2 so don't want to be paying loads extra on that if needed.

  
The £650 is inc £60 for the MOT

Don't send anyone money for a report, let anyone test drive it without proof of insurance, or tell anyone your address/where the truck is kept until you're absolutely sure they're genuine.
