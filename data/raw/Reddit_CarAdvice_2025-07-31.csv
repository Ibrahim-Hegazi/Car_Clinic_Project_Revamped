1mdm81t,2017 Camry idling vibrations fix,"My vehicle had idle vibrations when vehicle was in drive or reverse and disappeared after giving some gas. I figured the issue is a broken torque strut engine mount as there were cracks .

I got the spare (not OEM) and went to the mechanic to replace it. After replacing l, the mechanic mentioned the mount which was still in my vehicle was not broke and I still asked him to replace it.

The vibration is better (still very minute vibration present) after replacing with aftermarket mount, so did I waste money on replacing a good mount ?
Also I know aftermarket mount is unreliable (the mount itself has less weld area, but also I don’t expect to keep the car for more than 1 year)

1mdm4wk,What is the point of putting the back up camera slightly offset from the Center?,"So I’ve noticed all major manufacturers except for Mercedes, which sometimes integrate the camera into the emblem directly so when you back up, it pops out basically directly in the center underneath the emblem.        

Will put the camera slightly offset in either to the left or right.             

I’ve had a back up camera installed onto my car aftermarket, the wolf box rear mirror camera set up, basically the same kind of set up a late model Corvette has where it’s constantly running feed into the rearview mirror.         

And when the stereo shop wired it up, they put it to the right, but I asked them to put it directly in the center. But it got me thinking, why isn’t it put directly in the center?         

In my opinion, it looks far more aesthetically pleasing, and it ensures it gets an entire view of the back of the car.          

I never understood why basically all manufacturers put it slightly offset to the right. Online I read that it supposedly helps with the wide angle lens, to ensure there’s no blockages, but if you put it slightly to the right, wouldn’t the view be slightly skewed to the left? And vice versa?            

Wouldn’t dead-center be the most optimal location?

Recently I have come across an issue where if my tank is anywhere below half, and I put any amount of gas into, my car will not crank upon trying. The engine will turn over repeatedly and sputter and the radio/Bluetooth will come on, but then the car will die and flash the battery and oil lights. I have to sit and continually crank, fail, wait a moment, and crank again until it eventually works. Sometimes pumping the brakes helping the car start faster and sometimes it doesn’t. When it does work, the entire car seems to sputter and shake before settling, especially if car was on low gas before. However, my father borrowed my car last week and told me he put gas in while the car was running and no issue (obviously, seeing as the car was already, but there were no dashboard lights that came on). I am aware it’s dangerous to put gas in a car while it’s running so I don’t want this to be the solution, but I’m unsure what could be causing it to happen. Some family members think that because my car has no gas cap (just a magnetic flap to cover the nozzle insertion and a lid), that oxygen getting into the tank might be the cause, but that doesn’t make much sense to me. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Difficult starting after fueling is often due to a faulty *evap purge valve* which is part of the evaporative emissions controls.  Fueling causes the evap cannister to fill with fuel vapors.  Normally the valve would be closed and open later to allow the vapors to be burned by the engine.  When the valve sticks open, the vapors from fueling accumulate in the intake manifold, and when you try to start the car, the fuel injectors are also adding fuel.  Then you have too much fuel, which is as bad as too little, and the car won't start.

There may be diagnostic codes stored even if the check engine light isn't on.

In the meantime, you may be able to start the car by holding the gas pedal all the way down while starting.  What this does is put the car in ""clear flood mode"" and turns off the fuel injectors, and lets the engine pull in the vapors from the evap cannister.  Then you can reset and try starting the car normally.

If it turns out to be a bad purge valve, replacement is fairly easy and not very expensive."

But, Every 3 months or so, I run into this issue where if I'm accelerating, usually from a stop, the truck will rev really high and the rpms will keep going up without shifting to the next gear. The truck will still accelerate, but it will rev past the rev line without actually shifting. The problem will go away by pulling over and then turning the truck off and on again. The problem will then not show up again, usually for weeks, if not months, and then do it again. The truck shifts great, otherwise, no bucking or lunging or anything concerning like that. So, I don't think the transmission is going bad, but I'm not a super expiranced with these old trucks, so I could be 100% wrong. Could it be a vacuum line?

The oil burning is just due to poor engine design choices. If the engine is running ok otherwise, I would recommend that you just keep the oil topped off and full and just drive it. I would not spend the money on rebuilding one of these, that money would be better used to purchase a better car.

My usual shop hooked up gauges and low side was 80-100psi and high side was 100-120. His conclusion was a bad txv but unfortunately he was too busy to take it on at the time. If pertinent, he did an evac/recharge 3 times during all his testing after the new compressor didnt fix the issue. 
So i took it to a larger shop and their conclusion was that the compressor was bad already, possibly from debris in the lines and to have the lines flushed and the compressor replaced. They did not hook up gauges, only to some other testing/diagnosis device.

This stuff let me preface with be very mindful of where you put your hands, you can get burned or pulled into a belt easy. It sounds stupid but the simple stuff you're not looking for is what bites you.

Quick and easy things to check/do. Start it and open the hood, the remote starter doesn't normally work with the hood open so don't get caught off guard if the engine dies. Then with a flashlight look at the belt and all the pulleys to see if things look pretty in line and everything is rotating squarely. If you see something wobbling, take a picture to describe it later. 

Now assuming nothing is wobbling, I'd try dressing the belt. Get a stick of belt dressing or a bar of soap, while it's running push it into the belt a few times. It will grind off the bar and coat the belt. That will take off any misalignment and usually stop noises, so if it still squeaks it's probably in a bearing. 

To find that, with the engine off and preferably a cool engine, take pictures of the belt to see the routing for reassembly, loosen the tensioner and pull the belt off the easiest to reach component, usually the alternator in the top left corner, could be different on yours. That will give you slack on the belt to check it's condition and you can turn and wiggle each pulley and component by hand to see if you find any movement or a loud bearing as you spin. If you find something off or questionable you can upload another video of the noise, but it will probably be your issue. 

Worst case you find nothing and you probably need to find someone to look at it. Had a truck squeaked like that and wound up being the lifters ate the cam, but I don't think you're having anything that bad"

I’ve also heard stories of CVTs developing issues right after a fluid change, so I’m a bit nervous.

I am testing with a Co2 liquid detector if it is a head gasket problem, as the expansion tank broke. Thankfully the coolant spilled while I was stopped in front of my house and I did shut down the engine within seconds. When it cooled, I checked I had still some coolant inside the expansion tank.
I replaced it and my mechanic says I have to replace the head gaskets as the coolant circuit gets pressure (he checked it with a bottle of water and a hose).
I had doubts about the efficiency of that examination, so I bought the Co2 tester.

After 15 min and at mid temperature, no change of colour, but the coolant start to ascend trough the pipette.
The level of the coolant is within limits, at its max level.
The overpressure of the video is normal?
Is it gaining some pressure?

Blue smoke is probably a piston breaking, letting tons of oil into the exhaust(or into the intake via the PCV system) which then burns and turns into blue smoke.  The broken piston has let the connecting rod flail around and eventually it got wedged somewhere so the engine won't crank anymore.

I'm assuming it's the Subaru in the photo. The threads do look a little oily, not sure if that's just a normal condition for a Subaru, can't really tell if there is oil on the porcelain possibly indicating a tube seal leak.

I've also seen a spark plug that looks perfect causing a misfire. So if you are dealing with a check engine light/misfire looks alone may not tell you anything. Normally you'd swap the plug to a different cylinder and see if the misfire follows the plug.

1mde2kr,Mechanic might be ripping me off,"I'm writing this post because I'm not sure if my mechanic is trying to rip me off with my Mustang Ecoboost 2018 Performance Package.

Here's the full story:

I recently got a check engine light and weird startups on the car, and took it to a nearby mechanic for diagnostics. They checked the engine, hooked it up to the computer and determined the car had faulty spark plugs. The car has around 89k kilometers so it was time to change the spark plugs anyway.

This was a local (but certified) Ford mechanic, and they told me the spark plugs were jammed, and that if they tried to force it they would most likely break. All of his guys were on vacation, so he told me that if they break I would have to wait weeks to get someone to even try fixing it.

I thanked him for the diagnostics and took the car to a larger city (another certified Ford mechanic). They assured me that they could change the spark plugs, and even if they broke, they had the guys to fix it.

Thankfully, they managed to get the spark plugs out without breaking them, and switched them with new ones - NGK 96621

I was driving the car home, and was going 140km/h with no issues. I tried speeding up to overtake at around 170km/h, and the car lost its power and got a blinking check engine light. I pulled over, and the check engine light was not blinking anymore (but still active).

I tried to run the car again after some time, and at around 110km/h the blinking check engine light happened again, and got disabled again after stopping.

I had the car towed back to the mechanic, and they ran the following ECU codes:  
P0300 - Random/Multiple cylinder misfire detected  
P0301 - Cylinder 1 misfire detected  
P0303 - Cylinder 3 misfire detected  
O0316 - Engine Misfire Detected on Startup (first 1000 revolutions)  


They didn't bother much to check anything else - just told me that it's not the spark plugs and not the coil packs.

They want to charge me 2,5 - 3k euros to open up the engine and ""analyze"" what the issue is.

I went on to check the spark plugs they installed on NGK's website, and their official website declared that these spark plugs do not fit the Mustang Ecoboost. 

I checked with ChatGPT and some other more experienced people, and pretty much all the answers I got that the issue seems to be with incorrect spark plugs (maybe incorrect gap) or ignition coils.

The car literally has no other symptoms - no exhaust smoke, no shaking, no bad sounds, no harsh startup, coolant levels normal, runs just fine on lower speeds under lower pressure.

Would appreciate any guidance on this as I'm not experienced with situations like these. 

These mechanics turned a normal spark plug replacement job into a 10-day open-engine job.

They ran no other tests whatsoever on the car - just decided they had to open it up to see the issue.

You could pay the labor to do the head gasket replacement, but at that mileage you might want a full redo of the timing components just to future proof it a bit.  At that point the engine swap might work out to be cheaper, and leave you with a limited warranty.  Or you might find someone to take it in this condition as is and use that to get something in better condition.

1mdf3h9,Coolant Pressure,"Range Rover L322. V8 4.4 (M62B44) gasoline. 2004 year. 

I am testing with a Co2 liquid detector if it is a head gasket problem, as the expansion tank broke. Thankfully the coolant spilled while I was stopped in front of my house and I did shut down the engine within seconds. When it cooled, I checked I had still some coolant inside the expansion tank.
I replaced it and my mechanic says I have to replace the head gaskets as the coolant circuit gets pressure (he checked it with a bottle of water and a hose).
I had doubts about the efficiency of that examination, so I bought the Co2 tester.

After 15 min and at mid temperature, no change of colour, but the coolant start to ascend trough the pipette.
The level of the coolant is within limits, at its max level.
The overpressure of the video is normal?
Is it gaining some pressure?
I also see no variation at all of blue color.

In winter (I am in Spain so it is summer here now) the car leaked some coolant in the rear part when the heat air system was activated. No leaks since April (no activation of heat air system), the level of coolant was never below minimum as I check it every time I have to drive the car. 
Maybe it gains overpressure via those leaking hoses of winter? 

I am planning to repair those rear coolant hoses before the head gasket operation asap.

If your coolant bottle is that high when it’s off, it’s WAY overfilled. The orange stick is only supposed to be level with the cap when cold. 
Let it cool, suck some of that out with a turkey baster or something and dispose of it properly. Then you can do a gas test. Otherwise your fluid could be contaminated by coolant.

The m62b44 and the tu version which I think you have an M62TUB44, run their cooling system at a higher pressure than domestic/American cars. 
If your cap has a 140 it holds up to 1.4 bar, 200 for 2.0 bar. So it’s likely the coolant is boiling somewhere and pushing coolant into the bottle there causing an overflow."
1mdec0c,Car switches gear but won’t reverse. 2 mechanics cannot find the problem,"APOLOGIES FOR THE LONG POST THIS IS A VERY CONVOLUTED ISSUE. 

TLDR: car switches gear but will not reverse on occasion it stays stuck in drive. Took to 2 mechanics who said nothing is wrong with the car and it runs fine. No transmission issues, no electrical issues. Please advise. 

My boyfriends car (2014 ford focus SE) started having a bad stutter after driving it in the heat for 2 hours on Monday after getting an oil change. We pull over to get coffee and it does not start back up at all. After some jiggling of the wheel it starts back up but the stutter (usually when hitting 15 mph) became really severe and the rpm would hit the max and the car would not speed up. We get an error message that the transmission overheats so we pull over, give it 45 min to cool down, add coolant, and the error message goes away. 

We get to the destination with no problems about 1.5 hours later. When we try to leave the location the car switches gear into reverse but DOES NOT MOVE. It only moves when it is in drive. Luckily we were near a mechanic who came over, checked the codes on the car which mentioned the transmission then cleared them. The check engine light turns off and he says the car when into “limp/safe mode” but should get us home fine (which it does). Once we get home and try to parallel park, the car stops going in reverse again so we had to do the same thing with attempting to clear the codes but there were no codes to clear. After turning the car on and off about 15 times we get a 15 second window where the check engine light turns off and we can reverse just long enough to get into the spot. 

Fast forward to the next morning the car is fine again and we take it to a transmission repair specialist. 4 years ago he had his clutch completely replaced so we weren’t sure what the issue could be. The mechanic does a test drive, and a full diagnostic on the car but says nothing is wrong with the car, and the transmission is fine. We take the car to a resturant nearby because it’s driving fine again and, boom, when we try to leave it DOES NOT REVERSE. It doesn’t even stay in park it only drives and we have to put the e break on. We call triple A and they tow it to a second mechanic. The second mechanic calls us this morning and says NOTHING IS WRONG WITH THE CAR. They even did a full gutting of it to look for any electrical issue and found NOTHING. They did a 10-mile test run, it’s fine. We are afraid to keep using this car if the issue happens again.

1mcybxx,Issues with 2018 Kia Forte EX,"Hi guys! I’ve been having issues with my car this whole summer and wanted to see if anyone else had some ideas. To preface i’m not a car person and I might actually be totally overthinking this whole thing. 

So around may i wanted some food for dinner and stopped at a place to pick it up and then when I was leaving the parking lot, my car stalled.  Not sure if this is important but about a week or two before this my car battery died and had to be replaced and I did so. Anyways my neighbor who owns his own mechanic shop and is a really
good family friend and his wife came to help me because my parents were busy. My car gets towed and eventually ends up at my neighbors shop. 

A week later I get it back and the fuel filter and high pressure fuel pump were replaced. Now my car runs but it felt slightly sluggish. Since I had been driving my dad’s car that had a lot more of an umph my parents brushed it off but I could tell my car was just accelerating a little slower than usual. I drive it a little bit because at this point I’m just a little scared of driving after my previous break down. I go to store to get my friend a birthday gift and when I’m leaving i start reversing and then when i start going forward my car makes an odd clunking(?) sound and i park again and halfway into the spot the engine stalls out on me. I get it towed to my neighbors shop and he tells me that it was the primary fuel pump and replaces it at no cost. 

I get my car back and it feels better driving at lower speeds. I drove it for like two minutes on the highway and it seemed fine. As i drove it more though, occasionally it would seem sluggish. Because my car had now broken down twice in the span of two weeks I had barely been driving it. Today I had a doctors appointment across town and this required me to take the highway for longer. I noticed that when it came to parts that were kind of uphill my car struggled to get to even 70 mph. I had to push down a lot on the gas to try to get it to accelerate more. It just feels like it doesn’t respond as quickly as it did before and I am so lost. 

If anyone has any ideas or has experienced this please let me know. I love my car and I love driving and this has been ruining my summer. My car has been super reliable the last two years so I don’t know what’s wrong with it all of a sudden. Thank you guys so much!

It’s not just surface rust, the metal is flaking and has holes in it.

On top of that, I also need to fix an exhaust leak and replace both the front and rear brakes.

The rest of the car is still running well, and I like it, but this rust seems pretty extensive. I’m considering taking it to a body shop to cut out the rust and weld in new panels, but I’m wondering if it’s even worth it given the age and upcoming repairs.

Do you think it’s worth fixing (welding and repainting) or would I be better off putting that money toward another used car?

1mctbcs,What are your go-to tool brands for DIY or weekend wrenching?,"Just curious what everyone here prefers. I’ve been wrenching as a DIYer and part-time tech, and I’ve gone through everything from Harbor Freight to pro-tier gear. Some tools surprised me with how well they held up, others… not so much.

Do you have any surprising favorites or tools you regret buying?",2,1753838143.0,12,automotive,1753990568,2025-07-30 01:15:43,2025-07-31 19:36:08,"FailingComic (Score: 1): Kobalt tools are great and have never failed me. My 1/2 impact from them got beat to crap and used in down pours and never missed a beat. The sockets, granted I didnt have any impacts from them, are easy to read and made well. Never failed me at my mechanic job. Gearwrench handtools are also great.

Now that ive been using my dad's tools at his shop, he mostly has snap on and SK. Personally? Your not missing out on anything using ""home"" brands. The only reason we  mostly use the brands we do is because getting a replacement is easier. He doesnt feel like having to go out of his way to go and replace it at a store so its really just convenience for hand tools.

For electric tools, legitimately there are differences. We had the milwaukee 1/2in impact, 3/8 and 1/4 ratchets. Recently my dad bought the snap on 1/2 impact... it walks circles around the milwaukee. When both batteries are fully charged its probably decently close but at half charge the snap on retains all of its power where the milwaukee might struggle to get lug nuts off. My kobalt i dont have at the current shop to compare but I imagine itd have less power than the milwaukee.

For an at home mechanic, I dont think the investment in hand tools is worth it for what are considered premium, snap on/matco/Cornwall etc. The cheaper tools have all caught up and are just as good. Electric is now where the new tool wars lie and your going to want to either keep it cheap or be ready to spend big. The difference in power between harbor freight, kobalt, ryobi, dewalt is all pretty close. Unless you know you need crazy power like we do with some specific stuff like axle nuts with 300ftlbs+ its not worth stepping up the milwaukee or snap on. The only caveat to this is if you want to get into the milwaukee tool system for the yard tools and other home tools. The milwaukee yard tools seem to be better than the harbor freight ones but just in general id look into the full ecosystem outside of auto tools to see what catches your eye before deciding on one.

1md5pfe,2019 Nissan Sentra couple issues,"Just got this car few months ago at 100k miles. V4 engine, CVT transmission.

1. When I start my car after not driving it in a few hours, it has a hard time going into reverse, kinda have to force it. Once I start driving, it doesn’t have any issue at all going into reverse. So if I wake up, go to the store, it’ll have a hard time going into reverse to back out of the parking spot. But once I get into the store, shop, come back out to leave, it doesn’t have any problem reversing. While driving, the changing gears (automatic) isnt the smoothest but nothing crazy no complaints it doesn’t make any noises or anything like that just sometimes takes half a second more than it should to change gears. That part might just be it being a cheaper transmission.

2. Whenever I brake, Theres lots of rubbing sounds. My dad said it seems to be coming from the front passengers side. He said it’s probably rotors. I have no issue braking at all, just makes that noise. Sometimes makes a tiny tiny squeak.

3. This I’m not worried about unless I should be, but sometimes I have to reconnect my Bluetooth when I’m not playing anything for a minute because it’ll go mute. I also sometimes have to wait for the Bluetooth to load before I drive the car or else it’ll mute too. And sometimes both volume controls (wheel and radio) don’t work well while driving.

4. I live in Florida and during the day, it doesn’t blow cold air. Sometimes it’ll be partially cold after running for a minute, but not truly cold. Then at the end of day when it cools down outside a little bit, around 4-5ish, the AC has no problem freezing me out.

1md4l91,Car shaking under acceleration,"This is an urgent call for help as my insurance company is pushing for me to scrap my car following an accident a few weeks ago. 

I want to keep it but I also need to know if its worth keeping. It has several issues but there is one that bothers me most. I need to know if its a sign that something is going to break soon and if its going to be an expensive repair. 

The accident was only three weeks ago but the car has been aggressively shaking for about a year. It only shakes under acceleration and over 50 mph. It feels worst at about 60 mph and becomes increasingly violent when going uphill. It has been to three garages and no one has found a fault that would cause the shaking under load.

Vehicle is a manual 2009 Vauxhall Agila B, 1.2 litre petrol. I have attached a picture of the car most recently but please note, the only new issues that have arisen with the car since the accident are a cracked exhaust flexi hose and tracking issues. This problem has persisted long before this. 

Things that can be ruled out:
- Spark plugs / misfire
- Wheel alignment, tracking and balancing
- Tyres
- Control arm / suspension 
- Brake discs / pads

I took it to a Vauxhall dealership for a service and asked them to diagnose it but the best they came back with was leaky shocks. I am no mechanic, but personally I think the issue must be related to the engine or a component that transmits power from the engine as it shakes strictly under acceleration. The reason the above things can be ruled out it because they have already been checked and replaced. 

For now, buying it back and doing the most urgent repairs is the most affordable option for me. If I can’t figure it out soon, I might have to accept the scrap value as it could be an expensive issue and the clutch is already on its way out… I rely on my vehicle to carry out my work so I need it sorted ASAP.

PLEASE does anyone have any more suggestions??

1mdlu76,Nissan rogue check engine light.,"Hi everyone, 

A bit of background to help with my issue. 2015 Nissan rogue with 60k miles/100k km no prior issues with it.

Recently had the oil changed and car looked over before a road trip and there were no issues per the mechanic. Took it on a road trip of approx 500 km up a few mountain roads and she drove fine. I parked it in really hot sun for 3 days on a dusty farm while at a music festival and when I turned it back on for the first time the check engine light came on. It drove totally fine however, temps are fine, oil and coolant levels are fine. She’s driving the same/just fine, recently went to the closest town over and took it over a mountain pass on the way there no problem. No issues with idling, no misfiring that I can tell and I haven’t really noticed a difference to my fuel economy but it’s hard to say for sure. 

Finally made it to a town where I could buy a code reader and I ran the code, which came up as P0171, “system too lean”. I’m driving to the Rocky Mountains and then all the way back to Vancouver so will have a few mountain passes and a 1000 km to go before I’m home. I’m wondering if there are any major concerns in having this addressed once I’m home vs right now, it’d certainly be a massive headache to try and deal with this now as I have campsite bookings to make and no mechanic can take me on zero notice and trouble shoot whether it’s a vacuum leak, fuel issues or sensor problem.

Right after he bought it, he had triple bypass surgery and he didn't drive it for months.  I took it out at least twice a week so it was driven. In January, the check engine light came on, it was an O2 sensor. We fixed it, everything was great.  In March, he started it and it was running really weird.  He drove it to Auto Zone to check the codes, threw a code for spark plugs.  He bought new ones, changed them, and the next day the lights were still on.  He drove it less than a mile down the road to the shop, they told him it was a head gasket, no oil in it, and whatever else. Quoted him $4,600.  We paid it, they kept it a month, we got it back. Check engine light came on before he even made it home less than a mile down the road and it was running like it was before he brought it in. He turned around and took it back. Now they say it's the catalytic converter and some senors and selenoid. He says fine, fix it. $3,000+ more. We get it back a month later. Check engine light comes on the next day while he is out with some people. One of the guys says to bring it to his shop, he does the next day. They find there is no oil in it, the other head gasket has failed, and so much else is wrong. They tell us the first shop should have told us to either replace the entire engine OR replace BOTH head gaskets. We call the first shop, they basically said ""Yeah okay, and? We fixed what was wrong"". So we write a letter to the corporate office of the shop. Turns out this location is a franchise, so the guy in charge of all the franchises calls us and said the franchise owner wants to speak with us. We went in today.  All he kept saying was ""No judge will ever side with you"" and ""You were out 3 quarts of oil when you came in! This was all YOUR fault because you obviously don't know how to take care of your car!"".  Refuses to take ownership over the fact that it's well known in the mechanic world (at last the second shop told us this) that when replacing one head gasket, you need to replace both on this car in particular because the other will fail. So now we are out over $8K and his car still won't run properly and we have 5 kids to cart around and only one car to do it. This guy is telling us he won't pay for a new engine or take any responsibility because he can't lose the money for a new engine. He is saying that would be close to $20k. I'm not even sure what to do at this point. I wasn't expecting this guy to be so incredibly defensive, I mean... he even said ""Doctors misdiagnose people all the time and there no consequences for them!""

1mde436,Mechanic might be ripping me off,"I'm writing this post because I'm not sure if my mechanic is trying to rip me off with my Mustang Ecoboost 2018 Performance Package.

Here's the full story:

I recently got a check engine light and weird startups on the car, and took it to a nearby mechanic for diagnostics. They checked the engine, hooked it up to the computer and determined the car had faulty spark plugs. The car has around 89k kilometers so it was time to change the spark plugs anyway.

This was a local (but certified) Ford mechanic, and they told me the spark plugs were jammed, and that if they tried to force it they would most likely break. All of his guys were on vacation, so he told me that if they break I would have to wait weeks to get someone to even try fixing it.

I thanked him for the diagnostics and took the car to a larger city (another certified Ford mechanic). They assured me that they could change the spark plugs, and even if they broke, they had the guys to fix it.

Thankfully, they managed to get the spark plugs out without breaking them, and switched them with new ones - NGK 96621

I was driving the car home, and was going 140km/h with no issues. I tried speeding up to overtake at around 170km/h, and the car lost its power and got a blinking check engine light. I pulled over, and the check engine light was not blinking anymore (but still active).

I tried to run the car again after some time, and at around 110km/h the blinking check engine light happened again, and got disabled again after stopping.

I had the car towed back to the mechanic, and they ran the following ECU codes:  
P0300 - Random/Multiple cylinder misfire detected  
P0301 - Cylinder 1 misfire detected  
P0303 - Cylinder 3 misfire detected  
O0316 - Engine Misfire Detected on Startup (first 1000 revolutions)  


They didn't bother much to check anything else - just told me that it's not the spark plugs and not the coil packs.

They want to charge me 2,5 - 3k euros to open up the engine and ""analyze"" what the issue is.

I went on to check the spark plugs they installed on NGK's website, and their official website declared that these spark plugs do not fit the Mustang Ecoboost. 

I checked with ChatGPT and some other more experienced people, and pretty much all the answers I got that the issue seems to be with incorrect spark plugs (maybe incorrect gap) or ignition coils.

The car literally has no other symptoms - no exhaust smoke, no shaking, no bad sounds, no harsh startup, coolant levels normal, runs just fine on lower speeds under lower pressure.

Would appreciate any guidance on this as I'm not experienced with situations like these. 

These mechanics turned a normal spark plug replacement job into a 10-day open-engine job.

They ran no other tests whatsoever on the car - just decided they had to open it up to see the issue.

1. Car cranks but engine will not start
2. Live data shows 0.0 for TP%
3. Pedal sensor is functioning fine
4. Back-probed TB pins while battery was running, all pins seemed to have correct voltages + sensor pins changed voltage when manually opening throttle plate.
5. Checked wires in wiring harness between ECU/TB with multimeter and they are all undamaged + working fine.

I also checked a new TB and I had the same issues so I switched back to the old one. Does all of this point to the ECU not receiving the voltage from the TB? It’s also not sending voltage to the TB to open the plate.

All four of these are LOW voltage circuit errors that meaning the ECU is not supplying the expected 5V reference to these sensors, or it is failing to interpret the returns.

Also, when you drain the radiator, does it drain the reservoir too? Because it was full when we opened it after draining the car empty.

Personally I'd go anywhere that does tire rotation service, ask for that to be done (you can call around for pricing, it's a fairly cheap service at many places (especially small local tire shops), and rotating the tires involves removing all four wheels). Just ask if they'll put your new hubcaps on as they do the rotation, I'd find it ridiculous if a shop wouldn't do that for no extra charge.

Edit to add: I noticed your photo shows a Firestone tire. Did you happen to buy the tires at a Firestone location? If so you can take it to a Firestone location for free rotation (and ask for the hubcaps to be swapped at the same time). Maybe tip your technician a few bucks for making your problem go away for (almost) free. Be aware that the free rotation will probably come with other service recommendations/upsell, but just decline all that and tell them you'll keep it in mind.

The most difficult bit will be buying the right size replacement, they match to the wheel diameter. Yours are 15 inch based on your tire size, P195/65R15, R15 is the rim/wheel diameter. There are other sizes available so be careful shopping.

FYI, those wheel covers are completely cosmetic. Taking them off and running just the bare steel wheel isnt going to cause any problems.

1mdlv9c,Need help,"I’ve been dealing with this issue for over a year now since I got the car. I drive a 2021 Hyundai Sonata SE with the 2.5L engine, and I’ve had it looked at by Hyundai multiple times — pretty much every few months — and it’s still not resolved.

Here’s the problem: When I’m going uphill or lightly pressing the gas around 1200–1400 RPM, I hear a knocking or pinging sound that definitely sounds like pre-detonation. As soon as it shifts or I let off the gas, the sound goes away.

One of the service advisors straight-up told me, “Yeah, it’s probably pre-detonation, but it’s normal — all my cars do that.” That just doesn’t sound right to me at all.

To rule things out:
	•	I ran a full tank of 91 octane a few months ago — no change.
	•	Hyundai even tested the fuel at one point — still no answers.
	•	My basic OBD2 scanner shows no codes, but the dealer used their tablet (I don’t know what they saw — they didn’t explain).

I’m now planning to bring it to a local mechanic for another scan and hopefully a more honest opinion.

Has anyone else experienced this with the 2.5L engine? Is this actually normal, or is Hyundai brushing off something that could lead to long-term damage?

Rock Auto shipped me these. Both made in 2021 per the box. They say this is normal? I say it’s not because I had a set of 6 month old bilstein 4600 on the back but they were too stiff so I wanted to buy what the factory had. The bilsteins rebound at the same rate, I went to oreilly auto parts and auto zone parts and their cheap shocks on the shelf rebound at the exact same rate.

Rock auto says it’s normal because that is what industry experts say. They said they will not warranty exchange these for other shocks and that if I don’t like them, I have to return them which I’m sure will incur some shipping and restock fee’s. I really just wanted a pair of shocks that were the same rebound rate. One rebounds faster than the other and that one is probably 5% stiffer than the other shock when compressing so I’m not sure which one is supposed to be correct for a soft ride shock.

I’ve worked on cars for 26 years as a hobby and professionally when I was younger for 9 years and when I checked new shocks, they always rebounded the same rate. Now a days it seems we’re supposed to “just deal with it”.

I found sidewall cracking in all four tires, but this one was the worst by far.

I replaced the worst tire next day, and the other three a month later.  

My questions: 

1. How bad was this? 

2. Was I overcautious to abandon my family’s event/roadtrip? 

3. Or was it so bad that I should have towed the car to the shop instead of driven it? 

The technicians at both shops didn’t seem to think it was a big deal, so I am second guessing myself a bit.  

Either way, the lesson learned here: inspect tires more frequently and not on the same day as important events that require driving.

1. Torn right cv boot(see pic). $716. There isn’t any clicking or grinding coming from the cv joint currently.
2. “Engine oil leak from timing cover and other sources” I have noticed a small amount of oil on my garage floor at times recently(like 1 tablespoon). Dipstick is still reading at top mark a month after the last oil change. $5137 for engine reseal. 
3. “Coolant leak from radiator assembly.” There hasn’t been a change at all in the level on the coolant reservoir over the past month, so hopefully it’s a small leak. I haven’t seen any coolant pooling on the garage floor. $930 to replace radiator, lower hose and upper hose.

1mdeat4,Mechanic might be ripping me off,"I'm writing this post because I'm not sure if my mechanic is trying to rip me off with my Mustang Ecoboost 2018 Performance Package.

Here's the full story:

I recently got a check engine light and weird startups on the car, and took it to a nearby mechanic for diagnostics. They checked the engine, hooked it up to the computer and determined the car had faulty spark plugs. The car has around 89k kilometers so it was time to change the spark plugs anyway.

This was a local (but certified) Ford mechanic, and they told me the spark plugs were jammed, and that if they tried to force it they would most likely break. All of his guys were on vacation, so he told me that if they break I would have to wait weeks to get someone to even try fixing it.

I thanked him for the diagnostics and took the car to a larger city (another certified Ford mechanic). They assured me that they could change the spark plugs, and even if they broke, they had the guys to fix it.

Thankfully, they managed to get the spark plugs out without breaking them, and switched them with new ones - NGK 96621

I was driving the car home, and was going 140km/h with no issues. I tried speeding up to overtake at around 170km/h, and the car lost its power and got a blinking check engine light. I pulled over, and the check engine light was not blinking anymore (but still active).

I tried to run the car again after some time, and at around 110km/h the blinking check engine light happened again, and got disabled again after stopping.

I had the car towed back to the mechanic, and they ran the following ECU codes:  
P0300 - Random/Multiple cylinder misfire detected  
P0301 - Cylinder 1 misfire detected  
P0303 - Cylinder 3 misfire detected  
O0316 - Engine Misfire Detected on Startup (first 1000 revolutions)  


They didn't bother much to check anything else - just told me that it's not the spark plugs and not the coil packs.

They want to charge me 2,5 - 3k euros to open up the engine and ""analyze"" what the issue is.

I went on to check the spark plugs they installed on NGK's website, and their official website declared that these spark plugs do not fit the Mustang Ecoboost. 

I checked with ChatGPT and some other more experienced people, and pretty much all the answers I got that the issue seems to be with incorrect spark plugs (maybe incorrect gap) or ignition coils.

The car literally has no other symptoms - no exhaust smoke, no shaking, no bad sounds, no harsh startup, coolant levels normal, runs just fine on lower speeds under lower pressure.

Would appreciate any guidance on this as I'm not experienced with situations like these. 

These mechanics turned a normal spark plug replacement job into a 10-day open-engine job.

They ran no other tests whatsoever on the car - just decided they had to open it up to see the issue.

1mdb052,Battery/charging system trouble after minor body work,"So I recently had to get the right fender replaced and some paint correction on my 2024 Honda Accord. 
I took it to the body shop recommended by my insurance.
The damage was mostly cosmetic, however the front right headlight assembly was cracked in the back and had to be replaced. However everything in the car worked as intended, even the headlight. 

After I got the car back last Friday, I noticed the head unit had reset which I figured was normal and that they probably had to disconnect the battery. But when driving it home. The auto start stop system wouldn't work and the dash said it the battery was charging. I thought it was weird as it normal works just minutes after starting the car up, but I didn't think much else about it. 

I parked the car and it sat until Sunday morning, and when I came back to it. It was completely dead. The locks wouldn't even work without the backup key. 
I jump started it and it ran fine but after driving for an hour the auto start stop system still wasn't working and AutoZone tested the battery and it came back as bad. 

After another hour of driving the battery finished charging and it seemed to work as normal. 

However now everytime I start the car in the morning, it takes 30 minutes to more than an hour for it to fully charge and the auto start/stop system to work.

When I took it back to the body shop, they said they did have to jump it once but since it was charged when I got there the battery tested as good. 

They said they didn't even have to disconnect the battery.

So my question is, when could have happened while they had the car to cause this? 

Did they leave the accessories on and the battery as damaged now and wont hold a charge? Or could they have somehow done something that introduced a parasitic drain. 

It definitely seems that when the car sits for any period longer than a couple hours. The battery takes a very long time to charge back up 

I do plan to take the car to a dealership but I'm worried they are going to try to charge me for something the body shop should fix or pay to have fixed. 

Any help would be appreciated!

1md9elk,Please help me diagnose tail light issue,"I have a 2021 Jaguar F-Type R that I recently bought used.  I didn't check the daytime running lights prior to purchase.  However, I have no evidence that the LH rear daytime running light was ever running correctly.

The light is 2 bars- a top LED and a bottom LED with a ""U"" shape.  The RH LED lights work correctly. On the left side, the ""U"" LED is dim, and the upper LED does not illuminate. When the brake is depressed, all lights turn on correctly and brightly.

I assummed it was a bad unit.  I tested the wiring by running a wire from the LH wiring harness for the daytime lamp to the RH tail light that was known to work correctly and ground.  When I turned on the car, the RH tail light worked correctly, suggesting the daytime running wiring was OK.  This led me to conclude the LH tail light was bad.  Of note, the unit harness has 3 total connectors- presumably LED

I (30f) honestly went in expecting to fail lol. But my brakes were the only thing i was expecting to fail. Expensive but doable. I just needed the inspection done because i was way overdue and i didn’t want to get towed bc i park on public streets for work.
Anyway, I have 15 days to come back with the repairs done or whatever. 
The problems are:
 
my plate light which i feel like i can definitely do myself. They wanted to charge like 70$ not including labor for this.

The muffler and exhaust is “broken” but nothing is leaking and the only thing from what i can see from when i went under is that some clamps are broken. The only thing visibly wrong with it is that it’s super wobbly. It also makes a “growling” noise a little louder than usual when i start it up but it goes away when i hit ~40mph. But im thinking that thats just from the new position the muffler is in it sits a little lower because of that broken clamp. (I can provide video evidence later today if needed) coming in at around 600$ or 800$ i can’t remember off the top of my head.

The breaks (obvious one) i think they want to replace the whole system on all four? But I honestly think i can honestly get away with just the pads though. My brakes do squeak but only in the morning or when the temp outside is low. typically anything above 60 degrees F is when they stop. 
There is no grinding sound coming from any of the four breaks. however i do have a pretty steep step to make to get the car to stop. But it has no problems stopping otherwise. 

And the tires 
i work as an in-home behavior tech for children with autism visiting roughly 5 or more clients a day. I Drive pretty far and and my workplace doesn’t want to cover for regular maintenance. (Yes Im trying to look for a different job) so the treads where low but the mechanic did not fail me on this. Just told me to get all four replaced soon to avoid complications. Which i agree no contest with after looking at them myself 😭 (its bad lol)

Most of the total is for labor. What can i do myself and what should I leave to the mechanic?

Also the engine leaks are probably gonna be a head gasket that’s gone; which is an expensive repair. And the differential leak is also gonna cost you. Those are the repairs that are probably gonna spell doom for this car.

1mcvsk2,Please Help with limp mode on 2019 Equinox,"Hello,

My wife and I were in her Equinox last week and the check engine light suddenly came on and an alert saying ""Engine Power Reduced"" came on.  

We made it back home but I noticed every time she tried to get some acceleration, there was a whining, whistling noice coming from the passenger side of the engine, which made me think of a broken/disconnected hose or maybe something with the turbo.  

I did a lot of searching on Google and using ChatGPT and found there’s a common issue with some of the hoses for the turbo cooldown but I didn’t notice any issues with those.  

I removed the waste gate actuator from the turbo and was able to manually pull it and have it return to its closed state.  I was also able to open and close the flap on the waste gate freely when the actuator was removed.  

The only thing I was able to find that seems iffy to me is the PCV Valve cover port and the hose that goes from that to the turbo.  It is very loose when I wiggle it on both ends but I’m not sure if that is a product of the types of connections or if there is an issue with the hose itself.  

I’ll attach some pictures.  Also, if it helps, the codes on the OBD were P0101, P1101 and P0299.  

If anyone could provide some insight or diagnostic steps, that would be very helpful.  I’m not in the place right now to have to bring one of our daily drivers to the mechanic, unfortunately.

Hello, coming to this reddit during a difficult time to make an informed decision on what to do with my car. I have a 2008 Scion xB with 240,000 miles.

I first brought my car in because I was having trouble accelerating. It would overheat and all the dashboard lights would come on. Then when I made it past the 30 and 50 mph marks, the lights would come off and the engine would cool off. I brought it into the mechanic and they said oil was getting into cylinder two. I replaced the coil and replaced all the spark plugs.

Two weeks later, my car wouldn't start. They deemed it to be a starter issue and I then replaced the starter.

Now I ran into more issues where the check engine light was on. They are now saying that coolant is getting into the engine and it is because I have a leaking head gasket.

Given all of this, what should I do? I've spoken to a couple of mechanics who have said it doesn't make sense to repair that old of a car with the potential for the engine to have warped. They said I could replace it with a low mileage engine but it is hard to confirm an engine is low mileage and it is complex work for this type of car. Furthermore, my car still might run into issues after that.

But more than likely in your case you might need some shims. The starter may have come with some in the box."

If you suspect coolant, and it’s been leaking for a while, you’d definitely notice. Especially when your car warms up, there would be steam, possibly even a pressurized stream of water. The most notable thing you would see would be running out of coolant. So if you’ve notice the “leak” for months and your car hasn’t over heated, it’s probably not coolant 


It also would help to know a few more things;
- is the fluid hot after you drive the car?

1mcs404,3 different mechanics/no diagnosis (nothing wrong) but check engine light will not turn off and emissions will not pass. I have no idea what to do.,"# Context: 

Car is an old 2001 Toyota Highlander. Runs like a beast.

\*\*Its been a couple years since seeing these mechanics so my memory is a little shot. All I want to do it register my car but the check engine light won't turn off.\*\*

The 3 mechanics were all within one year of each other. I had the check engine light turn on and I took it into the first mechanic. I dont remember the codes but it was likely P0456 because it had something to do with an Evap leak which triggered a ""smoke"" test to be ran. It was around $300 bucks and it passed the test and he put on a new gas cap because he said older cars tend to trigger the check engine light with faulty gas caps. 

The engine light was reset and it ran like a charm but the light came back on 6 months later. 

2nd mechanic said the same thing but instead of telling me it needed a smoke test, he went ahead and did it and charged me for it after. I was pretty pissed but i didn't say anything because I was happy he reset the lights and said nothing was wrong with it. Another $300 for the smoke test out of my wallet

When it came on a couple months later, I really wanted to be done with this light and I was willing to pay anything to get rid of it. 

The 3rd and last mechanic said there was nothing wrong in the initial diagnostic and said a smoke test would be meaningless since it passed the first two times. He reset it once again and I was on my way. He said replacing hoses wouldn't do much but cost money and said to come back in when the light comes back in and he'll try and re-diagnose it. He didn't even charge for the initial diagnostic which was nice.

Well it came time to register my vehicle and no matter how many times I reset the light, it comes back on before I can make emissions. What do I do? It has been expired since 2023 and I just got pulled over for it last month. Am I allowed to get a mechanic to sign off or will the DMV give me some sort of exemption? I was thinking something could be wrong with the sensor that errors get filtered through but I don't know.

I'm looking at getting a mark 4 Toyota RAV4, like a 2018. (I believe they're much less likely to get stolen.) The front wheel drive ones are cheaper to buy and insure, and said to be more economical to run. &nbsp;

Opinions seem divided on whether all-wheel drive is worth it – everybody says tyres are more important. But does a front-wheel drive feel generally the same to drive as a AWD (or is it 4WD)? I went for a test drive in an AWD last weekend and loved it. There is a fantastic surge of power when you put your foot down. It feels easy and fun to drive. Do you get much the same feel from a FWD version? &nbsp;

Also... I'm used to driving small cars, and the RAV4 seemed mighty big. (Even though in America they think of it as a compact SUV, hah.) When I did a 3-point turn I was nervous of grinding this vast superstructure against some obstacle. Am I right in thinking you get used to the size fairly quickly, you start to get a feel for where the fenders end? &nbsp;

- Big boot for our dog 
- Ideally an automatic because the fiance hates driving 
- Something that is easy to maintain, cheap-ish to run, LEZ compliant, and has reversing cameras/good infotainment/ideally blind spot detect 
- Something that’s better at overtaking than our 1L polo

This is double what the manufacturer recommends - but because I can do it all myself it only costs me about £60 a time.

1md7rd7,Advice on garage delays with my car,"I bought a MK4 Ford Focus ST Edition from a garage in march of this year. All was good and very happy with the car. A month down the line me and a group of friends plan to go on a roadtrip around wales with our cars so i plan to use the included ""ford performance"" coilovers (comes with the focus st edition) and adjust them to the ""bumpy b road"" setting, turns out the bump stop on the front passanger side has fallen off whilst the front drivers side has seized. I phoned the garage who comfirmed this would be fixed under warranty and took the car back up in june and given a courtesy car. It's now been 5 weeks without the car and i'm getting more and more frustrated.

Each time i phone the garage up they are ""waiting on parts"" with no ETA. the garage is hours away from where i live and so can't just pop over. I have been told i can get the car sorted at a local garage near me and the original garage will cover the costs. So i got a quote from ford and gave the original garage the quote only to be told it's a lot higher then expected and to give some time to ""sort it out"". The bloke on the phone said the coilovers only cost around £100 whilst ford are charging around £500 per corner. Ford also gave me an ETA of around 2-3 weeks (so what's taking this garage so long?)

In addition to this the garage phoned me up to say the courtesy car i have been given MOT runs out that day. I had to scramble and take a day off work (unpaid) to get the car sorted as i have no other means of transport.

Key thing to be cautious with, is the EGR, swirl flaps (AKA Grenade flaps) and DPF. If these are only used around town they clog up and cost a bit to fix. If you're willing to pay a bit of money and get those deleted with a reasonable eco tune they're fantastic bullet proof engines. 

Airbag suspension can go bad, common choice is to just get normal coils iirc. I had some bags leak, just had them changed and it wasn't actually that bad, bigger issue is if they have been left bad and the compressor has had to keep pumping them up and then if that breaks that's where they're an expensive fix.

As a car, they're lovely. They have buckets of torque so you really do get going quickly, I wouldn't say they're rapid but you're definitely going to be pleasantly surprised how fast it is for its size. Handles very good too, if you have driven a truck or an old toyota SUV or something these handle like a 5 series. BMW really did make a nice handling SUV when they brought the X5 out. 

I miss mine, but the EGR did go and other bits linked to that system, made me wish I just had it blanked off and mapped, I had an E92 3 Series with the same engine where I had the Swirl flaps, EGR deleted and DPF gutted and it ran 600nm reliably without fault for years. So, I recommend doing this and I wouldn't have an M57 without doing it myself. It's basically an engine with some reliability problems that you can delete for £500 or so, so if you look at them in that context it should help you decide."

Just quickly wondered others opinions as I've got a new car and just want to get rid of this old one, but never sold a car, so both don't want to rip anyone off, but also don't want to undersell myself

I'm planning on listing my **old Mazda 2, 2010, 1.3L V-TEC Petrol with 95000 miles, just been MOT & serviced with a mostly full service - I'd like £1180 for it which is lower than the average price (£1500 - £2000)**

Reasons for the price being that high:

* I've just serviced it (oil, and air/oil filters), MOT'd it, 2 new front tyres, one rear shock changed (the other was done less than a year ago). Spark plugs were changed at 88k miles and the brake discs and calipers were done around 90k miles. Engine is generally in good condition and I've looked after it. MOT history is fairly clean (no big red flags to me)

Reasons for having the price this 'low':

* The car was previously keyed along the whole of passenger side (still don't know who by) and has a few bumps and scratches. I've repainted the key mark and need to do the final polish (can just see it in the photos) but it's not perfect and still visable to the eye. Also the service history is partial with 1.5 year gap and the recent services were done by me (all went well but obviously not offical stamp).   There are a few other minor bits and scuffs which I feel also reduce it a bit overall.

Car: Mercedes-Benz, cla 220d 4matic, 17 plate, 114k miles, worth around £6,000–£7,000 if it were in good shape.

Current issues:

Gearbox: Delayed gear changes, revs high before shifting (esp. 2nd–4th), sometimes jolts and hangs in gear. Garage says valve body/solenoids issue.

Rear differential: Knocks and has had metal filings in the oil for 2 years – still drives but getting worse.

So basically:

Engine light constantly on.

Gearbox and diff are both on borrowed time.

Intake/EGR needs a major clean or replacement.

But there will be a genuine buyer out there who's probably some sort of mechanic or can have it sorted and then resell it or use it themselves. As for the price, assuming it's decent spec and worth £7k when running properly, you might get £3.5k for it if you're patient (?). Have a look at other similar age non runners and you'll get a better idea. Could be more could be less.

The longer you continue running it the higher the chance you risk complete timing chain failure at which point your value tanks considerably. Your main selling point is that it starts and drives currently.

As an example, I found a rather clean Dacia from a dealership that's about 30 miles away. They deliver for free to my postcode, but thanks to public transports it'd take me 1h30 to get there ( and a small mortage in train tickets probably ) so I thought I'd just contact them and have it delivered, as is. It's risky I know, and that's why I though of checking the dealership online, but that's where things turn a bit strange - They're listed on AutoTrader as AKMotors, but I can't find a single reference to them online, anywhere.

1md3ycz,Mileage Reduced or DVLA bug? Sketchy CAT-N Fabia?,"(Photos inside)



Looking for a second car. Found this 32k miles Fabia 1.0L Petrol near me. I ran one of these car checks online. And it's a CAT N actually (not mentioned in the Facebook ad).

Also, there is a weird mileage mismtach (see photo). The miles go to 38000 back to 32000.  
And 32k seems in line with the previous MOTs mileage increases.

The mismatch is also noted to be around the time of the write-off (CAT N). So maybe it's just a DVLA incorrect record entry at the time of the insurance claim?

Otherwise the car looks great, and MOTs are solid since it's low mileage

1md0w9g,Confused and needing help - reliable not too large car for motorway driving?,"My car (Honda civic, which I loved and had for 14 yrs with no problems!) has been written off and I need a new (aka used) car. I’ll be doing mainly motorway driving, roughly 60 mile round trip per day (due to change or circumstances - wasn’t doing those miles in the Honda). I need something reliable, comfortable and safe and hopefully without large maintenance costs. Have two kids so a decent boot is needed but doesn’t need to be massive. I don’t know much at all about cars so have been reading lots here and elsewhere and tbh am more confused than ever. I would have automatically gone for another Honda civic (albeit I don’t like the look of the new shape compared to my old one) but I’ve read stuff saying to be careful about which engines and about wet belts etc (well beyond my me) and I’m not sure if there are better  options for motorway driving. 

I was thinking of a used Toyota Corolla hybrid estate (reliability wise seems good) but I’m really not used to driving anything of that size and wondering if I will struggle with the size day to day. Not sure whether a diesel (which I know nothing about including maintenance) or hybrid makes sense (no ability to charge where I live).

To be honest unless you have very difficult parking to deal with I wouldn't be too afraid of something like a Corolla estate, they're not gigantic and you adjust to a bigger car pretty quick. It would be a good choice. For a 60 mile motorway commute bigger is generally better, for the comfort and noise deadening.

1md0h9a,Right to Reject from Car Dealership,"Tldr; Purchased a car that is now showing signs of battery/electrical faults. I’m nearing end of 30 days and am about to give birth and am seriously considering exercising short term right to reject as I don’t have time for the faff. Do I have to give them opportunity to repair? Worried it will push me beyond 30 days and I’ll lose rights. Anything else I should consider?

Hi all. 

England - I purchased in cash a 2022 Cupra Formentor V1 1.5 TSI earlier this month (8 July) from a dealership a fair distance from me. As of 28 July a fault appeared with the battery/electrics, and the car will not start. 

I reported it by email to the dealership immediately. They were on the case today getting me booked in to a more local dealership for diagnostics which I have now booked in for Friday (1 Aug). 

However, having analysed the potential cause and history of the fault over the last couple of days I am feeling less and less reassured that this is something they will be able to fix easily (this 3 yo car is on its third battery which is now dead)

The kicker is that I am 9 months pregnant (now overdue) and really do not have the time to go back and forth to garages trying to get this sorted so I notified them in writing today that I may choose to exercise my short-term right to reject the vehicle under the consumer rights act (which I would have to do by 7 Aug). 

The dealership then called me and said that if I wanted to I could go to Halfords and get another 12V battery and fit it so I can use the vehicle in the meantime and they will refund me. I rejected this on the basis that (1) I believe this car has to have any new batteries fitted programmed in and (2) I don’t want to continue to use the car except to get it to the garage after expressing the possibility of rejecting the vehicle. 

I still plan to take the car to their dealership for diagnostics - and have already arranged to get it there today just in case I go in to labour before Friday - but my main question is do I have to accept any repairs/solutions they offer, as I am concerned they will ultimately try to push this beyond the 30 day right to reject period given how close it is?

Is there anything else I should be doing or not doing in preparation for the right to reject? 

Thank you in advance!

I just recently gave a car back and I told them officially I am rejecting the car under the consumer rights act 2015 as it did not meet the criteria because it was not fit for purpose due to a child lock fault. This was sent a week or 2 from the purchase date. 4 months later (they took too long with my case) the car was given back and I was returned all my finance payments alongside the deposit and I did not pay for the mileage I put on it because I quoted this law to them before the 30 days.

You should go ahead and tell them you reject any repairs and want to give the car back as its not of satisfactory quality before the 30 days is up. Getting the rejection in writing is the main part.

The argument that fixed car tax based on engine size was ‘unfair to lower emission vehicles being charged at the same rate as heavily polluting vehicles’ was used to justify a move to emissions based taxation to help the environment and allow the consumer to make informed decisions. Ecologically sensible; but that was at least in economic terms unsustainable, because that meant that over time, taxes coming in declined to the tune of billions, especially when zero tax EV’s started to gather momentum. So then it became “EV’s and high value vehicles are heavier and damage roads more, so the current taxation system is unfair; instead let’s tax based on vehicle value instead, so EV and very high value vehicles are paying their fair share”. Not untrue, but doesn’t really impact the quality of the roads anywhere near as much as heavier commercial vehicles do. 

It all comes down to governments currying favour in order to get votes, stimulate economic activity, and keep the working happy; but it is always short sighted, and then puts a giant hole in the public purse, which needs filling on the next cycle. You only have to look at government white papers to see that since the days of £30 road tax, both the Conservatives and Labour have recognised that they cut off their nose, to spite their face; and have to find a way to stem the bleeding.
