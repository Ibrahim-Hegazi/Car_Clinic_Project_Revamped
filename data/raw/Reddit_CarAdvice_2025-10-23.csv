dealers are usually either a hit or miss and it’s pretty cutthroat there- i can’t speak from experience though cause i’ve only worked at independent shops and chains. 

unfortunately, if you do decide to start- you will most likely start from the bottom.. so as a lube tech. pay probably won’t be as good as what you’re getting now, so you will more than likely have to take a pay cut.. unless you miraculously find a place that wants to pay you as much as you’re getting now with not any real professional automotive experience. 

once you make your way up to a technician role, your paycheck is practically what you make of it. you get paid flag rate, there’s a set amount of hours you will get paid for when you do a specific job (manufacturers make these rates for the specific cars), you win by beating the set time. for example if a certain job calls for 6hrs and you finish it in 2hrs, you win. 6hrs worth of pay just for 2hrs of your time. or, it can go south- and you can spend 8hrs on that job but only get paid for the 6, that’s when you lose.

1odnhon,Peak throttle position bellow 100%,"I have bought a car 4 months ago, it is a 2006 corolla with the 1.4 4zz engine. Recently while monitoring sensor data just for the kicks of it, I noticed that the throttle position can not get above 92.16%, at first i thought that that the carpeting or something prevents the pedal from reaching it's bottom possition, witch is not the case. It is a cable throttle and opening it all the way by hand, by twisting the throttle itself produces the same number. I have 0 issues with that car so far, apart than the fact that once in while it might not fire up first time, but that could be due to the fact that it has a dual fuel system(petrol & lpg), letting it run for 3-4 seconds with petrol before sutting it down prevents it for what i understand. So is that reading normal or not ?

Btw i have not tested it while the engine is running, but i dought it makes any difference as it is cable operated, the idle possition is at 14.5% while running or not, and the idle is fine, i have had no issues with it.

>It is a cable throttle and opening it all the way by hand, by twisting the throttle itself produces the same number.

This proves that it's how it should be.

It's done on purpose.

One reason could be explained by example of electronic anti shutter valve on some VAG car diesel engines. It's exactly like throttle. It's used for shutting engine and to help with egr. The position sensor on them goes exactly from 0% to 100%. And as it's used the plate and hindge wears. With enough wear the position sensor will go beyong 0% and 100%. So suddenly the sensor will go over as they left no extra travel on sensor. Then the system will think it's at the opposite end and constantly try to force it in exactly wrong direction. So you'll have to change the part. Some people have fixed them by adding a limiting tap."

A system too lean code can go one of two ways. Sometimes it’s quick and simple, other times it’s a bit of a chase depending on how the vehicle is behaving. A good shop should be able to explain their diagnostic process and what the costs will look like before getting started. In most cases lean faults are diagnosed within about an hour, though that’s just to identify the cause, not the repair itself

Also try to avoid the free diagnostics trap. It might seem like you’re saving money, but if a shop isn’t being paid to properly test and verify the issue, it often leads to parts being replaced unnecessarily instead of the actual problem being fixed

1odlofo,2002 F250 7.3 PowerStroke,"Hi all —

Picked up a 2002 F-250 7.3 L and the blower motor isn’t coming on. I’ve traced the circuit with a multimeter and test light.

Here’s what I found:

Slot 85 (coil power) on the blower-motor relay has no voltage with the key ON.

Slot 86 (coil ground) is open and does not complete a ground path.


To test, I jumped 12 V into slot 85 and grounded slot 86 to the chassis — the relay clicked and the blower motor came on. All fan-speed settings worked, but the blower stayed on even when the selector was in the OFF position.

This tells me both the relay and motor are fine (I think), but:

The coil power feed from Fuse 28 → slot 85 is open inside the Central Junction Box (CJB).

The ground side (BN/YE wire from slot 86 → function selector → G201) is also open.


So it seems the CJB may have an internal fault or a damaged trace.
Before I bypass it, I’d like to confirm there isn’t something I’m overlooking.

Is there a reasonable or known workaround for this issue?

Clean it out with compressed air to verify that it is indeed the source of the leak. If it is, find a bolt of the proper size and length and install it, after coating the threads with thread sealant.

My mother wants to give me her car and use mine for trade in when she gets a new car. Emotionally, gut instinct I don’t want to do it, but ultimately I want to make a logical decision. Both cars have around 40,000 miles. Both have one area with a bit of superficial damage on one of the doors. Her argument is that the Acura is safer and will last much longer. Is this true? I know a lot of people really swear by their Pontiac vibes and hold onto them for like 200k miles. The gas mileage is better on the vibe also. 

Basically is it actually an upgrade? Is the car genuinely better? Are repairs going to be more expensive if needed? Are there common issues with the 2015 Acura RDX? Does it have a good life expectancy? Generally I worry that newer things tend to be built worse.

Pontiac will be cheaper to repair if anything breaks, and there's lots of them in junkyards if need be. Acura will be the nicer to drive vehicle, will have more features. Basically if you wanted a nicer car that's still very reliable and has more tech, go with the Acura. If you just want a nice cheap A to B car that's also very reliable, stick with the Pontiac. Another thing to note is the Pontiac will likely not get a very good trade in value compared to the RDX.

I have a 2017 Hyundai Elantra with about 117k miles that’s currently inoperable — it won’t even turn over.

Back in April, I took it to a mechanic because it started driving weird. They said it wasn’t the timing belt but the entire timing unit, and quoted me around $5,000 to fix it. I couldn’t afford it at the time, so I drove it home (it died about six times on the way), and it’s been sitting ever since.

Next month is my last car payment, so I’ll have the title soon and could junk it if I want. I thought about taking it somewhere else for a second opinion, but the last shop charged me $285 just for a diagnosis, and I’d also have to pay to have it towed.

Now I’m torn — with how awful the car market is right now, would it be smarter to just pay the $5k to fix it instead of getting a new car loan? My worry is spending all that money and the car not lasting another few years or at least another 50k miles.

Would fixing it and then possibly trading it in make any sense? Or should I just cut my losses and junk it?

Cold temps and parasitic loads like a hardwired dash cam will pull it down overnight — most cams have a low-voltage cutoff to avoid killing your battery. I'd have the charging system tested to rule out a weak alternator and check the dash cam's cutoff settings, but a year-old battery from Walmart should still be fine.A fully charged lead-acid battery should be around 12.6–12.7 V at rest; 12.2 V means it's only \~50 % charged. Your dash cam with a hardwire kit likely has a low-voltage cutoff, so when the battery drops below a threshold the camera shuts off to prevent a dead start. If the battery is new, I'd load-test it and have the alternator output checked to make sure it's charging at 13.8–14.4 V.

1oda48k,Passenger side window broke for seemingly no reason…,"I don’t know if this is the right place to post this so sorry if not.

Something strange happened to me today. I turned up to my job and parked my car in the designated car park (part of another company car park), walked into work, then 10 minutes later when all my colleague arrived I was told that I needed to go outside and look at my car as my passenger window had smashed. This hasn’t happened to me before so I didn’t know what to think but I assumed (as most would) that this was the result of vandalism.

After sweeping the glass up from the floor I was approached by the owner of the car park to say that they did not see anything happen but that they would check their CCTV. The result of this is that the CCTV shows there were no people or cars next to mine at the time of the smash - very odd.

The car has been collected, sent to an approved garage and the garage has informed me that as the window pane has gone (smashed to bits in the car and on the floor outside of the car) that they are unable to confirm if this was a manufacturing error - they are saying they can’t inspect the potential fault (duh). The car is less than a year old.

My question for this group is: Can something like this really still happen with modern cars, I am assuming due to the difference between the internal and external temperatures?

My question for another group (unless someone here has any helpful advice) is: what are the chances that I actually get the manufacturer to cover the cost of this seeing as it appears that the pane had a fault and this was responsible for the break and they are saying they can no longer insect this.

It would have to be an EXTREME difference and happen quite suddenly to crack glass, although side windows are designed to shatter rather than crack so you can escape in an emergency. Your window motors forcing themselves up also is unlikely bc they’re not very strong, coming from someone who’s accidentally closed their fingers in a mini cooper window. So temperature changes, or weird electrical issues, are both technically possible, but extremely far from probable. Were you parked somewhere where a rock could’ve been kicked up? I’ve seen rocks crack windshields from 25ft off the road, and CCTV cameras generally suck enough to not pick up a tiny rock flying Mach Jesus towards your window. I doubt the manufacturer wants to cover this bc they’re the worst about hard facts and proof, but fun fact from someone who’s worked at a dealership for years, cause enough of a headache for the service manager and they’ll cover it just to get you out of their sight. We had a lady leave her sunroof open (her fault) then let the car sit damp long enough to grow mold (her fault) and traded her into a slightly better car after a week or so just bc everyone involved was so done listening to the complaints.

Monday morning I got an oil change (2017 Lexus RX 350 w/ 75,000 miles) before starting a 1,000-mile road trip with a friend. About 300 miles into the trip, several warning lights came on: AWD malfunction, ICS malfunction, low oil pressure, and check engine. I pulled over and saw a large oil leak underneath.

Had the car towed to a local shop and stayed overnight. The mechanic there said there was no gasket on the oil filter, so the place that did the oil change either forgot to install it or didn’t tighten it properly and it came off. They replaced the filter, added oil, and said everything looked fine.

The car ran perfectly for about 200 miles, then the exact same issue happened again, same warning lights, oil leaking underneath, and I had to get it towed and stay overnight again.

Could the first incident (running low or out of oil) have caused lasting engine damage that’s now leading to another leak? Or is it more likely something was still installed incorrectly?

If the first guys missed the seal on the oil filter, I would be hoping the oil filter cap isn't cross threaded, maybe ask them to check the drain tap on the oil filter cap aswell.

Once they refill the oil you'd want the prev leaks cleaned, test driven and rechecked for leaks to see if there is anything still leaking.

- I doubt the local mechanic would've made the same mistake of forgetting the gasket

- Stuck gaskets from old filters on 2GR-FKS threads are pretty obvious to spot so it's extremely unlikely both mechanics somehow double gasketed(?) without noticing

It's entirely possible that the filter housing itself became warped or cracked when it was first tightened without a gasket. If the local mechanic reused the damaged housing, a leak could occur from the same spot, regardless of whether a new gasket was installed."

Please dont listen to people saying it would be much better to do it yourself.  Yes, doing pads and rotors can be a pretty good job to do diy if you have no experience, but it will take time and if you have no tools you need to spend the money you would save on the first job on a proper jack, jack stands, and possibly sockets and a breaker bar. If your bf is up for it i say go for it. 

But if you’re doing the caliper too, that is gonna invite more things you could do wrong the first time. You have to crack the bleeder screw, and if you have no experience theres a good chance u will strip it on an old car. And u have to properly bleed the breaks or u risk a serious safety hazard for yourself.

The car drives very smoothly, but at times at very low speed( while parking) and idle on Drive  the rpm keeps fluctating rapidly 9620 to 750 rpm) which can be felt and seen on the rpm gauge.  
The rpm jump doesnt happen on park or neutral and the issue disaapears if i restart the car. There is no check engine light nor any error codes as such.  
I briefly recorded engine data during the jump and immediately restarted and recorded the data again at drive.

But what I prefer much more is to have each option separated so that we could pay once and have it for a lifetime, even if each option costs more than the subscription, because if we decide to sell the car and buy another Volkswagen, we could still use the pre-heat function on the car.

We’ve tried getting the engine to start but nothing has worked. While trying to start the car all the dashboard lights flicker quite quickly as well as the interior lights dim and brighten a bit, and there is a rapid clicking noise from the engine. once resetting the key and not trying to turn it, the speedometer and rpm’s bit, the needle vibrates really quickly and then settles. we were starting to think its a battery issue but all other functions work before trying to turn over the car, all the lights on the dashboard are lit okay until attempting to start, window wipers all work, radio kicks in with no issues, electronic mirrors work and all the interior lights work again until attempting to start.

The battery may have drained itself as the car has been sat idle and barely used for a good few months and the battery was replaced brand new at the start of 2024.

NotAPreppie (Score: 2): The cracking is a symptom of dry rot and it means those tires are done.

The rubber has hardened from exposure to UV, heat, and oxidizers like oxygen and ozone. It doesn't flex like it should anymore, thus the cracks. That also means that you won't get as much grip in braking or emergency avoidance maneuvers.

Eventually, the cracks will get so bad that the tire will no longer hold air. You may get lucky and find this out when you come out to your parked car and a tire will be flat. You may get very unlucky and it will blow-out catastrophically at highway speeds."

1oczwko,Question about hydraulic rack and pinion power steering systems,"Hello! Pictured are my two cars - 2004 BMW E46 325xi and 2008 Jeep Liberty KK Sport.

  
The E46 has long been my daily up until February this year (passed down from my dad to me, I learned to drive in it in 2016-2017 and it was my daily up until 2025). I bought the Jeep Liberty when the E46 broke down and we were planning on scrapping it - I ended up turning the E46 into a DIY project and its since been repaired and is back on the road (Feel free to ask more about this story because it was a wild ride).

  
Anyways, now the question. The E46 family is very famous for its linear and responsive but stiff steering. I always attributed its stiffer than average steering to the fact that it uses rack and pinion hydraulic steering instead of electric power steering like most modern cars do. I kind of assumed hydraulic steering typically meant more force was required to turn the wheels, which is why most cars are electric power steering now (for comfort reasons) though many enthusiasts prefer hydraulic steering for its better steering feel and handling and don't mind that more force is needed to turn the wheel.

  
When I drove the Liberty for the first time one of my immediate observations was how much lighter the steering is compared to the E46. And now that the E46 is fixed and I've had multiple opportunities to drive both cars back to back on some days, I can confirm the Liberty definitely has lighter steering than the E46. As such I assume it was full electric power steering. However, when I did my first oil change on the Liberty recently, when I got under the car I was surprised to find a good old fashioned rack and pinion steering setup! So it turns out the Liberty is hydraulic steering just the same as the E46.

  
So the question is - if they are both hydraulic steering, why is the Liberty's steering so much lighter compared to the E46, especially when its a significantly larger and heavier car than the E46? The Liberty's steering is legitimately lighter than many electric power steering cars I've driven. I had no idea that hydraulic steering systems were capable of being that light.",25,1761111245.0,23,CarTalk,1761248140,2025-10-22 05:34:05,2025-10-23 19:35:40,"Sublethall (Score: 9): Both hydraulic and electric power steering can be made stiff or light. It's by design. There's even adjustable ones that change based on driving mode selected or speed.   
Being  rack and pinion doesn't really have anything to do with it as both hydraulic and electric power steering can be used with it

Bomber_Man (Score: 7): Two possible reasons come to mind. First off it’s possible that with different ps valving and higher fluid line pressure the jeep simply puts more steering assist into its system offering up a lighter steering feel. This is actually very common in American truck-based setups. The lack of road feel is disconcerting for seasoned drivers, so definitely not an enthusiast setup. By contrast the bimmer opted for less parasitic loss through the pump to get better engine performance. 

The second reason could be down to suspension geometry. Particularly caster and Ackerman angles can have a dramatic effect on steering feel. Seeing as we’re comparing an SUV to a sports car the designs are pretty different from the get-go in this respect. Simply put the BMW prioritizes handling and driver feel, while the Jeep prioritizes profits for their board members, eh, I mean driver comfort.

EDIT: on a personal note both of my cars have manual steering racks. They feel pretty different to each other in terms of steering effort in different situations too. The only times I’ve felt I would like power steering is tight maneuvers in parking lots, otherwise it’s hardly noticeable.

Additionally the air drag on a hitch mounted cargo carrier is significantly less than a roof mounted carrier.  I’ve found that roof mounted cargo dramatically decreases gas mileage and significantly increases noise.  

Lastly, most car specs also limit roof load to 100 pounds. So you have similar limitations weight wise."

1od3of0,Damage Assessment - 2015 Ford Fiesta,"Hi All, first post here and I hope I’m in the right place. I’ve had my fiesta for around 5 years now and have never had a nick on it. 

However, recently the keys were locked inside with both mine and my girlfriend’s phones. It was late on a Sunday night and we were at a fairly rural petrol station.

Long story short, we were offered help by multiple locals, but as a result the car suffered some necessary damage. 

1. Initially an ambulance driver offered to smash the window so we could get the keys. Scarily that was unsuccessful but did leave some scratches on the window (minor damage and not what I’m really hearing to ask about). (Pic 4)

2. Eventually someone came along with wire and a screwdriver. They pried the door open and managed to eventually get the door opened using the door handle. 
This has resulted in some surface level scratches to the plastic by the windows and a small dent in the roof where the screwdriver was levered. (Pics 1-3)

Honestly, I’m not too bothered personally about the damage. The guys that helped saved my ass big time that night.

I was thinking recently of selling the car and getting something slightly bigger but I’m concerned that this damage will take a fair bit of value off.

Really I’m wondering:

How much value have a really lost here in terms of resale?

Would it be possible/worth it to get the damage repaired?
What would a reasonable price be for something like this.

Thanks for your help in advance!

1odf58i,Engine issues,"Hey everyone,

Recently I’ve been having a decent amount of issues with my 2018 Chevrolet trax. I bought the car in 2021 with 30k miles on it. It currently has just over 71k miles and I have been experiencing a clicking noise coming out of the engine. Sometimes the check engine light comes on and other times it doesn’t. Along with the check engine light it is also having a little bit of trouble accelerating. It seems almost like it’s hesitating to accelerate and the rpm goes up higher than normal.

I took it to a mechanic a couple weeks ago and told them the issues. They ended up replacing the knock sensor and my brakes. When I went to pick up my car I started driving away and the check engine light came on. I took the car back and said the issue was not resolved. They ended up calling me a couple hours later saying the car was fixed and that I could come pick the car up. Upon picking up the car, they asked me what my intentions were with the car. They told me to start the car 3 times and the noise will go away. Doesn’t seem like they fixed it to me and who tells a customer that. I ended up taking my car cause I needed it and they said it was safe to drive. Long story short I am bringing the car back in tomorrow because all of the symptoms are still going on and I have anxiety every time I have to drive.

C) could be some accessory is plugged in and draining the system, like a dashcam or something like that.

D) Very common-> You might have a faulty door lock module thats not reporting back to your security module that the door is locked. Without the vehicle knowing all the doors are locked, the security module doesn't clear the system for the cem to shut down.

F) some cars have a siren module with an internal battery as part of its antitheft system. When these batteries fail, they drain the system.

G) one of the relays on your car is frozen and stuck in the on position and needs to be replaced.

Go on YouTube. With a basic multi meter set to measure amp draw, you can easily figure out whether you have a parasitic draw or not. Then you can trace it down, by individually pulling fuses until your amp draw drops. Its not too hard and you can do it yourself if you have patience. You should be able to trace down the issue in an hour or two with help.

1ocz26t,Junkyard parts can save you hundreds but know what to avoid,"Junkyard parts are a great way to save money, but some things are worth buying new. Here's what's safe to get used and what isn't.

Body panels like doors, fenders, hoods, and bumpers are perfect junkyard parts. They're bolt-on and either work or don't. Check for rust and cracks before buying. Paint won't match unless you're repainting anyway. Can save hundreds compared to new.

Lights and lenses are fine if they're not cracked or foggy. Problem is many junkyard lights are yellowed or scratched. If they look decent, grab them since new lights are expensive.

Interior parts are great finds. Seats, door panels, trim pieces, center consoles. Check for stains, tears, and sun damage. If it looks good it's good since it's just cosmetic.

Wheels are solid purchases if not bent or cracked. Inspect carefully and check for wobbles. Curb rash is cosmetic but structural damage is a safety issue. Most yards let you roll them to check.

Electronics are a gamble. Radios, clusters, and modules might work perfectly or be dead. No way to fully test at the yard. Only buy if there's a return policy.

Never buy used airbags. Once deployed they're trash. Even undeployed ones are sketchy because their history is unknown. Safety items should always be new.

Avoid used suspension parts like struts, shocks, and ball joints. They're wear items and if a car is in a junkyard it probably wasn't well maintained. These are cheap enough new and critical for safety.

Engines and transmissions are major gambles. Some yards offer warranties which helps. But a junkyard motor could last years or die in a month. Low mileage totaled cars are best sources.

Bring tools to pull-it-yourself yards. Sockets, ratchets, screwdrivers. Wear clothes that can get dirty. Know your exact year and model since not all years interchange.

Check return policies before buying. Some yards have no returns, others give a few days. Get a receipt with part description.

Best finds are from newer totaled vehicles with recent accidents. Avoid cars that sat outside for years with rust and sun damage. The money saved is significant. New fender might be four hundred, junkyard could be fifty.",61,1761108334.0,20,autorepair,1761248140,2025-10-22 04:45:34,2025-10-23 19:35:40,"CameronsTheName (Score: 9): A good tip is to never buy an engine or gearbox from a wrecker if the car doesn't have obvious signs of damage.

If the car has no obvious reason why it's at the wrecker the engine or gearbox is likely the reason it's there. 

A junkyard doesn't test an engine or gearbox enough for them to say for sure it's good. They usually only run the car for a few minutes to get it off the tow truck into its final resting place.

I found out that it's the ""electronic throttle body/powertrain"" warning light. I had a friend scan it for codes but nothing showed up. The light came off once I turned the car off and on. That worked for a bit. Then it came on and surged everytime it hit 2 RPM's. No matter what. I didn't drive for a while because I didn't have money to get the car fixed and a family emergency has prevented me from working for a while. Anyways, had to get her jumped. Strange thing is, after that I took her for a spin and she ran beautiful. No wrench warning light. No surging. Check engine light stayed on though. But it did sound like there was a churning in the engine when I did drive. I didn't go far for fear of stalling. I guess I should've kept starting the car each day and that's my fault but I need a jump again.

Vacuum boosters have a check valve on them to hold the vacuum in the booster when the engine is turned off. It sounds like to me the check valve is possibly broken or not seated correctly, so when the engine turns off it sucks in air to fill the vacuum making that noise.

Check how the brakes feel after turning the engine off. Normally you should be able to depress the petal with little resistance at least 3 times. If you can’t the check valve has problems.

1odeotz,2011 Saab 9-5 NG Carplay Module,"I’m currently in the process of modernising my 2011 Saab 9-5 NG a little, while still keeping the car looking completely stock. Recently, I successfully upgraded the radio from DAB to DAB+ by installing an Opel DAB+ module, which integrates seamlessly into the Saab interface like it was factory (Saab went down under before GM deployed DAB+ in any cars).

Now I’ve come across these wireless CarPlay modules that connect between the radio unit and the factory screen, essentially “injecting” video and audio signals into the original hardware. As you might expect, there aren’t any modules made specifically for the 9-5 NG, but since the system is GM-based, I assumed there must be something close enough to work.

So I bought and installed a module designed for the Opel/Vauxhall Insignia A with the 7-inch NAVI900/950 screen. It does display the CarPlay interface correctly, but when I use the steering wheel or centre console buttons, the commands are sent both to CarPlay and to the original Saab interface running in the background. On top of that, there’s no audio output from the module at all.

That got me thinking: perhaps a module intended for the Cadillac SRX would be a better match. It also uses an 8-inch display like the Saab, and its infotainment architecture seems much closer to the 9-5 NG — especially since it’s closely related to the 9-4X. Has anyone tried this before or any idea how I could maybe get it to work with the Insignia module?",4,1761154062.0,6,CarHacking,1761248140,2025-10-22 17:27:42,2025-10-23 19:35:40,"bonecows (Score: 1): I checked on Aliexpress and seemed to find a few made for the 9-5, those wouldn't work?

1od5er0,Anyone else using phone overlays in older cars? Here's my Bluetooth setup,"Hey, so I've been driving a 2002 Acura RSX and finally installed a Kenwood DDX 7025BT to get Bluetooth. Still no Android Auto though.

Got frustrated trying to safely use my phone with maps while driving, so I built simple app with overlay (named SafeDrive Companion) that auto-launches when my phone connects to the Kenwood. Been using it for 3 months now and it works surprisingly well:

* Starts automatically when Bluetooth connects
* Quick shortcuts for maps/music/fav apps/messages
* Overlay doesn't cover navigation (this was huge for me)
* Brings nav back after calls interrupt it (or after closing other apps)
* No ads or data collection stuff

Does anyone else use their phone this way in older cars, or is this ""too niche""? Just curious if this kind of setup would even be useful for others.

Ever since then, the driving performance has decreased and sometimes it feels like it will stall out but doesn’t.

I’ve looked at what it could be online and a lot of people said to clean the MAF sensor, so I did that, but it only helped it for a day and went back to driving with decreased performance. I also replace air filters and still have the same problem.

I also noticed that whenever I am low on gas like a quarter or less it drives just like it used to, like it’s never had an acceleration problem. But when I put gas, that hesitation becomes 10x worse than how it was before I refilled my tank. I was thinking of cleaning my tank with Techron, but not sure what’s recommended for that.

1odlisd,250K mile Camry. Worth fixing?,"Long story short. I have a 2005 Toyota Camry 3.3 Liter V6 with 250K+ on the dash. I have had the car for 3 years and drove all up and down the South and East Coast on long trips. I purchased it at 204K miles for $2500 and over 3 years put about $3,000 into it replacing wear and tear items. I made sure to change the Oil every 4K miles consistently. As of now the car runs OK but the Trans is a little rough when shifting from Park to Drive. I took it to mechanic for inspection since it hit 250K and this is what he told me needs to replaced.

2) 1x Engine Strut Torque Mount $239
3)Valve Cover Gasket (both banks) $464
4)Engine Thermostat + coolant $245
5)Front and rear brakes + Rotors $778

1odkiq7,"Aftermarket 56.1 wheels are loose on my 2025 Impreza hub, not sure why, how bad is this?","Hi all,

I just tried fitting a set of new aftermarket steel wheels on my 2025 Subaru Impreza Touring. They slide onto the hub but feel loose, whereas the OEM aluminum wheels fit perfectly.

Both wheels are hub-centric and nominally 56.1 mm, but when I measured with a caliper:

* OEM wheels: about 55.6 mm
* New wheels: about 56.1 mm

The difference is only about 0.5 mm in diameter, so the new wheels are slightly “lug-centric,” relying on the conical lug nuts to center them.

I’m concerned about long-term safety, vibrations, and uneven stress on the studs. I also can’t find hub-centric rings small enough to reduce the 56.1 mm bore to match my hub.

Would it be safer to return these aftermarket wheels and buy OEM wheels instead for a snug fit, or is this small difference generally considered acceptable?

It speeds up when the engine revs up, happens in a small specific part of the combustion chamber, and happens more often the bigger the engine is (4 cylinder, V6, V8, etc). If you detonate the fuel too early or too late you can cause serious damage to the engine, including literally blowing it up. You could use that info in this case, with a low roll the player could fail to make the car run. You could lower the stakes and make it run slowly rather than completely break if they roll badly.

Besides 1st gear, the car is accelerating normally with appropriate rpms, the pedal isn't sticking but I dont really feel the plates engaging anymore (gripping/don't feel that bite), the bite point seems to be lower to the floor now than before, very rarely have trouble shifting into gear, stick feels looser than before.

Think of what would happen if you were accelerating and lightly pressed the clutch pedal.  The RPMs would shoot up, and the car would stop accelerating.  If you removed that clutch pedal pressure, the RPMs would quickly drop, and the car would resume accelerating.  That is basically what happens when a clutch slips.

We dropped it off yesterday.
Fast forward to today when they call and say it'll cost $1200 as the driver's seat needs a new memory control module. I said forget the seat, just fix the odometer - she says its all tied in together and they both have to be done to be fixed. 😅 Also, they said they couldn't open the lift gate AT ALL and wanted another chunk to fix that issue too (it worked before we dropped it off, the button inside doesn't and hasn't worked for a while, but you can still physically open it). Anyway, I said fine to the seat/odometer. 10 mins later I called back and said forget it. I'll come get it. And I asked why a proxi alignment wouldn't fix the issue. She said well yes, we have to do that too, but the seat won't work without the part.

He lifted the truck up and ran it for a while but couldn’t find the source. 

Here’s what I see: a small spot of fluid (4-8”) under the drivers side when the car sits overnight (about 12 hours) fluid is fluorescent yellow and tastes sweet (I know I’m not supposed to taste it. I only did it once and washed my mouth out right after). This happens every night. It does not seem to do this when the car sits while I’m at work (roughly 11 hours). I drive it about 20 miles each way to and from work 5 days a week. If the temperature gauge on the dash is a scale from 1-10, it sits at about a 5 when I’m driving on the freeway and gets up to about 6.5 when driving surface streets.

I have a 2011 VW Golf with stock aluminum rims and 148,000 miles. I had a coolant leak at the water pump that was diagnosed and two weeks later replaced under warranty by the mechanic that had done my timing belt and water pump under two years ago. Meanwhile, my car needed tires, so because it was already just siitting waiting for a water pump, I ran it a mile across town to a tire center to get the tires done. They recommended an alignment and I approved the work. Picked up the car from the tire center  and drove home. A week later my mechanic had the car for the water pump replacement. While doing the work, he noticed a low tire and diagnosed a leaking bead on the new tires. I picked up my car and took it directly to the tire center and let them know. They said it would be no problem and that they would reseal the tires to the rims and give it back that day. They resealed my tires and I picked up my car which suddenly had a vibration. Ran it out on the highway for 1/2 a mile and turned around and returned to the tire shop. One of their shop mechanics rode with and said it must be an out of balance tire (they balanced them twice, once for each install). The mechanic rebalanced the tires and brought the car back and immediately drove it on the lift instead of handing me the key. Put it on the lift and gave it gas and it became apparent that the front right wheel was the culprit immediately. They told me it was a bad tire and that they'd order a new one. I didn't believe that. They decided to pull the rim off the car when I immediately saw a bend in the rim. Definitely the cause. 

TLDR; how does a rim get bent while changing tires? They have accepted responsibility and are replacing the rim, but do not agree that they did it at this time.

This year, since last years MOT, he’s done 7k miles, and it passed first time, with quite a few advisories again, most being from last years.

Posting on here as I'm really not sure what to do :(

So, I own a 2008 Manual Subaru WRX with 119,000 kms on the engine currently (give or take).

Around 2 weeks ago, I went on a drive (hour-long), turned off my car for roughly 2.5 hours, and when I went to start the car again, it no longer turned on.

The car now turns and cranks, but doesn't start. It quite literally sounds like it's smoked a 10 pack.

I've checked my fuel pump and the lines to see if there is any pressure in it, which there was. My battery is completely charged and connected a-ok. I haven't changed my battery recently either.

The roadside assist did spray 'start ya bastard' spray, and that didn't do anything at the time. At first, I was thinking coil packs or spark plugs, but highly unlikely they would all go at once, especially after it was driving ok beforehand.

All my major fuses (fuel pump, starter, etc) weren't blown and look ok.

I did a bit of research and asked some family and friends, and was told about the immobiliser. I've never really had to deal with immobilisers, so I was going into this completely blind. The immobiliser does flash red every couple of seconds, but I'm guessing that's just to say that it's turned on? There is a little key sign that flashes red every 3-4 seconds on the dash as well, only when my key is NOT in the ignition barrel. When it is in, it doesn't flash at all.

I also saw in someone else's post that it could be a potential flat key battery. I did change my battery, and the car acted like it would start and then went back to the usual cranking, though the plus side is that all my doors lock when I turn the ignition now.

I've only ever had one key, the main key, so I'm not sure if the immobiliser just isn't recognising the key anymore or something like that?

I tried to re-sync the key by turning the ignition ""off and on"" multiple times, but with no luck.

I don't know if it has anything to do with the immobiliser anymore, and I'll take quite literally ANY ideas or thoughts on what I should do.

Generally speaking, the wise owner did those items by around 100k, and also the water pump for good measure (while it was all apart). If done right, you may not have to worry about those items again.

Now maybe your problem isn't that. But if it is, I fear you may be on the WRX road of despair. The immobilizer-related indicators don't seem to fit the puzzle though.

Running perfectly normal before oil change, no leaks or issues. 

Looking for some help understanding what’s going on.

Monday morning I got an oil change before starting a 1,000-mile road trip. About 300 miles into the trip, several warning lights came on — AWD malfunction, ICS malfunction, low oil pressure, and check engine. I pulled over and saw a large oil leak underneath.

Had the car towed to a local shop and stayed overnight. The mechanic there said there was no gasket on the oil filter, so the place that did the oil change either forgot to install it or didn’t tighten it properly and it came off. They replaced the filter, added oil, and said everything looked fine.

The car ran perfectly for about 200 miles, then the exact same issue happened again — same warning lights, oil leaking underneath, and I had to get it towed and stay overnight again.

Could the first incident (running low or out of oil) have caused lasting engine damage that’s now leading to another leak? Or is it more likely something was still installed incorrectly?

I’m currently stranded overnight at another motel, and can’t sleep because I’m so anxious about the whole situation. Any insight or suggestions on what I should ask the shop to check in the morning would be really appreciated.

Everything came back green except for pads and rotors, and the water pump had a leak in it. He said all three repairs would be $3,600. Seemed legit for those three things. Brakes still had 3mm of pad on them, so I specifically declined the pads and rotors, and he quoted me a new price just for the purge valve and water pump, bringing the total down to about $2,400. Seemed high, but I know the engine has to come off for the water pump, so I went ahead and agreed to it. Asked him about financing, agreed to a down payment, and authorized the work on it. I go to pick it up today, and the brake pads and rotors were repaired and charged on top of the other repairs after I specifically declined the work for the brakes over the phone. Now the dealer still wants the $3,600 that I physically do not have. The advisor called it ""a misunderstanding"" and said that when he ran the financing through, that he did it for everything.

I own a 2009 Hyundai Santa Fe. Today, while I was driving, one of the radiator hoses popped off. I didn’t notice any fluids leaking right away, but I did see smoke coming from the front passenger side under the hood. I had the car towed to a mechanic, who replaced the radiator hose.

After testing the car, the mechanic said fluids started leaking again — this time from the thermostat housing. He replaced the thermostat housing but mentioned that there still seems to be too much pressure in the system, and everything got wet again.

He said it might be a pressure issue, but I’m unsure what else could be causing the problem.

1odhjoh,Semi long term mechanic out of work. Need advice!!,"I'm a mechanic with 6 years experience in the field and 18 months school. it may not be much but hear me out. I've been out of work for like 3 months now looking for a new shop to work in. I'm based in NYC and the shop I was working at primarily only worked on taxi cabs and Amazon/ citibike vans; this isnt the type of shop I saw myself working at long term. Now I'm more selective about the jobs I apply to because I do not want to move from shop to shop as this is even unfair to the shops themselves. I just want to grow at one good shop.
At first there were a few jobs posted that I responded to and got responses back. The issue is that a lot of shops are demanding 10-15-20 years experience.
Or do not want to pay the salary for the demand in hours and skill.
I just want to know a few things and gain clarity on them to further help my endeavors in finding a job.
Because it may turn out that l've been full of myself this whole time.
Am I wrong to think that shops are incorrect in demanding 10 or more years experience?. The way I see it is a lot of independents and franchises only want a worker and don't want to invest into the tech at all.
I've even stated during interviews that I continue to study and expand my knowledge all the time. I mean, I'm far from green. I can do everything except rebuild a motor or trans and l've never done a timing chain. But my diag and electrical skills are on point including reading a diagram. Which leads to my next question.
Do shops not care that I went to school or that I can read a diagram and follow specs and instructions or am I being slightly arrogant?
I mean I have to start from somewhere and believe the shops are being unfair in judging my skill based off of my schooling and age. Even going as far as brushing my schooling off as a non contender. It's a little defeating at this point. When I put 6 years into this. It's
not a lot I know. But for me it's 6 dedicated years and even my instructors got tired of me at one point.
I'm 31 years old and while I have no kids nyc is still expensive with studios starting at 2k on the low end.
Right now a job called me back and said he was looking for a guy to work 6 days a week for $700. Am I out of my mind for saying no to that? I'm not a guy with 20 years but I believe I am worth much more than that.
But on the other hand I really need a job and feel that maybe I'm being ungrateful. I just don't want to accept anything because I really need it.
What salary should I be asking for at this point in my career? Am I being arrogant and ungrateful in thinking I'm worth more? Should I go back to school and change careers completely? That kind of where I am right now.

Generally a dealer shop will value having several years of formal schooling and verifiable continuous employment at one shop since it indicates you are a reliable worker that shows up every day.   Point out in your interviews that you are not afraid of electrical- that is usually a skill that tis difficult to find in a new employee.

Up until the last few years dealerships wanted an automotive degree to fill starting tech positions, but the shortage of qualified techs has worsened to the point where many of them are hiring people with little to no formal training and sending them to factory training classes if they show promise.

A dealer may want to start you out in a lube or tire bay despite you having more experience than that position requires but it is a foot in the door and gives you some income right now.    If you impress them by doing quality work in under flat rate time so you are producing money for the shop then they will likely want to throw some other jobs, like brake and chassis service at you to see how you do.    Also, an important quality in a tech is having the ability to spot other needed work so they can sell it- oil chang services do not make much money for the shop, selling other needed work during that service is the goal.   What you do not want to do is be over confident, as in presenting yourself as if you know everything about car repair.    Even if you think you do, the reality is that what you do not know is far greater than you realize at this point.    I've been doing this for 40+ years, am a shop manager and lead diagnostic tech at a busy modern shop, am a program advisor to 2 technical schools, and I learn new things every day.    What you know after 6 years on the job is a good start, but be careful to not come across as overconfident and a know it all- instead present your self as having experience and a skill level that will start making the shop money immediately and a willingness to learn more.     Those guys that come in to interviews clai=ming to be car wizards that know everything (I've interviewed my share of them) are invariably the ones that get in over their head and constantly break stuff in actual practice.

ASE certs, and state vehicle safety and emissions inspector licenses are a huge plus if required where you live.    You have enough experience to be able to take a couple basic ASE tests (brakes and steering/ suspension are probably the easiest), most independent shops and some dealer shops will see that as proof of your skills and also that you are motivated and want to be a professional.  A section 609 refrigerant handling certification is very easy to get for about $25 online (MACS.org) and some employers will value that, especially the fact that you were motivated enough to get one.     A letter of recommendation from the instructors where you went to school, or from your previous employer or shop manager is a plus when presented along with your resume.   having any or all of these things when you walk in to an interview puts you a whole level above 90% of the other candidates for the job.

IDK what pay rates are in a metropolitan area like NYC, but I assume they would be higher than where I live in rural central PA.     In my area entry level guys working in tire stores and lube bays generally are in the $15/hr range to start, and anyone doing tech work should be starting out in the $20/hr  + range at least.   Keep in mind you are not going to be offered top dollar until you have proved yourself, but starting pay should be enough to at least pay your basic bills.

One thing the is very important to most employers is that you have a fairly complete tool set- if you have been at this for 6 years I assume you do.    It's kind of a standard requirement for a tech position almost anywhere.    It might impress an employer if you were to ask for a copy of their required tool list during an interview to make sure you have everything required on your first day.

Something to keep in mind is that employers are evaluating what you can do to generate money for the shop, and if you are a reliable and dependable employee that is going to show up on time (or even a few minutes early) every day.   Talking too much about what you want from them can be a turn off; talk instead about what skills you can bring to the place that will earn money for them, and how you can complete work quickly and accurately without comebacks.  Let them know you realize time is money, and that you are expected to meet the shop's production goal for your position every day.  That is what an employer wants to hear.    A professional resume is very helpful; even if you do not get the job this time most employers keep on file resumes of candidates that impress them and you may get a call later if the first guy doesn't work out."

1odn3yz,Convertible dilemma?,"Hi all, 

I am currently in search on a two seater convertible. I've owned a couple of z3s and a 3.0 si e85 z4 in the past. I have really enjoyed them although I currently own a 130I which covers the 6 cylinder side of things nicely. The convertible would be an addition and although I love BMWs I fancy trying something else as they may be too similar to the 130i. I have considered Mr2s, mx-5s, 986 boxster, 350z  convertible or another z3. The mk3 MR2 is currently my stand out contender as it's cheap, different to my 130i, less prone to rust than the mx-5 and different engine placement to what I've experienced. 

What should I do?? I can't make a decision and some input would be good if you have had some of the cars on the list or been in a similar situation. I have around £4k to spend so obviously the mk3 MR2 is appealing as I'd also have money left over but it may feel a bit slow for me.

Sakers92 (Score: 2): Hi, without a diagnostic check, its always a bit of a guess over the Internet but:


Your corsa gets the speed from the ABS wheel speed sensors which measure MPH.


The ABS computer then sends this speed to the instrument cluster on your dash, where your speedometer is. The bit you look at.


If there are no ABS warning lights on the dashboard, then chances are the wheel speed sensors are all ok, otherwise there would be an orange fault light on permanently.


This leaves 2 options, the instrument cluster is faulty, or the signal wire BETWEEN the instrument cluster and the ABS computer is broken or damaged.


There are other very rare, and very unlikely possibilities but from a blind diagnosis, what i listed are the most likely issues.

10A fuse: there isn't one for the speed sensor alone if I remember correctly, the fuse will be for the FULL instrument cluster, if the fuse was blown, there would be other things not showing up, or the whole thing wouldnt turn on, its unlikely to be this, but no harm trying anyway.

Before i even begin, i’m going to put my hands up in the air and say that I didn’t even bother looking inside the bonnet. 2 days ago on the 20th october i bought a KIA RIO, did the test drive the day prior. As we drove off from the dealership the engine was really noisy and i could see from my back camera that it was smoking excessively. We took it straight to our friend who is a mechanic and he said that there is a coolant leak and a potential timing chain issue (TBC). I call up big motoring world the next day and email and they tell me to take it to KIA since i still have KIA Warranty however KIA isnt free until december. This made us think- its a 2022 car it really shouldn’t be having any issues we just don’t want it. I email them saying i reject the purchase and that i don’t want it but they are saying that they need to inspect it and that will only happen on the 4th November. It’s going to be in Kent and i’m based in london so they said i can use RAC to recover it to wimbledon. They have not outright accepted my rejection. They said that they want to inspect it and see what they can do but i’m really nervous because they are longing this out and making this harder than it is. FYI after i found about the coolant leak i searched up the MOT records and it says that a coolant leak was recovered when the last MOT took place on the 14th october LOL.

Falken make very good tyres at a good price, but only replace it if you're keeping the car.

As for your specific questions:

1od2o30,Advice needed re: faulty window switch.,"Bought a car from Arnold Clark last week. I’d heard mixed things about them, but after a bad private sale a few years ago, I wanted the security of a proper warranty.

Found a low-mileage Dacia Duster — a few dents but otherwise good. Since I only drive about 20 miles a week, it seemed perfect. The car was at a branch 20 minutes away, and they wanted £150 to move it, so I just took a taxi there instead. Viewed it, bought it, and collected it the next day after a clean.

When I picked it up, I noticed the air-con/heater only worked on full blast. The service team had gone home, so I was told to come back. Next day, they diagnosed a blown resistor, replaced it, and it worked fine.

A few days later, the driver’s window wouldn’t go up. The switch wasn’t illuminated either. I called Arnold Clark and was told they couldn’t look at it for two days. I had to tape a bin bag over the window in the meantime.

I work with circuit boards, so I removed the switch, found corrosion, and partially fixed it with contact cleaner—but it failed again soon after. When I finally took it in, I told them it was definitely the switch and even gave them the part number. Later, they said it was the window motor assembly instead and that the selling branch needed to approve the repair.

So it was £1100 for the egr, about £300 labour and £800 for the part as he said they cannot find anywhere else but from Vauxall themselves and is a 7-10 day lead time.

Around £600 for the air con, which again the worry would be it failing out a place from what I understand.

If I recall it has like 83k or so miles on the clock and we have sunk quite a bit into it in the 8 years we have had it. Now the dilemma is do we keep it?

* If this part is so hard to get will others be in the future

WHERES_MY_SWORD (Score: 1): Assume you want nearly new, as you can definitely get an R in good nick for under 20k… Other than that, GTI, maybe Yaris GR? Type-R also an option at that price but they hold their value so it’ll be older and higher mileage than the others.

Demeter_Crusher (Score: 1): Plenty of good EVs under £20k. They won't be meaningfully cheaper to run unless you can charge on domestic-rate electricity though. At £20k you'd be able to get one with plenty of range so they should meet almost any use-case requirement."
1ocvwlm,American here- currently work for Porsche in Finance,"Hello all, 

A little background - my stepfather for over 30 years is English , and I spent every summer growing up as a young child and teenager in Italy and the UK. I come from a very Anglo-American background. I am very familiar with the UK and life there. HOWEVER, I know the car business is very different in the UK than in America. 

I am married with a 3 year old and a 1 year old. My wife and I have discussed moving to the UK in both serious and non - serious (sure one day) kind of conversations. 

I have worked for my current dealer group in the US for close to 10 years. I have done sales for Audi, then went to do Finance Manager there for a few years and have been with Porsche as a finance manager and really a sales manager for what I have to do for now for 5 years. 

I understand car sales is very different in the UK, and that the income potential is different- but so are living costs and the standards of living in general. While I hate to discuss money, let’s be honest it’s important, I’ve done very well in the states usually garnering anywhere from 250-300K USD annually. I am very good at what I do- I won’t be too bashful here. My PVR is always north of 3K in finance for my group and I usually net them around a million a year in “back end” gross. 

My question is several folds- 1) is there the same opportunity in the UK? 2) generally what would a UK based dealer think of hiring an American , given our way of buying cars 3)  not withstanding our current disdain for some of the state of affairs over here, would a move like that be worth it based on the answers of #1 and #2? 

Thanks in advance. ",0,1761098692.0,15,CartalkUK,1761248140,2025-10-22 02:04:52,2025-10-23 19:35:40,"BaldyBaldyBouncer (Score: 9): An equivalent job in the UK will pay £40 to £60k depending on commission. Living costs are slightly less but not a quarter.

There's absolutely no way you wouldn't be significantly worse off financially moving to the UK and that's IF you get a visa which is becoming increasingly difficult.

Your biggest issue is getting a visa. Are you entitled to work in the UK? Your step father being British wouldn’t help you unless you are adopted and you all lived in the UK at the time of adoption. Assuming that’s not the case.

I would study up on the capital markets and find an agent, for investment oriented work in London. They always need data analysts."
