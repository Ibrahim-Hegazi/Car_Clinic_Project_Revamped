1oxce9d,need some advice on recent repairs,"

i drive a 2012 Jeep Wrangler Sport and my issues with it started last year. in november 2024, the temperature gauge started to fluctuate while i was driving, going towards hot and then dropping back down to the middle of this was also accompanied by no heat and a fan noise under the hood. 

i took it into my normal mechanic who charged me around 400, claiming it was a faulty thermostat sensor box (from what i remember). it worked fine for about a month before the same issues started coming back. we took it into the same mechanic who charged me another 400 dollars, this time saying it was some hose they had to change.

by this time, it was getting warm out and so the heating wasn’t really being turned on so it worked fine until last month when it started getting cold in my area again. it started having the EXACT same issue(fluctuating temperature gauge, fan noise under hood, no heat). 

we took it to the same mechanic again who replaced the thermostat box (again?) and replaced the water pump again, charging me over a thousand dollars. it worked for two days before the same issues started happening again! 

this has been a absolute nightmare and it sucks because usually this mechanic is really good and reliable but i’m starting to think differently now. because now, they’re saying it’s a head gasket issue and it’s going to be three thousand dollars, with no offer of a refund for the three previous misdiagnoses. 

and i barely drove it when it was having these issues each time and this engine was brand new with only two thousand miles on it when i bought it a year ago from the previous owner, 12k value. so i don’t know how it could be a head gasket issues especially when it isn’t having the other symptoms of a blown head gasket. even the guy who’s been working on my jeep didn’t sound super sure on the phone that that was even the problem!

what should i do? can i dispute the recent thousand dollar charge on my credit card for being misdiagnosed? does it sound like they’ve been ripping me off? does this sound like a head gasket issue on a new engine with less than 20,000 miles on it or something else? should i try to go elsewhere? the dealership? 

please help bc im very poor and i cant be spending more money on a vehicle im still making payments on.

I replaced the def injector due to a different code, which has since gone away, and this has come back in its place.

RockAuto for sure sells bundles with a 4 rotors and pads.  I imagine the other retailers do as well.  RockAuto is my go-to for parts when I have time to wait for them.  You can get a discount code for 5% off your order at r/RockAuto.

Check to see if the bundle you order includes a hardware kit.  If it's not included, I would advise buying that separately.  The hardware kit has new anti-rattle clips to replace the old ones, which are likely heat-stressed and starting to corrode.  You will need kits for the front and for the rear.  Replacing the caliper pins is optional, but I would replace them if the car is used in an area where they salt the roads in winter.  You'll also need some high temperature brake parts lubricant, which you can get online or buy local.

You probably don't need drilled and slotted rotors.  Standard solid rotors are probably what came with the car and will be just fine.  Your pads are most likely ceramic, which tend to be the most quiet."

You remove the wheel, all of the brake components, unplug the wheel speed sensor and undo the axle nut.

I always charged a recycling fee, which helped compensate my time for when I had to take everything to the recycle center or return the cores.

It can be a good move. But it won't be a fun move. I eventually went industrial and turned my back entirely on the auto industry with zero regret.

Are there combustibles in the antifreeze?   Get yourself a cheap [Combustion Leak Detector](https://www.oreillyauto.com/detail/c/lisle/lisle-combustion-leak-detector/lis0/75500).  This IS definitive.  If the color changes, you've got a problem that 99% of the time will be a head gasket.

Drain your oil ... Is there antifreeze or water when it separates?  Again if there is antifreeze, this is a definitive sign the head gasket is most likely blown.

I say most likely and 99% because there ARE outliers like cracked head, cracked block etc etc ..

1ox25y2,Help - is car safe to drive with brake sounds?,"https://reddit.com/link/1ox25y2/video/s4i0o5zb891g1/player

Hello, I have a 2014 mazda cx5 that recently had some suspension work done (Control Arms and Tie Rods). After getting it back, there was a quick inspection that said everything else looks good, but the front brakes were getting worn and should get replaced in a few months after some more driving.

Right after that, when I got the car back, I noticed some rattling sound coming from the driver side (where the fixes were done) and just continued to monitor it. I tried not using the car for a few days, and just yesterday (only a few days after the fix), there is this very loud high-ish pitched squealing sound when braking and even louder when letting the foot go. I assumed this was the brake indicators but I am confused as it sounds way louder and slightly different than what I think they normally sound like, and the brakes were just checked to still have some life in them (by multiple shops too since I got an alignment somewhere else). They also don't squeal otherwise.

I am wondering if it could be another issue other than brake pads, and if it seems to still be safe to drive? I have attached 2 things, the first being the sounds I get when braking and letting go, the second being the completed job picture where I noticed that the dust shield seems to have been pushed into the rotor (possible cause of rattling sound?) and that the brake pads honestly seem pretty low.

I have to drive over 30 miles to work and back in the afternoon, and was wondering if this was safe in the mean time.

I checked the battery, but it is almost always nearly full when this happens.

So, long story short, I need to charge the 12V on the dead Prius with my working one. The dead battery is actually pretty new, it's just been sitting in a dead car for a few months.

1ox0rqn,"Proof that Hyundai, Genesis, and Kia SP‑IV‑RR ATF (00232‑19052 / UM014‑CH065) are identical","I wanted to confirm that Hyundai, Genesis, and Kia really do share the *exact same* automatic transmission fluid (ATF) across different part numbers.

I own a 2018 Genesis G80 3.8 RWD, which requires **Hyundai 00232‑19052 (SP‑IV‑RR ATF)**. I wanted to stick with Hyundai OEM fluid during an ATF drain and fill, but noticed Kia’s SP‑IV‑RR was cheaper. That raised the question: are they truly identical?

Here’s the proof:

* The **2017–2020 Genesis G90 (HI)** uses **Hyundai 00232‑19052** ATF. Both the 3.3T V6 and 5.0 V8 versions run the **A8TR1 transmission**.
* The **2014–2018 Kia K900 (KH)** also uses the **A8TR1 transmission**, but Kia specifies **UM014‑CH065 (SP‑IV‑RR ATF)**.
* Since these cars share the *same transmission*, and each brand’s TSB lists its own ATF part number, this is definitive proof that **00232‑19052 and UM014‑CH065 are the same fluid** — just branded differently.

Supporting TSBs (NHTSA.gov):

As for what I think of V8... which one 430 or 460?

Generally, you can get used to the looks, in person it grows over time. Initially, it looks very dated, but the lines are kind of classy and if you squint, from further away it may even look like W213.

The platform is generally solid, little bit of rust around rear subframe, the interior and tech very dated (last production car to fit cassette player), but also in some cases unusually modern (like one in the picture has ACC, which was very rare for the ear, most GS430/460 also have it standard).

GS430 is really kind of an obsolete design, lazy gearbox and not that much power for displacement, just a comfortable cruiser. GS460 is a proper sleeper, 8-speed gearbox (first used in GS460), a lot more powerful engine, almost disguised IS-F... sadly they sold so few that price is also like IS-F."

Title says it all, it's so bad I've been having CO poisoning symptoms. I took it to 3 different shops and they all said the exhaust is good and I just need a new muffler. I got a new muffler and while it sounds a bit better, it still sounds like I have an exhaust leak somewhere, and even worse, the exhaust smell in the cabin issue is still not resolved! Here's a few other things I notice with the car:

\- VERY strong exhaust smell outside the car when idling, kinda goes away after a few minutes but the first minute or so is unbearable. it sometimes shakes, especially when the A/C is on.

\- car is not accelerating as fast as it used to. If I'm stopped at a light it takes a while to get to 20-30km/hr but once it's past that range it's usually better. Nothing super significant but it takes a few seconds more getting up to speed while everyone else passes me. this COULD be a transmission issue but I'm inclined to believe it's the engine in this case because of all the other stuff happening..

\- When I cruise at low speeds (like ahead of a red light) the tachometer arrow goes down a bit then back up then down again. maybe this is normal i don't really know

\- The exhaust smell in the cabin is mostly noticeable when my fan is on. If my fan is off I only notice it on the highway if I'm going really fast.

\- I like to warm up the car a bit before I start driving it because I noticed a difference between driving it cold vs driving it after it's had a chance to warm up, but it needs a LONG time to get to 600RPM, like 15 mins.. maybe it's the cold winter temp? I thought I'd mention that too in case it helps.

\- It's happened to me a couple of times before where i go to press the gas pedal and it feels heavy, like there's a resistance of some sort.

I need a car for city driving and frequent trips on the highway, but I drive very calmly and never faster than 120 km/h. My budget is 4,000 €. Cosmetic details do not matter to me; what matters is technical reliability and low maintenance costs.

2. What should I pay attention to when buying, for example during the test drive, TÜV check, or when reviewing the documents?

I got a message indicating a power steering fault, service immediately. I stopped the car shortly afterwards. I turned it off and back on and then pretty much lost all power steering. According to Google and a YouTube video, it's the Electric Powered Steering Rack that went out. I've seen a wide range of prices to get it fixed but generally the part is about $1,200 from my understanding. Total install would be about $1,600+. I've seen some up to over $2,000. On top of that, I've been having an issue with Cylinder 2 misfiring and a coolant issue where it's being burned up in the engine block. My mechanic did a head gasket test, but that turned out to be good. After that test I've had to fill up the puke tank 2 more times, and every once in a while I still smell the burning of coolant. The car has some cosmetic damages to it as well that in general would devalue the vehicle if everything was working anyways. I love this car honestly I do, I've had it for a little over 7 years with no major issues.

On the other hand, my Dad has an older car that he's willing to sell me. It's a 2002 Lincoln LS, I don't know the mileage. He's a mechanic as well and has said that everything with the car is in good working order. He lives out of my state so he wouldn't be able to fix my Fusion. He said he'd sell me the Lincoln for $1,500. I'm heading down to him on the 26th, so in the mean time I'd have to get a rental vehicle, which would cost me about $250 from the 17th through the 26th.

When my car broke down last night, the tow truck driver offered to buy my fusion for $1,000 as well. I did tell him about the coolant issue and he said he didn't care as he would do an engine swap anyways.

Also, I have two kids, 1yo and 5yo and I live in Minnesota so I'd need a decent vehicle for snow, but I really don't know anything about the Lincoln line.

I’ve been comparing hybrids and full EVs lately, and honestly, both camps make solid arguments — but practicality really depends on how you actually use your car.

**EVs are amazing** if you have easy access to charging. They’re smooth, quiet, cheap to run, and you never have to deal with gas stations. But the higher upfront price, range anxiety, and the reality that charging infrastructure is still inconsistent in many places make them less convenient for long-distance or rural drivers.

**Hybrids**, meanwhile, feel like the realistic middle ground. You get better fuel economy, lower emissions, and none of the stress about where the next charger is. They’re usually cheaper than EVs too. The downside is that you’re still tied to gasoline and you miss out on the full electric driving experience.

[EV or Hybrid — What Makes More Sense](https://preview.redd.it/ffiuzkt6m61g1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4dd17e7d341c2f93148d6c59358e6d629b6ce70)

Personally, I think **EVs are more practical for city or suburban life**, especially if you can charge at home. But for people who travel long distances, live in apartments, or don’t want to rely on public chargers, **hybrids still make way more sense right now**.",6,1763108353.0,11,automotive,1763235184,2025-11-14 08:19:13,2025-11-15 19:33:04,"Alf_4_Prez (Score: 2): Dependant on lifestyle really.

The air will become cleaner and the city will become quieter.

Do you live out on the countryside, with 15 minutes to the closest gas station? Then perhaps an EV is a net loss. The grass isn't exactly turning brown as you drive by, the trees deaden all sound from your engine, and on the wide open roads having a big car with a big tank, easily able to carry people or equipment over long distance is essential.

1owzjpe,Developing a motorsport-style gear display - Part 3,"I'm developing a gear display. It reads OBD2 speed and RPM and calculates the gear ratio to show the current gear. The display is already showing the gears, but there is still a lot of work to do. I also made a CAD model and I'm thinking about 3D-printing my first prototype.

This week I ran into a strange problem. Sometimes my car won't start if I have the display plugged into the OBD2 port, and I don't know why this happens .If I start the car first and only plug in the OBD2 later, there is no problem.

Right now my code does this: If there is no data on the CAN bus for 5 seconds, I go into STOP mode. When I detect any data on the bus, I wake up and immediately start sending OBD2 requests. 

I have another question: while in STOP mode my display is using about 5 mA. The OBD2 port is always powered, so this current comes directly from the car battery. Do you think 5 mA is okay for an always-connected device, or is that already too much and I should try to reduce it more?

Thanks",3,1763134165.0,8,CarHacking,1763235184,2025-11-14 15:29:25,2025-11-15 19:33:04,"Right_Painter9677 (Score: 2): Hi, I want to tell you that it's too much because at work we aim for uA range.

I know that some products that drain only 15mA kill the customers battery but how much of time it need idk.

WestonP (Score: 2): I sell a couple OBD-connected products, and have been through these headaches before...

I'd like to see less than 5 mA in sleep, but I also wouldn't call that excessive. A 5 mA load is not preventing your car from starting, nor is it draining a healthy battery in any reasonable amount of time, so there must be something else going on. Maybe starting the car is causing your device to reset and disrupt the CAN bus at that time? I have seen that before, and had to design my stuff so that the CAN transceiver is pulled inactive during power-up, otherwise it would cause errors on the bus for an instant when it was plugged in or reset (and that is super common with hobbyist CAN circuits/boards).

I had an early prototype that was drawing 33 mA all the time with no sleep mode, which is certainly not ideal, but also not enough to be a near-term problem for starting a vehicle that is driven somewhat regularly. What it did do, however, was contribute to the gradual death of the battery, where it became harder to start... If you let it discharge below 11.8V or so, you'll reduce the capacity of the battery a little each time. It took about 6 months to show symptoms, and the battery was old to begin with. So yeah, 33 mA is obviously bad, like we already knew, but also not an immediate problem.

My products in production are advertised as drawing under 2 mA in sleep mode, but in reality they're closer to half that. While engineering perfectionists will want to optimize to the uA range (which adds complications, headaches, and costs), the reality is that this is already a negligible amount for a vehicle, and its own systems will be drawing far more. You'll also find that many other OBD products on the market draw much more, and some even lack a sleep mode entirely... I've personally seen the 50 mA range, and have heard of up to 80 mA. I don't consider those levels anywhere near acceptable, but it's what's out there and why people can be quick to blame OBD-connected devices.

Customer perception on this is super wonky, too... You'll have people running the big-drain devices and saying everything's great, not realizing that's why they need a battery a few months later, meanwhile the low-drain devices are getting falsely accused for cars not starting and such just because they have a dim LED lit. My best reputation/quality competitor advertises 1.8 mA in sleep and 39 mA while active, while I'm at 1.4 mA in sleep and 23 mA active... Both of us are well below most others, but I'll still have people trying to tell me that it drained their battery. Turns out that the vehicle hadn't been driven in months, my device wasn't even plugged in during that time, and now they've come back and had a problem when they plugged it back in... Obviously the device had nothing to do with it, but it's the first thing to get blamed. I offer something simple they can try, and it miraculously solves the problem, but in reality they just drove the car and recharged their battery from all that time it had been sitting. Meanwhile, I've had these installed in all of my vehicles for several years now without any issue, because I had designed it for this.

Pubelication (Score: 2): If it's for your own use then calculate how long it would take to drain 1/3 capacity and how often you drive. If you drive it daily or every other day, even a higher draw (like park mode dash cams have) won't matter. But if you only drive once a couple weeks, that draw can become an issue."

1owx09s,Displaying in EV: Sensor Data.,"Hey everyone, I’m a student working on an electric vehicle conversion project and I’m a bit stuck.  
I’m doing the computer/electrical engineering part, and right now I’m trying to figure out how to collect live data from the car and show it on a dashboard inside the vehicle.

We’re using an **Alltrax AC1 motor controller (VCU)**. I can connect it to a laptop with the Alltrax Toolkit software and see some live data like RPM, voltage, amps, etc. But I need to build **my own dashboard** using a microcontroller (ESP32 or something similar), and I want to combine:

* data from the VCU (RPM, current, motor temp, battery voltage)
* data from my own sensors (GPS, IMU, temperature, etc.)

The problem is:  
I’m not sure if I can actually **pull live data directly from the VCU** in a way I can use, or if I need to measure things myself using separate sensors.

I’m still very new to this stuff, and I don’t completely understand things like quadrature encoders, buffers, CAN bus, signal tapping, etc. I don’t want to break anything on the car or interfere with the VCU signals.

# Here’s what I’m trying to figure out:

1. **Can I safely read live data from the Alltrax AC1?**
   * Is there a way to talk to it directly (USB, CAN, UART)?
   * Are there any open protocols or does everything go through their Toolkit software only?
2. **If I can’t read data from the VCU**, what’s the best way to measure the same data myself?
   * Like reading motor RPM from the encoder
   * Battery voltage/current
   * Temperatures
   * Without messing up the controller signals
3. **What’s the best beginner-friendly way to learn this stuff?**
   * Reading encoders
   * Using buffers/line drivers
   * Combining sensor data
   * Designing a simple in-car dashboard

Any tutorials, YouTube videos, diagrams, or project examples would help me a ton.  
I’m trying to learn all this from scratch and the amount of information is starting to overwhelm me a bit.

1ox9kpe,"First time installing wheels/spacers, took it for a drive and there is this crunchy creaking noise...","Hey, will try to keep brief,   
I just bought my first car (2010 Vibe/Matrix) been doing a lot of work myself on it, bought some wheels to replace the steelies it came with and thought I could swap them out myself. 

A lot went wrong, ended up needing spacers, then ended up striping and breaking one of the wheel lug bolts, did the work myself to install a new tapered bolt, had to take the breaks off, then realized I needed a caliper compression tool to get them back on.  (all the issues are on the same front-left wheel) 

Got everything installed and took it for a test drive and now it has this sound, I don't really feel it in the steering wheel, the bolts are on tight, I think it may be from the metal plate behind the breaks, everything is super rusty (I live in Ontario), but trying to bend it out has not helped, seems worse when turning but as far as I can tell nothing is rubbing 

The noise is freaking me out, I drove for 15 mins and it only seemed to get worse.  it could be that dust plate, or maybe I damage the brake rotor as it was ceased to the hub as it took force to remove.

1ox9i1k,Slow tire leak goes fast once driving above ~60mph.,"Hey all,

I have a slow leak in one tire. I recently put on my winter tires (new) and the pressure still drops, so I'm fairly certain it is the wheel/valve stem/tmps sensor versus the actual rubber tire. 

It will drop like 1-2psi overnight but when I start driving over 60mph it will drop much faster, like 10psi within an hour. I have a big road trip coming up so I'm hoping to get it sorted before I have to drive a lot and risk damaging the new winter tire and wheel and making the trip take longer.

Based off this, any initial idea if it's the valve stem, wheel, or tmps sensor? I'm fairly certain the valve stem is new with the winter tire, it has a different cap compared to the old one from my all seasons.

Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions!

On my lexus, it is often done the same way but I was able to detach a few small bolts that held my lower ball joint to the knuckle and I was able to move the knuckle out enough that way to get axle out of it, this saved me from having to get an alignment after as I did not touch any alignment components saving another $100.  You can get the axle for about $80 off amazon, free shipping if you happen to have amazon prime.  Alignment will be somewhere around $110 maybe. Breaker bar to get axle nut off and torque wrench to get new one on can both be rented from your autoparts store, they charge your credit card the full price of the tools when you check them out then refund your card when you bring them back.   Hopefully you have some basic tools that you might need like sockets/wrenches that will fit the other bolts and nuts, you will need a socket that will fit the axle nut, you may have to buy that off amazon yourself, $10 or so.   Here is one video but I would watch several different videos doing the same job on the same vehicle as you may pick up tips here and there or maybe even a way to get the axle out without having to remove those strut bolts.  I notice this guy did not mention bending the indent out of the axle nut before taking it off, probably because he had an inpact gun, you see him bending it in at the end of the video on the new nut, you need to use a punch or screwdriver and hammer to bend that back out so it is easier to take off, I am sure other videos will show that.   If you decide to take it on yourself you can get it done and serviced (alignment) for a total of about $300, or  $200 if you are able to find a way to get the axle out and new one in without having to touch those 2 alignment bolts on the strut.

Belt i replaced is a strechfit  belt that only runs the waterpump off a cam pully not the serpentine belt.

Alright so here is my odysey.

My Heater is not putting out hot air at all after replacing some parts. It was workung fine before my waterpump went out.

I have replaced

-Water Pump Belt(broke due to.waterpump seizing up)

-Water Pump(factory waterpump on a 200+k mile engine. Just old and seized up)

-Thermostat (was old )

-upper radiator hose(belt wrapped around it when it broke and pulled it into the pully)

-coolant temp sensor ( broke it by accadent)

-Radiator (Found a crack in one of the ports that the radiator goes on. It was the factory rafiator so I just replaced it)

I have tried these things to troubbleshoot this.

-Bleed the air out of the coolant (run the car with coolant cap off till it stops bubbling and going down)

-reset the computer after installing the sensor by dissconnecting the battery for a few min .

-checked that water was flowing into the heater by squeesing the hoses(intake was firm return hose was soft while the engine was running at temp and heater was on)

-Just looked around the engine for anything i can find that might bedisconnected.

-blower moter is activating

-fairly sure the flap thing that switches over cold to hot air is working because I can feel the diffrence in the air comming out of the vents when i turn it to heat.

What else should I do/check to diagnose this?

Of course​, they went over the vehicle with dollar signs in their eyes.  I am not a mechanic.  But I know how to figure stuff out.  Already had looked at replacing the thermostat.  New thermostat, some towels, coolant, and a few hand tools.  Easy enough.  YouTube was a big help.  AT the time I saw the estimate, I just know there's no possible way this is an $850 repair!  Who is estimating these labor ​times?  Because parts surely aren't that expensive!

Fast forward.. I did the repair myself.  In the garage.  In maybe an hour.  For $50 all in.  ​Including some new coolant. Reused some of the old but not much.  ​So that another $190 I didn't spend for the coolant service.

You need to remove the intake manifold to get the plugs out. The intake pipe/box that attached to the throttle body takes some finagling. Put some grease on the rubber grommets when reinstalling.

10mm and 13mm ratcheting wrenches are what I use to get the support brackets off the manifold. I just get the brackets unbolted far enough to clear the mounting studs, don't remove them. The harness will move out of the way far enough.

Torquing the intake manifold correctly is critical since you are using steel bolts threaded into plastic. 

If you are feeling froggy, the Dorman aluminum oil cooler/filter housing is an upgrade, and you are over halfway there. The intake gasket set you got for the plugs should include lower plenum gaskets, too. You will need Torx bits/sockets to replace that.

I started noticing the engine was slightly rough during idle seemingly randomly and not consistent. 

It seemed to stay like this for a few weeks and then this morning when I went to start the car, it was turning over and as soon as I let go of the ignition key, the engine died. On my reattempt to start the truck I held the key for longer and it worked.

Yes. And the downside of this is every time you turn the ignition on it has to boot from cold so that takes 30 seconds or so typically before it's usable. Xtron seem to be the only brand that doesn't do this, using hibernate mode instead. But the downside of that is when you've installed something you then have to find you need to reboot it to get the icons to show.

Then just get a decent mainstream brand one that supports Apple Car Play or Android Auto so it effectively acts like a touch screen for your phone."

1ox870w,Corolla wipers streaking / smearing issue & fix,"The other day I made a post mostly just to rant that my 1 year old car with under 16k on the clock was on its 4th set of wipers. 

This post is to confirm the issue and the fix. 

Link to original post - https://www.reddit.com/r/CarTalkUK/s/LHkDqjG32b

The issue is the original Toyota / Denso wipers.

So the factory fit set of wipers started to streak on the drivers side on the downward stroke when the car was around 7 months old. Right in my field of vision. Almost as if there were leaves stuck under the blade. No amount of cleaning the screen or blades would fix it. 

I replaced them with the Optifit wipers Toyota offer (£40) as the factory fit Denso ones were £80 from Toyota. 

The Optifit wipers wiped 90% of the screen fine but didn’t contact the screen properly at the ends of the blades so missed areas and were generally very poor build quality. Hence they were replaced. 

I then bought a set of Denso wipers (same as factory fit) and after 6 months / 7k miles the drivers side started to streak badly on the downward stroke again. Exactly the same as the first set. 

On my last post someone posted a link to a Toyota forum where many other people were reporting the same issue with the original / Denso wipers. Some reporting streaking after only 1500 miles. This lead to me googling the issue and it’s actually quite common and known to Toyota. They even have a service bulletin for it where they basically just replace the wiper blade (and then tell you to sod off when it starts to streak again). 

Many reports of this issue from Yaris and Corolla owners. No idea if the Denso / Toyota wipers are very poor quality or if they just don’t like the car. But the owners forums are full of people saying moving to a different brand (Bosch) resolves the issue. 

On my last post I had people telling me my windscreen needed cleaning, that it was my detailing products at fault, I was cleaning the wiper blades wrong, using my wipers too much, someone even suggested it was an issue with my eyesight 🙄 
I thought I’d been quite clear in that post that the issue was with the car / wipers and nothing to do with me, my detailing products or the way I was using the wipers, but it seems there is no convincing some people. You’d think I was some eejit who was smearing peanut butter on my windscreen. 
I think this is my 17th car and I’ve never had an issue with wipers previously. Oh and a lot of people seem to think glass sealant / rain repellent is the work of the devil. 

Anyway. I’ve driven a couple of hours in the rain since fitting the Bosch aero wipers and they are superb. Zero ghosting which the Denso wipers always did since new and today I’ve detailed the car and applied a nice coat of glass sealant - some of you will no doubt be clutching your pearls at the thought of this.  
Bosch wipers work perfect with the rain repellent (I’ve driven in the rain since). I’d had to strip the last coat off the windscreen as the Toyota wipers didn’t like it and juddered like crazy so it’s nice to be able to have it back on the screen as it is something I personally like. 

TLDR : if your original Toyota wipers are leaving streaks on the windscreen don’t buy replacement Toyota / Denso wipers as they’re sh*t.

UV is the source of a lot of the damage done to tyres that makes them perish, winter tyres will already recieve less UV exposure because they are on the car for only a small number of months but also a time of year when UV levels are lower.

You can inspect the tyres for signs of perishing , usually cracks in the rubber on the sidewall and in the actual tread tracks themselves. Once you see that then theyr'e perished and need replacing.

I'm planning to sell my 15yo car. It's my first car and so it will be my first sale (hopefully). Just passed MOT for another year and works just fine apart from a couple of little things like:  
\- AUX cable needs to be in just at the right angle to work correctly or you only get one channel. Radio, Bluetooth, CD player, speakers - all works just fine otherwise.  
\- Driver's side heated seat not working, passenger side does.

My initial idea was to be upfront about all the little things when advertising it, but my dad says there is no reason to and no one is expecting a 15yo car to be fully working when it comes to little QoL things like that, as long as the main parts are fine. Also mentioned he never even used AUX cable or heated seats himself.

His advice is: when asked about them directly - be honest, but otherwise don't sell yourself short by needlesly mentioning what is not working and giving the other party bargaing power. Especially since we're selling it for under a thousand anyway.

I worked as a vehicle technician for about 4.5 years in dealerships. Started at 16, fully trained Level 3, and F-gas certified. I left the trade just before turning 21. My dealership experience was pretty frustrating if I'm honest.

At my first dealership, they wouldn't train me properly at all - they kept me on tyres, spinning filters, and quick maintenance jobs because it helped them smash their quarterly bonus targets. Meanwhile, I wasn't getting the technical exposure I was promised.

| left for another dealer for better development, but ended up stitched up in a different way - constantly doing warranty interior rattles/ knock jobs. Anyone who's done those knows they can swallow your entire day and don't build your skills much either.

Eventually I left the trade and moved into a railway apprenticeship doing substation works which I've now completed and 1 year out my time. I work 36 hours a week with good stability, but I've realised I'm basically wasting my mechanical qualifications and a skillset I put years into. And honestly, I do miss some of the job ( I know it's sounds crazy but most of us got in the trade cause we had an interest in cars until the weight of the motor trade crushed us)

Right now I'm stuck between two options:
1. ﻿﻿﻿Work 1-2 days a week at a small independent garage. Negotiate an hourly rate, do real mechanical work again, and see if I still enjoy it outside the dealership pressure.
2. ﻿﻿﻿Start a small mobile side gig Servicing, brakes, small diagnostics, MOT prep. But I'm aware of the insurance, van, tools,manufactures blocking aftermarket scanners software and general hassle.

* ﻿﻿moved from dealership to independent
* ﻿﻿started mobile side work

* ﻿﻿OR work automotive still

Ive recently bought a car and have added my dad as a named driver, with myself as the main driver/owner. I live separately from my parents and so have used my address, but provided license for both of us when we set up the insurance and the V5C is also with my address.

What im asking is, hastings has asked me to send in proof of my cover details (license, v5c etc), but am realising that my dad's license shows a different address. Does anyone have any experience on whether this will affect/invalidate the policy? I was under the impression named drivers didnt need to reside at the same address, and I dont remember being asked when I set it up.

From Research I've Found out that people not even just in Latvia but other Europe countries Drive UK Registered cars without MOT and Tax Paid - as Police of those countries wouldnt check if the UK Registered Car has UK MOT and Tax, And only Check Insurance - If the car has Insurance the police doesnt do anything, and this BMW Winterbeater and the Neighbor with a 2012 Tiguan probably do just that,

Check the battery voltage with engine off and on. Check against what it should be (around 12v off, around 14v when on) if it is 18+ that’s an alternator issue, but I assume other things may have got you there by now. 


Generally though you need to get the car warm and take it for long runs every so often. If that car has some sort of diesel filter, that will get clogged. Also with short trips oil changes should be done on time not mileage necessarily as soot and other stuff can build up in the oil from things like high choke on startup, inefficiency of the engine when cold etc

I topped up light went off but contacted the seller and had it taken in to their service center. I was told not to worry as it was in warranty (3 month).
They couldn't find anything immediately causing the issue but said they would do an oil consumption test for 500 miles.
So I get my car and use as normal coming up to 500 miles and light is on again. Contact the service center take it back in. They cannot find an obvious issue so it must be internal the service manager says. Says he has to contact the warranty firm about next steps. I think all is fine and it'll get sorted other than oil issue car is great.

The warranty company calls me says they are declining the claim as they don't cover excessive oil consumption. The garage contact me saying they are challenging the decision as it's an engine issue that may need a reconditioned engine but that will put me above the £1000 claim limit and I'll have to pay the shortfall.

Anyway, I’ve always liked the bmw tourers, and more recently looking into it the 2019 or newer 5 series it seems quite good. Does anyone have any experience with either the 3 or 5 series tourers, I was looking at the petrol because of fuel cost but economy wise the diesel may also be better, but after thoughts, I drive into Bristol which has a clean air zone so it has to be ok to use that without charge.

* The obvious one: How much more painful will running this be on my wallet than my outgoing barge: an E39 530d auto? It does about 40mpg on a run and about 25 in town. Wishful thinking is leading me to believe that the cheaper cost of petrol and the shorter warm up time of the petrol V8 will mean semi-acceptable fuel consumption in comparison given my short commute.
* Aluminium unibodies and rust. Is structural corrosion a concern with these alu-body XJs? Some of the ones I've seen have started to bubble at the door bottoms, arches etc. Some people say they can suffer from underbody corrosion that can be extremely expensive to fix and others claim that they'll never progress past surface bubbling due to alu patina characteristics. Where does the truth lie here?
* Timing chains. I'm reasonably competent and have a 4-post ramp, engine hoist etc. Is this something I could do myself or is a Jag specialist the better idea? Assuming tensioners on anything I'm likely to find at the cheap end of the market will need done.
* How is the torque and power from the N/A 4.2, as compared to my outgoing M57? I'm assuming the wider torque band will yield a much stronger feeling engine overall.

The bubbling you see on panels is from contamination in the paint process. It’s very common to see even on high end stuff like Ferraris and Astons. Aluminium is more likely to fail through fatigue and keep away from gallium (not that this happens in the real world much).

I recently bought a used 2019 Volvo T4 (petrol), 45k miles, from Volvo Waylands for £15,800.

Even after a long drive, when I stop at a red light, I can still see the smoke in my rearview mirror. It’s not constant, but it keeps coming and going.

I’m not sure if this is normal for this engine or the weather, or if it’s a sign of a bigger issue. Since the car is quite new and low-mileage, I wasn’t expecting to see any noticeable exhaust smoke at all. 

For those who watched the video:
Am I overreacting? Is this normal condensation or something I should be worried about, not a heavy smell but everytime I drive it's happening for the last two weeks?

And more importantly, should I consider returning the car to the dealer while I still can?
