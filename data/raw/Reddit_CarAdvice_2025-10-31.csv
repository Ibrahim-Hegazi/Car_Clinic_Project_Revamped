I waited over an hour for the car to be fully asleep and made sure all doors/trunk were closed and nothing was plugged in. When I connected the multimeter leads to the negative battery terminal and the negative battery cable, I got some sparking and my headlights flicked on and then off. The reading on the multimeter jumped to around 7-8 and then fell to 2.7 where it stayed - a far cry from the <0.5 I'd hoped to see.

When I've seen videos of people doing this test, they did not have such a large amp jump and it doesn't seem like the test should cause the headlights to flicker on. I made sure the headlight switch in the car was in the off position and not just the automatic position. Is the fact that connecting the multimeter caused the headlights to flicker on indicitive of an issue? Perhaps that ""woke"" the car up and that's why the amp reading was settling at 2.7?

 if you get any reading other than 0.000.. you have parasitic draw on that fuse..  you will find several fuses that have some parasitic draw. note the locations of each fuse.  check the owners manual to see what the fuses operate.. you will have to get access to the factory service repair into and the power distribution diagrams to see what the fuses control.."

1okf4w0,2011 Lincoln MKZ 6 cylinder was sitting in my driveway for 2 years,"Please excuse my car illiteracy. The car has close to 128,000 miles on it.

I just got this car back on the road. It needed a new battery, and it started right up and was driving fine.

I needed to get the car registered and inspected, which required some routine maintenance such as brakes, oil change, etc. We put 80ish miles on the car to clear the monitors to get it to pass inspection, which it did. The gears were changing as smooth as can be. 

The one repair it needed besides the brakes was a new hose for the transmission fluid, which I had done today after the inspection was already passed. 

The mechanic said the transmission fluid was dark and burnt smelling, when he replaced the hose. The car rode fine on the way home, but when I went to use it again shortly after parking it, the gears were slipping and banging like crazy. 

I’ve scheduled a transmission fluid/filter change for Saturday, NOT a flush, but I’m curious how likely it is to resolve the issue. 

Is it likely the transmission is toast, even though it never had even the faintest issues prior? Is it more likely that the transmission just needs to be bled, fluid changed, filter changed, etc, and it will be fine?

If a hose was replaced and the level not filled correctly then its possible that the filter is picking up air which is compressible so your line pressure will decrease which can cause slipping or just clutch pack failure

Nothing different.

What I will say is that one of my wheels IS a few thousand miles newer (Costco warranty), and I am assuming that’s the cause of the pull. I’ll switch them around to see if that’s the case.

However, more worried about my “worn shocks” issue, I don’t know if it’s a bent strut or actual worn shocks. I most likely will have to take it to a mechanic and see.

Damage and holes in interior seats.

 with the black plastic coil removed...  you can rotate the knob that was under it while spraying brake or carb cleaner thru the shutter valve shown in photo 4. until its clean..

 use new gaskets and reinstall on the throttle body then use a new mounting gasket and install the throttle body.. 

 carbon build up gets into the idle air control valve shutter and prevents it from being rotated easily by the computer varying the voltage to the black plastic thing.. which is a coil of wire.

 you should also clean the throttle body bore.. but spray cleaner on the towel not into the bore and wipe the carbon out.. spraying solvent into the bore will get in and destroy the throttle position sensor.. 

 since you are in there testing..  buy one of these gauges. less than 20 bucks at most parts stores..      buy 4 feet of 5/32 vacuum hose too.  and a vacuum Tee assortment.. 5 bucks.  tee it into the vacuum hose going to the EGR valve top.. put the gauge on the windshield and drive around the block.  you should NOT see vacuum while stopped.. but you should see progressive vacuum as you accelerate at a moderate speed from a stop.. maxing out around 45MPH..  this checks the EGR vacuum modulator..  brown/black plastic thing nearby.."

If your car stopped, and you were able to get it going with a jump start, that means your battery was dead..


The reason for your battery going dead, is likely your alternator.  


To confirm this, just jumpstart the car with a booster pack or a boost, and when it is running, measure the voltage at the battery.  This will then confirm that your alternator is working or not working."

* An elderly friend of mine bought a \[supposedly\] new MY22 Kia Rio from a dealership in 2021. She barely drives it.
* This year she's had to change a wheel twice due to bad bearings.
* A couple of days ago her car was misfiring. The dealership says 2 fuel injectors failed and they are waiting for replacements.
* She recalls having to wait for delivery when she purchased it because the dealership was exchanging the front rugs. She doesn't remember what they looked like before the exchange.
* She told me that, for the first few months she had the car, she got a few (around 3 before she contacted the dealership) letters from the dealership advising her to bring the car in for maintenance. She kept those letters (is looking for them now) because, although they had the correct VIN, the listed mileages were over 10k. Her car is still under 5K.
* Her suspicion (for various reasons) is that the car was a demo or loaner model.

A mechanic shop could fix the engine mount issue for around $650-$700 and the hot air for around $250 or so if that's the issue. The price depends heavily on which actuator is faulty and how difficult it is to access

1ok2v2y,"2007 Hyundai Sonata SE V6 - Failed starter was replaced with a remanufactured starter, and now the plug from the ignition into the starter has melted","I have a 2007 Hyundai Sonata SE V6 and the starter went bad so two and a half weeks ago I had it replaced at a mechanic with a remanufactured one they purchased and installed. I replaced the battery before that with a new one because the starter sounded slow and labored when turning the ignition, and then the battery tested bad, so I assumed that was the lone issue - but it turned out to be the starter and everything was fine since it was replaced.

Fast forward to a couple days ago, I was at the store and noticed the ignition wasn't starting, no clicking, no attempted start, nothing. And then a moment later, I try again and it starts. Get back home and attempt again - nothing. A few tries later it starts like nothing happened. So I take it to the mechanic and they look from under the car and comment the starter is extremely hot and that the plug from the ignition into the starter is now melted. I asked if it was like that when I had the starter replaced before, and they said no and the plug was in perfect condition. I'm assuming the intermittent start was obviously due to the melted connection. They're looking at it now, but I'm trying to understand what's going on myself so I avoid any unnecessary costs.

I'm a computer guy, not a car guy, so don't know a lot - I've researched a couple days and the common answers I've seen are:

\- Bad remanufactured starter (solenoid?) that may be pulling too much current

\- Bad or loose connection into the starter from the ignition that caused increased resistance which heated up the connector and caused it to melt

\- Battery not properly grounded to the frame of the car, so ground is some other area that would cause the wire to become extremely hot

I just want to get the jist of what's reasonable here and what a good mechanic would logically limit it down to and do. I'm assuming test the remanufactured starter somehow, and utilize a multimeter to tested grounding of the battery as well as how much current is flowing from the ignition to the starter? It was mentioned to me at the time of taking it in it could be something with the ignition, but that seems odd as I understand it, it only provides the initial current to the starter solenoid to kickstart the engine, and the connector hadn't melted previously when I took it in the first time.

Most will tell you that the head gasket is fried and you're in for a big bill. But before we jump to that conclusion, let me ask. Did the car overheat recently? If yes, did you drive it after overheating or did you just shut off the engine? 

Now, let's continue. Have you recently topped up your coolant? Any visible leaks?   
You could always start by changing the coolant reservoir cap. It can surely get worn in time and it will lose pressure. The cooling system, once it leaks pressure, it will cause the coolant to boil like that. Inspect that first, always begin with the cheapest possible fix.

Moving on, it could be the thermostat, but at this point you will notice the dashboard saying your engine overheated. It could also be the water pump(or the gasket around it, if it has one). A leaky water pump can actually cause the coolant to boil like that! If the leak is severe, it actually allows air to flow through the leak, hence leading to this issue. 

Radiator could also be hit, but until we get to this point, do the following:

\-replace coolant reservoir cap, no reason to replace expensive parts before checking this one(but be careful, coolant reservoir cap, NOT RADIATOR CAP, do NOT mess with the radiator cap especially when the engine is hot!)  
\-thermostat and water pump could be culprits too, check if you see any leaks around the water pump/thermostat

And a few more tips for you:  
\- if you take it to a shop and they do a pressure test and the pressure is being lost, there you go. But, if the pressure is not dropping during a test, that does NOT conclude anything! It could be leaking coolant ONLY during the engine operating! I have seen this before, always check please!  
\- if you do NOT see any leaks, do not give up and conclude that it's not leaking anywhere, it could be such a small leak or it could leak on a hot surface and that would make the coolant evaporate.  
\-when I say leak, check only around thermostat and water pump...the leaking coolant reservoir does NOT count because that's only the effect, not the cause! Simply start by replacing the coolant reservoir cap and you rule it out.

Hope you get it sorted.

1ojwoa1,Toyota Corolla Electrical Issue,"Persistent electrical issues on 2006 Toyota Corolla 1.4 L petrol — need advice from anyone who’s seen similar

Hey everyone,

I’ve been chasing a series of weird electrical issues on my 2006 Toyota Corolla 1.4 L petrol. Three mechanics have looked at it with no solution — alternator, battery, IACV, MAF, and vacuum leaks all checked and cleared — so I’m planning to bring it to an auto-electrical specialist next.

Here’s a rundown of the symptoms, roughly in order they appeared:

First 3 fan blower settings stopped working (only 4th speed works)

Low charge from the cigarette lighter socket

When using the 4th fan speed, headlights dip slightly

Idle issues: used to stick at ~700 rpm, now pulses continuously between 1200 → 1400 rpm

Heater has stopped working completely

Radio LCD intermittently glitches or scrambles


Everything points toward a grounding or wiring issue, but I’d love to hear from anyone who’s had similar electrical gremlins with this generation of Corolla (or similar Toyotas) — what turned out to be the cause or fix in your case?

Thanks in advance for any insight",1,1761822282.0,3,MechanicAdvice,1761939300,2025-10-30 11:04:42,2025-10-31 19:35:00,"RudbeckiaIS (Score: 3): Stupid question. Have you blown or melted any fuse yet? This is a serious parasitic drain while in operation and I am surprised nothing blew yet.

1ojw3c3,"My little car is losing power, and my mechanics haven't been able to figure out why. Advice?","Hi all, I've brought my car to two local mechanics and neither have been able to help; hoping someone here can.

My car is a 2017 Nissan Micra, 1.6L 4cylinder 5-speed manual.

For the last 8 months or so, the following cycle has been happening:

When my gas hits 3/4 full, I get a warning that my fuel cap is loose. (I've replaced the cap; it didn't help.)

The next time I drive the car, that warning goes away and gets replaced by a check engine light.

The check engine light stays on until I fill up with gas. Then it goes away.

I drive until the tank hits 3/4 full, and the cycle begins again.

I've found that if I top up the tank while the fuel cap warning is on, the check engine light doesn't comes on.


I've been ok simply topping up the tank like that, but now (for the past 3 weeks or so), the car has suddenly been getting sluggish, especially up hills. No matter how hard I push the gas pedal, it can barely hold its speed (and sometimes slows down) going up hills. The fuel economy has started to drastically decline, and I'm having to constantly top up the oil. (Though see no evidence of oil under the car when it's parked.)

Any ideas or advice on what I can check?

RudbeckiaIS (Score: 1): 100% EVAP system.

Start by checking the two EVAP lines running underneath the car and going from fuel tank to the EVAP canister in the engine bay. If they are sound, the problem is the EVAP canister itself: differently from other manufacturers like Toyota it's a non-serviceable unit, meaning any problems needs replacement of the full EVAP canister. The good news is it's a relatively cheap part even when bought from a dealership, much cheaper than Honda, Toyota etc. parts. 

This should take care of gas cap warning, loss of power and increased fuel consumption. 

The oil consumption is an unrelated issue. The Asia specs engines, especially those for the Chinese market, have always had problems with the crankcase ventilation valves (PCV) at very low km already and the typical piston ring issues of Japanese engines at high km. Otherwise it's a pretty reliable unpretentious engine. 

To sum it all up: EVAP line check first, if they are fine replace the EVAP canister assembly, then replace the PCV."

Get a second opinion. But don't say anything about any problems. Take it to an independent shop to change the oil. Most will give it a once over to see if there's any other work they can get you to have done there. If it's not their policy to do that on a simple oil change, call ahead and ask if they do, then tell them that there no apparent problems but while you are there, you would like to have them do a safety inspection to see if there's anything that may need to be done in the future like the brakes for example.

If it turns out that it really does need the bushings and/or ball joints replaced, tell them to show you what's bad. An honest shop will have no problem with this request. It's a good idea to do both sides because the other side can't be much better. It will also mean you will have to pay for one wheel alignment instead of two when you do the other side."

They said to me pay 300 cash for them to replace it or bring a battery to them (I live over an hour away from this repair) because without this battery they basically said they won’t/can’t give my car back. I obviously am a bit worried as they’ve also asked for cash and also had a review of a situation to mine where they’ve asked for 300 cash for a battery and didn’t give that customer a receipt.
I just found this very strange and suspicious as it’s been in their hands for weeks on end and battery don’t just die randomly (sometimes but idk)! My car is regularly checked by my dad who’s VERY well versed in cars and I’ve had no issues previously with my car or its battery.

It's possible that you could do that, but many warranties will not cover wear and tear items nor pre-emptive replacement without a failure. So you might get one or two things covered, but you might not get anything at all covered.

0330_bupahs (Score: 1): The garage isnt going to simply replace whatever they feel is faulty, they will have to fill out a warranty request with your warranty company then they have to approve the repairs. It's usually fairly involved with explanations of the fault, pictures, etc etc and can take hours or even days depending on the warranty company's processing time.  What you need to do is find out exactly how warranty claims are handled:

1. Can you go to any garage or just ones approved by the warranty company.
2. What's the payment look like. Do you have to pay the shop then the warranty company reimburses you or do they pay directly to the shop. 
3. Is there a ""copay"" meaning do you pay part of the repair or do they (company) pay for it all 
4. What exactly is covered, just because it says ""everything electrical or mechanical"" does not mean literally everything, there are always exceptions.

Third party warranties are great to have, but you really need to know all the ins and outs or you end up getting stuck with a 1000 (or more) repair that you thought was covered."

* Engine air filter w/ new intake boot, $215.03

[https://www.reddit.com/r/autorepair/comments/1k577r5/safelite\_did\_this\_to\_my\_truck\_aio/](https://www.reddit.com/r/autorepair/comments/1k577r5/safelite_did_this_to_my_truck_aio/)

Here's what's happened since...

April 22- I took the truck back to safelite. They apologized for the mistakes and removed and reset the rear glass and replaced the fasteners and bolted in the seatbelts. 

  
September 17- My daughter noticed water dripping from the top of the window again. I called Safelite to let them know the issue remains. I asked if I could take it to another Safelite location, because I was losing confidence in the original location. They schedule a next day appointment.

September 18 - I drive 35 miles and arrive at the time of my appointment. We have 3 locations near us, but they are all about the same distance away. The person at the front desk says that they don't have a replacement unit in the store, and they won't risk taking mine out without a replacement ""just in case"". They schedule me for the next day.

September 19 - I arrive at 10am. I sat in the waiting room until 3pm. The tech comes and tells me that they got the glass replaced, but the power slider isn't working in the new unit. He said they would order the ""part"" and contact me in a couple days to schedule install. Not sure if they meant a motor or an entire new glass. 

Over the next couple weeks, I tried calling a few times. I couldn't find the local number and all the numbers I tried went to their automated nation-wide call center. 

Today October 30. It's been over a month with no word on the power slider. It rained yesterday and my truck stunk again this morning. I felt around under the seat and it's leaking again, worse than ever. The bottom edge of the seatback, which sets against the back wall is SOAKING wet. Scheduled again for Monday at 8am....

I've missed 3 days of work for this, not counting the original replacement. Fortunately, I'm self employed. On top of that, each time they reinstall the window, they get more sealant/adhesive on the painted surfaces. If the truck was white, it would look awful. There are also some minor dents around the opening, i assume from prying. I'm at a loss with this situation.

1okb0kv,Would you limp this 16 miles to the mechanic or pay $150 to have it towed?,"I have a 2007 Mazda Tribute, 190k miles. Yesterday afternoon I used engine degreaser to clean gunky film off the top of the engine that I thought was giving off a noxious burning oil odor. After consulting some online sources about how to carefully use water to rinse this area afterwards while avoiding electrical components, I did so. 

When I started the car hours later, it started rough and sputtered/ran rough at idle and low speeds. It ran fine above about 10 mph. The check engine light flashed a couple times but did not stay on. 

I drove it 13 miles to work and checked the oil shortly afterwards, only to find it way beyond the max level. I checked the oil just yesterday and it was exactly at max level (got an oil change two weeks ago). I'm not certain what this extra fluid is; it could be water from rinsing, but I have no idea how so much could've gotten inside. My brother theorized that perhaps I got the spark plugs wet (which could explain the rough running) and maybe the misfiring plugs pushed gasoline into the engine through an undiagnosed, failing head gasket.

At any rate, it's still at my work, and I'm going to get it to my mechanic tomorrow. The only question is whether to risk driving it the 16 miles or have it towed for about $150. The mechanic says to tow it to be on the safe side, but I've already driven it for 13 miles and it didn't explode. I'd like to save the money, but I'm weighing that against the possibility of doing real damage to the engine when I don't know exactly what the problem is.

1ok9xsj,2004 RAV4 Automatic AWD deceleration vibration,"Trying to diagnose this and getting mixed info from different shops. Here are some specifics: 

in drive, letting your foot off the gas to let it coast in what I suspect is 3rd gear, around 1600RPM 35mph, the engine or some part of the drivetrain starts to vibrate pretty bad, this is without pressing gas or brakes. It also feels that when this happens, the vehicle will decelerate faster in this range, almost like its being choked, but it hasn't thrown any trouble lights and the air filter is clean. 

I shifted into low gear 2 and the same exact thing happened now around 20mph, still at 1600RPM, so this problem is tied to engine speed. I figured this probably rules out anything with the wheels or brakes or suspension as well. being tied to RPM would suggest its a resonance thing, so maybe engine mounts?

well I checked the motor mounts, I was able to spot 4, one in front, rear, left and right. my mom said some shop said she was (missing one???) I can't imagine the engine has more than 4, and from what I could see none of them appeared torn.

Another shop told her it was the transmission but it seems dubious, idk why that would be tied to an engine RPM in between gear transitions. The shifting behavior of this rav4 has always been sorta...snappy and buckey, but every rav4 i've drove seems to be like that. 

This is an AWD as well, and I wonder if this behavior could be something with the differential? I replaced the diff fluid several years ago. 

Is it possible that the rubber in the engine mount bushings could just be worn out and less firm but not all the way torn? I am kinda confused how the vibration could cause the vehicle to decelerate more quickly during that resonance, but maybe i'm just unfamiliar with the car and its always had a snappy deceleration...

Is it possible to temporarily deactivate the AWD to see if the problem persists?

Now that it's at normal levels I'm noticing that sometimes when I accelerate It seems like the first gear lags in actually connecting. There is no jerk, And most recently when I was trying to accelerate. It almost didn't want to catch on at all until I reached the second gear.

1ok2aab,"2004 Honda CRV - Codes P0325, P0134 - Troubleshooting","**Issue:**

2004 Honda CRV with 235,000km (150,000 miles)

Check engine light is on and OBD2 tool shows following codes:

P0134 - Oxygen Sensor Circuit No Activity Detected (Bank 1, Sensor 1)

P0325 - Knock Sensor 1 Circuit Malfunction

I want to fix my vehicle to permanently clear these codes.

**What I've tried:**

Step 1: I cleared both codes several times with OBD2 scan tool but they kept coming back. Vehicle drove fine without any noticeable issues such as limited power, engine noise, ignition issues, etc. 

Step 2: Online research suggested knock and O2 sensors going bad was common on this vehicle. Decided to replace both the knock sensor and upstream O2 sensor. I used DELPHI AS10263 knock sensor and DELPHI ES10937 O2 sensor respectively from RockAuto. 

Step 3: Drove the vehicle and check engine light comes back on still showing both error codes. Tried clearing codes and trying again but codes keep coming back. With the new sensors, car will have a fluctuating idle and ""jerk"" when accelerating as if the fuel/air is being cut off at intervals. The issues go away once the vehicle has been driven for around 5 minutes (gets up to temperature). I changed the O2 sensor back to the old one and the fluctuating idle and jerking issue goes away but the engine lights come back on same as Step 1. 

**Next Steps?:**

I'm wondering if you guys can help me diagnose this issue. I don't have a sophisticated OBD2 tool so would need one to see what is going on with the ECU. But, I wouldn't know what to be looking for... 

Maybe I have a bad heater circuit for the O2 sensor?  Maybe I got a dud O2 sensor from RockAuto or it has different parameters that my ECU cannot map correctly? Maybe cleaning my MAF sensor and/or PCV valve? Bad injectors or spark plugs?

Any suggestions would be super helpful. For now, I'm going to drive the vehicle with the old O2 sensor and try to figure out next steps. 

Thank you so much for reading this!

To properly check oil level, follow these steps. 

1. Run engine until operating temp (drive it for 5-10 min, until temp gauge gets to the middle on most cars)

2. Turn car off, let it sit for approx 10 min so oil can settle and drain back to pan. 

3. Pull dipstick out, wipe it clean, reinsert, hold it there for a few sec, pull ‘er back out and read level. 

 Never go off the first reading, always check after car sat for about 10 min, and never check it cold. 

Doesn’t hurt to check it multiple times, a 3rd or 4th reading doesn’t hurt and takes less than 30 seconds.

Well I told them I couldn’t make it out until a few days later, in which they replied “just let me know, I can take it to express and they will diagnose it for free”. That got me thinking. I’ve never heard of a mechanic whether it be a shop or mobile diagnose an issue for absolutely free unless they were just fixing maybe a mistake they made. Are there actual places out there that do that? Either way, I told them I can check it out but if express can do it for free why even ask me? Basically I think it’s a case of them not wanting to have to drive down there, but instead wanting me to waste my gas and time to come check it out for absolutely nothing.

1ok9skn,Help with 2007 VW Caddy,"I’ve got a 2007 1.9 Caddy. The power kept dropping off only at the higher speeds (50mph+). My foot is flat down and there’s no acceleration but the engine keeps running. After a little while it would suddenly kick back in and accelerate again. 
Various mechanics have looked at it. I’ve had new fuel filters, new fuel lines, injectors done , and a new turbo.
After getting it back from having that work done, I was driving it and there was a hideous noise and everything suddenly just stopped. It was catastrophic and required an engine replacement.
The engine is now replaced, but I am once again experiencing the exact same power loss issue.

1okdxqr,Alignment Done Didn’t Adjust Camber,"Hi Reddit, quick question on alignment. Just had one done after my car was pulling for a good couple of days.

Did the alignment, my guy said that my shocks are worn and that he’s unable to adjust the camber for my rear wheels and that my car is sagging. Car still pulls toward the LEFT (have to adjust wheel to the right to compensate) However, I do not notice any degradation in ride quality nor excessive bumping while going over speed bumps (live in an area with a speed bump every 50 feet or so) and I tried going over them fast as well as slow. Nothing different.

What I will say is that one of my wheels IS a few thousand miles newer (Costco warranty), and I am assuming that’s the cause of the pull. I’ll switch them around to see if that’s the case.

However, more worried about my “worn shocks” issue, I don’t know if it’s a bent strut or actual worn shocks. I most likely will have to take it to a mechanic and see.

After 2 weeks the airbag light came on. I scanned with Blue Driver and had the 41-11 fault only. I pulled the fender liners, checked the connection to the sensor, and then swapped the front impact sensors and the fault remained on the driver side indicating its not a bad sensor. 
A week later I pulled the (aftermarket) radio to install a USB cord. After reassembly (about 15 minutes total) the airbag light was off. I did not disconnect the battery so there was no hard reset. 
Light stayed off for 2 weeks then randomly popped on during a 3hr drive. I scanned and had all faults shown. Light stayed on for a week, was off for 3 weeks, and just came back earlier this week with the same faults.

What are the chances its the airbag module?
I considered taking it to Honda for a more thorough diagnosis but was quoted $400-$600 just for diag. I am mechanically inclined so doing the repair is no issue; but i dont want to pay Honda for diag, do the repair, and have it not fix the issue so im hoping someone has seen this issue before.

1okctul,Issue with front left tire after hitting curb for past months - first two shops found nothing wrong. What next?,"Hi all, thank you for your help in advance. 

About a month ago, I was driving 30 to 40 mph and hit a curb with my front left tire. Ever since then the car has been driving awkwardly. The car has been evaluated by two different tire shops who could not find anything wrong with it. The first tire shop aligned it and balanced it. Neither of them noticed any issues with the control arms or tie rods. They inspected the tire with no issue. The car feels uncontrolled when going over bounces and the front left tire feels skittery. Additionally, it feels like the tire is turning even though the steering wheel isn’t. There’s an airless nest to the front left tire and feels like it isn’t fully in contact with the ground like the other tires are. It seems to get worse over time after the alignment was done. Is this something that a typical auto shop should be able to diagnose and fix? From my research it seems like it could be a bend suspension component or a subframe shift. What tests need to be run to finally figure this out? Thank you!

However, when my wife picked up the car and drove away from the lot, she noticed a strange sound coming from her car so she took it back to the shop right away. The shop takes another quick look at it and tells her that she has a nail in her tire that they refused to fix. They said the nail must’ve already been in there when we brought the car to them, so they wouldn’t fix it. 

The thing that really bothers us about this is that when we look at the odometer on my wife’s car, it shows that the mechanics drove her car about 45 miles the day before we picked it up. I understand that mechanics have to drive a car after they fix it to make sure everything is working, but 45 miles seems very excessive.

1okb1tw,Replacing alternator on '73 Jeep CJ5,"Hey all,

I'm replacing the alternator in my '73 Jeep CJ5 and running into a fitment issue with the bottom mounting bracket. Attached images show the size comparison and the clearance issue at the bottom mount. Both alternators appear to be the same GM style, so I'm not sure how to handle.

What I have:

* **Original alternator:** Delco Remy #1103056 (63 amp)
* **New alternator:** Mr. Gasket 51203NG (140 amp, GM 10SI/12SI style)

The new alternator is physically longer front-to-back than the original (see image 1). The front mounting holes appear to line up fine, but the bottom rear mounting ear is too long and won't fit between the front bracket arm and the back ""L"" bracket that bolts to the engine block (see image 3).

Is there a spacer or adapter bracket that can make this work? Do I need to modify/bend the existing bracket? Should I return this alternator and get a different model? What's the proper name for that back ""L"" bracket piece if I need to source a different one?

Any help is appreciated - thanks!",16,1761856798.0,18,AskMechanics,1761939300,2025-10-30 20:39:58,2025-10-31 19:35:00,"turdburgled85 (Score: 9): The old alternator was cut to fit, its not original, just redrill the bracket holes or swap the cases.

1ok9usx,2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee with Negative Camber,"2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee (100k miles, 3.6L V6 4x4) has a negative camber issue on both front wheels, I got the car this way I dont know the history of it. From what I’ve read online it could be caused by bent suspension components. I looked at the suspension, and visually the parts like the strut, spindle, and upper and lower control arms all look straight but I could be wrong I dont have experience, this is first time I learned what camber is. There’s a lot of information out there, but some of it doesn’t seem will work in my situation.

I also learned that camber can be adjusted:

1. adjustable camber upper bolts on strut (this Jeep doesn’t appear to have that setup)
2. camber bracket plates ([https://www.spcalignment.com/product/82360](https://www.spcalignment.com/product/82360)), but according to the manufacturer, they don’t actually change the camber angle  they just make adjustment easier
3. adjustable front upper ball joint [https://www.moog-suspension-parts.com/moog-k100107](https://www.moog-suspension-parts.com/moog-k100107)

I read also read that worn lower ball joints or lower control arm bushings might contribute to the issue.

I’m also getting a traction control (stability control) light with a C0051-28 code, steering angle sensor is out of range. I cleared it with a scanner, but it returned after driving. The steering wheel is slightly off-center when driving straight, so I’m assuming the traction control light might go away once wheel alignment is done.

My question:

Will a proper wheel alignment fix the negative camber, or should I replace or adjust suspension components first before taking it in for alignment? I’d prefer not to replace parts unnecessarily if an alignment can correct it.  I also don’t want to take it for an alignment if this is cant be fixed by wheel alignment. Maybe someone here has experience with negative camber on a 2012 Jeep. Thank you for the help

There is no sound coming from the blower when this happened. 

But when I park and turn off the car and let it rest for about 1-2 hours, the AC start to work again.

**Additional Notes:**  
I have another car, a Toyota, and had similar issue, but the difference is, the blower was faulty, and the air did not blow at all, even if I let it rest or try it again on another day. After I changed the blower motor, it works perfectly.

In my E46 problem, the air from the AC comes back out after the car is rested for a while. And I think there is no issue of a weak blower motor since there is no strange sounds coming out of it, and the blower speed at the highest speed still works perfectly.

1ok7rdu,Could a donut spare tire cause brakes to falter?,"Got a flat so I was driving to a tire place this morning with a donut on. It was about 15 miles away and I stayed under 35mph the entire time. But 3/4 of the way there my brakes suddenly went out at an intersection. Thankfully I make a habit to brake well in advance just in case something like this ever happens, so I still had time to stop. Once the pedal got near the floor the brakes did kick in.  It was intermittent for the next 5 miles with the brakes feeling fine one minute and gone the next. I pulled over and saw the brake fluid was a little low. About 1/4-1/2 inch below the max line, so I topped it off (may have inadvertently added too much as the plastic was really dirty and it was unclear where the max line was).  After I got to the tire place it felt like the donut was locking up, car just not wanting to go and a weird sound coming from that area. I had also suspected it was intermittently locking up earlier because it left a drag mark in the drive way when I left this morning, but once I got on the road it was fine.  

The tire place went ahead and changed the tire and now the brakes feel great, even tighter than before. (I told them what was going on and they didn’t see any glaring issue with the brake lines or leaks but didn’t inspect beyond that because they don’t do brake work).

Byful (Score: 0): Ask him if the front brakes are seized. If they get seized. Not only will they smoke, but they'll also start boiling the brake fluid which will make your brakes feel soft and spongy. Not to mention your fighting against your brakes trying to accelerate.

The ABS, traction control, and service stabilink is usually caused by a bad wheel speed sensor. I don't believe those are built into the wheel hub, just bolted in.

It's possible the excessive heat cooked that sensor."

When testing on the lot, it started on the first try for like 0.5 seconds, but then turned off. After that, only cranking, no starting.

After some research and diagnosing, I found out that the fuel pump was not priming at all, no sound or anything, so I checked the fuse and the relay. They seemed to be fine (later found out it was the relay). There was no pressure in the fuel rail, so I changed the pump. Still didn't prime and found out the hard way it was the relay.

Well, now that seems to be working fine (not sure about pressure though, I don't have a gauge for it), but it's still not starting.

I took my car into a Firestone about a month ago because my steering wheel would shake whenever I pressed my brakes. Turned out the rotors were glazed so I got the brakes replaced/brake fluid replaced. Well as soon as I got my car back I noticed some squeaking. I was thinking maybe the brakes needed to be broken in but after a week or two I was still hearing it. So I called the Firestone, told them what was going on, and set an appointment for later in the week to bring my car back and have them check on it. Well the day of my appointment comes and they call me to cancel it because the mechanic that works on that stuff wasn’t going to be there. Ok. So I reschedule to this weekend, drop the car off and end up getting the inspection report. It says I need to replace the brakes and the brake fluid. I call to confirm what’s going on and the person said that my front right brake retainer clip was missing, so the brakes had been wearing unevenly and needed replaced. I asked if the clip was missing when I first brought it in and he said no, that it must’ve disintegrated in the last few weeks that I had been driving it. I asked if there was that severe of damage notated the first time I brought the car in. He said there was some regular wear and tear but nothing serious. Ok. So then why did it “disintegrate” in the last month? He didn’t really have an answer. He said that they could replace my brakes at no cost but I would just have to pay for the clip. This was on Sunday, fast forward to today (Wednesday) and I still done have my car, so I have my fiancé call to see what’s going on. Now they’re saying that I need to replace the calipers because they’re bad too, again, not something that was noted on the vehicle inspection report the first or second time. Am I going crazy? Is this normal? Also, can brake fluid go bad in a month or did they just never change it in the first place? I’m so frustrated and I don’t know what to do. 

ETA 2: I called corporate and made my concerns known and right after that I got a call from the store saying it’s actually NOT the calipers, the rotors they put on were too small and they will be replacing them at no charge (no shit) 🙃 so I guess that’s good news

Far-Improvement-9266 (Score: 2): Honestly, I would have to look at your vehicle, and there is likely a YouTube video to show how to bypass this, but, the heater control valve controls the flow of hot water through your heater core, which is basically a mini radiator in your dashboard. That heater core is what the blower motor blows it's air across to create heat in the cabin.

The heater control valve is controlled by a vacuum line that is connected to your heater control panel. If the heater control valve is bad, it won't open the valve and let the hot water flow through the heater core.

Bypassing the heater control valve basically makes it so that the hot water from your engine cooling system is allowed to bypass the valve and flow into the heater core. 

If you get heat after bypassing, it could still be either the heater control valve or the control panel, but you pretty much narrow it down to those two items. 

If it works on the bypass, replace the heater control valve (since that is cheapest) and hook up the lines normally and see if it works.

If it doesn't,  good chance it is your panel.

Honestly I hadn't even considered Cupra this time last week... I've mainly been looking at lightly used R's (I miss my 7.5r), black editions, standard 8.5s etc etc.

Anyway I've come across a few listings for relatively new Cupra Leons, some even 25 plates.

See [here](https://www.autotrader.co.uk/car-details/202510097015989), [here](https://www.autotrader.co.uk/car-details/202510207274242) and [here](https://www.autotrader.co.uk/car-details/202510147140178).

My question is, are how at some of these at near enough £30k? That's near enough a 40% drop and it's not even been a calendar year yet?

Is it due to

* New car losing at least 20% the moment you drive it off
* Cupra not being as established/desirable as the German brands ~ VW, Audi etc etc.
* Something else?

1ok747t,Sporty Estate Recommendations?,"Hi,

My current car is a 2009 Mazda2 and I’m ready to upgrade to something a bit more practical and a bit more fun to drive. My budget is £15,000–£20,000 and I’d like a sporty estate that still gives a decent balance between performance and running costs.

Here’s what I’m after:

* Budget: £15k–£20k (open on mileage/age for the right car). Could bump up the range if the right car falls within it. 
* Driving: Engaging to drive — I want something that feels alive on twisty roads, not just a heavy cruiser.
* Economy: Reasonable — I’m fine with sacrificing a bit of MPG for the fun factor, but nothing ridiculous to run day-to-day
* Spec must-haves: High spec trim ideally — panoramic roof is a must, nice infotainment, leather or heated seats would be great
* Practical stuff: Good boot space, decent rear passenger room and easy visibility for city driving
* Other wants: Decent insurance group (I don’t want sky-high premiums), not a nightmare to maintain, good reliability reputation.

A few more details about how I’ll use it:

* Mostly commuting + weekend trips; occasional motorway runs
* Auto transmission
* < 80k miles

What I’d love:

* Specific models/trims that fit this brief (and what to look for on that model)
* Common issues to watch for at \~£15–20k price points (what breaks, expensive items, rust spots, DSG/Twin-clutch issues, etc.)
* How much wiggle room I should expect on price for good-condition examples with high specs (and panoramic roof)
* Insurance/tax considerations or other running-cost surprises I might not think of
* Any alternatives I might have overlooked

Now I haven’t contacted the warranty company yet as from reading documents on my plan they will only cover the actual failure of a part. Which hasn’t happened yet unless I can argue the guides have failed?

They would need to have this Inspected and have one opportunity to fix the car before you can reject it. Bear in mind though they can just put thicker oil in and stop a rattle of a timing chain. Hopfully they’ll do it properly. 

If you contact them and they refuse to do anything your next bet is to get an independent inspection of the car, if they find something to be wrong email this to the dealership, if they still choose to do nothing, contact citizens advice and they’ll talk you though your next legal steps.

Personally it’s a long fight if it’s a shit dealership who refuse to ignore your concerns and it take take a long time to sort it. But the laws on your side.

But if you plan to keep the car like the car and don’t want the headache my personal advice is save up abit and get the chain done properly. At least you know it’s been done right and not just had some cheap parts / thicker oil cchucked into it.

The problem comes in the fact that all belts degrade over time and because the belt is run through engine oil the bits work their way into the engine and cause catastrophic issues. If the oil is changed regularly and the belt is inspected regularly they can be ok.

The problem is the belt is encased and really hard to inspect and people don't always change their oil regularly.

I want a big boot as I carry a lot of kit for work, and would love to be able to fit small-medium items of furniture in with back seats folded if possible (this would be a luxury). I'm thinking I might want something more upright for comfort - I get a lot of lower back and shoulder pain so it definitely needs to be comfy (I have good mobility but I'm just very achey). But with all this, I don't want anything huge and my maximum budget will probably be around 10k (8 or 9k would be MUCH more preferable).

I currently have an Audi A5 2019, 35TFSI, Petrol. I pay roughly £360 a month on PCP, I got it second hand in 2021, with only 7k miles on the clock, it now has 79k. My PCP agreement was 15000 miles a year. I ended up doing nearly 20-25k a year, due to moving house and work mileage, all sort of unforeseen before purchasing the car. I love the car, it was worth it to me at the time and the time since I've had it, very fun to drive, I just wish i'd paid the extra to have the mileage sorted out. 

  
Anyway my PCP ends in 2026, around June Time. I of course am over in mileage, by that time probably 15000-20000 miles over, at something stupid like 30p a mile charge. So i'd end up owing like 6k in fees. The plan is to chop it in for a part ex or sale privately to avoid this, and hope i can clear off the finance with that. The car needs some work, roughly £1000 ive been quoted for some body damage it had in a small collision. I wont claim on insurance as being under 25, my excess was £800, and then i'd lose no claims etc etc. 

  
The car has around £11000 left in early settlement today. Value I seem to be at about that, maybe £12000-13000, for a private sale. Part ex all want to be around £9000-10000, leaving me quite short.

1ojwdia,"Bought first car second hand, worried about registration oddity.","Hey all.

Bought my first car a few days ago, used of course. I taxed the car using the V5C that was with the car, but it wasn't in the seller's name and was missing a section. I also insured the car so I could legally drive it home.

I was informed that I should instead send a V62 to request a new V5C/logbook to transfer ownership so I did that, included the old V5C in the previous owners name (not the seller), and a cover letting explaining the situation, naming the seller and the registered keeper listed on the V5.

I was worried that I had done something wrong so I called the DVLA this morning to explain everything for peace of mind, they told me I had done nothing wrong which was a great relief. 

But here's where it seemed strange to me. I asked them if they could bring up who the current registered keeper actually is, to which he responded that there currently isn't one. I ran everything past him again and he reassured me I had done nothing wrong, so I let him on with his calls and hung up, and immediately started to think ""how does a vehicle have NO registered keeper?"".

Anyone heard of this before? How does this happen? Should I call back for further clarification or just let th V62 application run it's course now?

1ojvdny,Renewal Went From £60PM to £110PM,"Hello,

My renewal quote from 1st central nearly doubled from last year, on comparison sites I’m getting quotes in the range of £140pm to £200pm for a similar comprehensive deal. 

So the website is currently showing £110, which I have the option to lock in. However my friend advised me to give them a ring and say that I’m unhappy with the quote, and to say other companies have offered me a cheaper price, and that I will switch.

However, I have seen reviews on Google saying 1st central charge a fee to view quotes via call, and that someone did the same thing and the quote they gave on call was double of what it showed on the website, also updated the quote on the website to this new price. 

I would like to try my luck to see if I can get it a bit lower, because mines nearly doubled! But I really don’t wanna chance it going up. 

ChatGPT told me this 
“But if they re-rate your policy on the phone (fresh quote), you might lose the online discount and see it increase further (sometimes up to double).
That story you heard — yes, it’s true in principle. Many people report that after calling, First Central (and others like Hastings/Admiral) give a phone-quote price higher than the online one because phone sales trigger a different pricing channel.
Honestly — don’t lie, especially with First Central.
They can immediately see market averages through price-comparison databases (CUE, LexisNexis). If you say “another company offered me £90” and they see nothing close to that, it kills credibility and they’re less likely to help.
So: if the £110 figure is showing on your online renewal portal and still valid, lock it in online — don’t risk the call.”

Any advice would be great. I’m a 52 year old man with my 20 year old son on the policy. Quotes on comparison sites for me alone are around £30-£40pm.

Weirdly, on moneysupermarket, putting my son as the main driver drops the quotes to £140, whereas putting me as main raises it to £190 for some weird reason.

It's essentially a DPF for a petrol vehicle. Much less problematic in theory and practice. It helps that DPFs have been around for a long time to learn and build up design wise, and petrol exhaust gases get hotter to burn particulate from the filter anyway.

In terms of effect on the vehicle, there will be very little noticeable effect. The engine has been tuned to accommodate the GPF in the exhaust system, so performance doesn't suffer at a stock level. As far as sound goes, it may sound different externally, but not much, and you wouldn't notice anyway because you'll be inside the car hearing nothing but the fake sound played through the speakers, as is the way with 99% of modern cars.

A GPF does mean the potential for more maintenance in the future, and also means you have to ensure you drive distances that allow for a full regeneration. If the engine performs an active regen, you don't want to interupt that too often. Otherwise, excess fuel will cause oil dilution that can lead to issues.

I would never actively avoid a car with a DPF or GPF as a rule because nowadays, the technology is reliable. A very few cars have systems that aren't as good as others but still work fine with proper driving for a car with a particulate filter.

Buy on condition and service history. Don't worry about GPF.

1oju2k5,Project dilemma : “Two-car dream or one rotary love?”,"**Hi everyone,**

I know I’ll probably get roasted for these options, but hear me out first!  
I’ve got a fair bit of experience with cars and I’m fairly mechanically inclined :)

I currently own a 5th-gen BB6 Honda Prelude with an H22 — it’s manual, has around 90k miles, and is in mint, mostly stock condition. It’s sitting on coilovers with Recaro seats, and honestly, I absolutely adore it. Such a blast to drive.

I’ve got a bit of spare cash lying around, so I’m debating whether to upgrade or pick up another project next to It.

So, the options are:  
**1.** Add a bit on top and buy a low-mileage RX-8 R3.  
Before anyone says it — yes, I *know* how temperamental they are. I actually owned an RX-8 for five years and daily-drove it for about 60k miles. I loved the way it handled and the attention it got (it looked quite rare and modern — probably helped that it had a Rocket Bunny kit, lol).  
That said, I remember dailying it wasn’t always fun… though I do miss the way it felt to drive.

**2.** Keep the Prelude and pick up an MG TF as a second car.  
I love having multiple cars and lining them up in the garage like Hot Wheels — it genuinely feeds my soul. Plus, I like having options!  
The plan would be to eventually turbo the Prelude for track use, and keep the MG TF as a weekend top-down cruiser.

I really miss rx8 how It looked and handled. But I also want to have a hobby garage like thingy.

Would love to hear some opinions :)

The 118d engine is rubbish though and as other commenters have said they’re known to throw timing chains and generally just aren’t reliable. Less likely to throw a chain or fail if it’s been properly maintained, however at £2k I’d guess the service history isn’t comprehensive, although I might be wrong. 

If you’re on a budget and want a BMW just understand it’s a lot more likely to fail or throw up a dirty great bill compare to say a cheap Civic or Corolla. Quite a high chance of it needing thousands spent on it and writing the car off. Respectfully if you’re only spending £2k on a car I highly doubt you’re in a position to foot a 4 figure bill if the chain goes. And even if you were in a position to keep it on the road spending lots on maintenance, a knakered old 1 series is NOT special enough to warrant thousands on repairs.

Ultimately there are much better ways of spending £2k on a hatchback. If you REALLY have to have something with a nicer badge maybe look at Golf’s with the 1.9pd engine. The most sensible option at this kind of price would be a Civic/Corolla/Golf imo though.

My car has been sitting on my drive for 2 months + and I need it to get to work. I'm taking 2hr+ journeys where it would be 30 mins by car.

Issue:
My car has stopped unlocking/ locking and turning on. The battery and everything else is probably fine. I had tried everything I can (except a new trick I found).

Call:
I called a company called Car Keys Solutions South Norwood

I told the man on the phone my issues and what they can do to help. I asked would they charge me full amount if they couldnt find a fault? The man said why would we? I said ok.

The charged a deposit of £150. I thought they were a legitimate shop. 

Incident:
The autolocksmith comes and the company was a different name: OG mechanics

He inspected the car. He couldn't read any codes or connect his obd2 scanner.

He took out the EIS (ignition switch). Then he opened the EIS box. Soldered some stuff onto the board. Then he and I could see the code. He tried adding a new key 🗝️.

He tested it, didn't work. He tried 'fixing it'.
And it was probably at this point I should have said no because he did something strange for a while by soldering some stuff and heating the board. He must have realised he f**** the board and gave up.
But he didn't tell me that. He came out the van and said on the lines of 'I don't know bro. I can't find the problem. The next fix is the EIS but it's not a guarantee'. 

He told me to give up and don't bother. This was supposed to be their best of the best auto locksmith that specialises on Mercedes.
He said it would cost £600+ for an used EIS or £1000 for a new one.
 
I thought this was extortion, as others quoted me £150 for cloning. And the car isn't worth more than £2500 - 3000.

He didn't mention he corrupted my EIS. 
I was in a worse position because of this guy's work.

Next autolocksmith:
I booked another autolocksmith to clone my eis. that should have fixed it but it wasn't his fault because unbeknownst to me and them the EIS was corrupted.
These guys seemed legit and friendly. They didn't bother charging me the full £150 because they were honest, only the call out charge.
I really regret not going with these guys first.
They said it has been worked on and the last person to work on it has damaged it.

Afterwards:
I opened the board to confirm what he said. And sadly it was true. The board looked fried in some spots. 
And sometimes the worker can corrupt it if they work the code or solder (by shorting it).
I found another mechanic on the phone told me.
The also said the first autolocksmith that can came was known to him. Many people have had terrible experiences with them and how they will charge too much and have terrible repairs policies.

Support request:
Finding this out, I felt so stressed and upset.
I am in a worse position that would originally cost me £150 to fix and now probably £650 (very lucky for the company).
I spoke to the company and they were not apologising or offering any form of compensation.

They have blocked my whatsapp from messaging them. I haven't been rude but just asked for some help.

They didn't disagree that the man on the phone from the company, told me they wouldn't charge if they don't find an actual cause.


Finally for you:
Anyone have any ideas on what I should do?
£150 for me is many days work.
This is a lot of money for me to waste.
Plus the £100 I paid for another mechanic not knowing eis was damaged.
I'm willing to take them to small claims court because they damaged my car part.

1ojlj47,I want to mirror polish my wheels instead of diamond cut now any advice ?,Everyone said diamond cut will go bad quickly so I’m really wanting the shiny shiny look so maybe mirror polished wheels to match the badges and exhaust will be a better option? ,5,1761784138.0,16,CartalkUK,1761939300,2025-10-30 00:28:58,2025-10-31 19:35:00,"ShadowyModi (Score: 13): No fucking clue mate but I just wanted to say

sneekeruk (Score: 4): Its the same, well, in that its bare metal and has no protection. You would have to polish them every week or so just to keep them from pitting.

When I say its the same, its the same end result. Diamond cutting you skim a thin layer of metal off the highest parts leaving the bare metal. Polishing is a bit more labout intensive. You strip the wheels, then polish with finer and finer grades of sandpaper/wire wool, then metal polish.  Again, after all this, you have to polish them regularly to stop them from tarnishing. And you cant use them if they ever salt the roads.

That said, I  saw  an e92 yesterday and the guy had chrome powdercoat. Looked good from 10ft away and still 80% of the shinyness of polished wheels.

1ojlcb8,should i go through insurance to repair my keyed car?,"For some background information, I’m 18, had my car since August 2024 and I’ve been driving since December 2024. I previously made a post on my car being keyed if anyone’s interested but to sum it up my cars got two key marks on each side, one is especially bad going from back to front and the other side is just on the door. My dad might be able to buff it out as best he can, but in the case he can’t should I go through insurance? I mean from looking at other posts I can guess it would probably cost just under £1k out of pocket which I very much cannot afford. I could claim on insurance but would it just increase it even through it is completely not my fault and just unprovoked. My insurance is already very expensive and I wouldn’t want it to increase. I guess I could just leave it but I love my car and want to have pride in it again, it looks like such a shit box with the massive scratches. Just annoying that this is what insurance is for… but I don’t feel confident to go through them. I’m in the process of getting some footage that hopefully can indicate who did it, and even then will my insurance still increase when they can see it wasn’t my fault?? Idk feeling very powerless and pissed off at the whole thing

They ended up paying out the full pre-accident value instead of authorising the cheaper repair, which meant I got paid but it was a big inconvenience because I would have preferred to just have the car fixed.

What car is it? Age/mileage/condition (excluding key marks)?

If it’s just damaged the paint you could look at chipex kit. I think it will be a bit too much for it but it’s £40 and cleaning the car rather than hundreds at a body shop.

Unfortunately it will be far from good but good from far situation."
