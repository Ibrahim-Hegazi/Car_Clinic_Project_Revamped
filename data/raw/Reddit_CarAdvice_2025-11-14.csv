1owh8d8,Idle Relearn Made My Car Worse?,"I drive a 2014 Subaru Forester (manual) and this morning out of the blue my car started stalling when coming to stops in neutral. It happened multiple times on the way to work unless I rode the accelerator a little. Drove fine while in higher gears but low speeds caused it to stall in the lower gears. I tried my best to diagnose the issue while working today. During lunch for some reason my car seemed to correct a little but was still idling rough and low on RPM’s. I came down to cleaning the mass air flow sensor and running an idle reset. I did the air flow sensor first and still had a rough idle so I moved on to an idle reset. Disconnected the battery for 30 minutes (and cleaned off some corrosive buildup on the positive terminal) and the followed all the steps to a T. During the first 10 minute idle it seemed to be doing much better. I then followed up with the power off, and then restart to idle for another five minutes and it stalls immediately.

1owggnr,Am I being overcharged for a “power steering pump” on my 2012 Grand Cherokee? Shop says it’s electric-hydraulic.,"Hey all, I’m looking for a sanity check from people who know these WK2s or work in the industry.

I have a 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited, 3.6L Pentastar, and my power steering was stiff. A local shop told me the power steering pump needed replacement.


They quoted me this:
Rebuilt P/S Pump (part 52124998AJ) — $1,629.60

They said “list price is $2,250”

They told me it’s a “more expensive electric-hydraulic pump”

Labor is $543.15

Total for the pump replacement is around $2,300



After looking into it, I can’t find any evidence that this engine uses an electric-hydraulic pump. Everything says the 2012 3.6L uses a standard belt-driven hydraulic pump, which normally retails for $300–$600 OEM or $150–$300 reman.

I already initially said OK to the quote, but now I'm regretting it because the explanation doesn’t line up with what this vehicle actually uses.


My questions:

1. Does a 2012 Grand Cherokee 3.6L actually have an electric-hydraulic pump?

2. Is $1,629 for this pump even remotely normal?

3. Is it reasonable to push back if I was given incorrect technical info when I approved the work?",1,1763076336.0,3,MechanicAdvice,1763148954,2025-11-13 23:25:36,2025-11-14 19:35:54,"Rebeldesuave (Score: 1): At least some of them did AFAIK. Shop this repair around.

3. If you’re uncomfortable with a diagnosis, it’s ok to ask questions in order to understand what/how/why/etc.  However, just pushing back for the sake of pushing back may lead to a shop not wanting to work on your vehicles."

I’m wondering if someone with knowledge about the air intake system including MAF sensors and fuel trim readings could help answer some questions.

I have a 2006 Prius with 160k miles. It’s had a p0420 code since I got it, but before replacing the cat I want to address what is causing it to fail. I clesned the MAF sensor to address a rough idle and weird fuel trim readings. It helped a bit but then a p0102 code popped up.

Before cleaning MAF sensor:
— Rough idle since I bought it. 
— LTFT readings were around +9 at idle, and increased slightly while accelerating. 
— STFT readings always slightly negative at idle but around 0 under load. 

After cleaning the MAF sensor:
— LTFT readings consistently +4.75 at idle and between +5 and +7 when my rpm increases. 
— STFT readings still are negative at idle and closer to 0 under load.  
— Rough idle improved but didn’t entirely disappear
— p0102 code appeared after about 500 miles of driving and about 2 weeks

What do you make of this? Does this indicate a vacuum leak? Is it something to do with the MAF sensor connections or fuses? Is it worth replacing the MAF sensor to see if it makes any difference? What are my next steps?

Borrow a jump pack and see if the battery's not the problems. It takes literally minutes.

The starter can be easily tested (off engine, don'trust those ""free tests"" car part stores offer) but those used on these MZ engines are really long lived. If the starter tests fine, very likely the problem is the ignition switch. It's the small electro-mechanical part at the end of the key cylinder. [This thing](https://parts.lexus.com/p/Lexus__ES-300/Ignition-Switch/62968513/8445012200.html) for reference. Those Lexus still used a 90s design that proved very prone to tear and wear. The switches you can buy now are supposedly much more long lived.

The brakes were VERY soft - pedal near the floor to brake. Without telling me, he had some shop look and they replaced the master cylinder - not sure what they charged.

He messaged me this morning to say they are charging him another $2k for the ""brake seal"". After talking with him and seeing what they told him, I THINK what they are saying is they ""suspect"" the master cylinder may have leaked brake fluid into the brake booster and they want to replace it. It looks like OEM booster is \~$400, so I can't imagine what the other $1600 is for, but it sounds extremely steep.

I haven't done much brake work, but I'm not a mechanical moron - I did all timing components and water pump DIY on my 2012 Acura TL SHAWD. So brake stuff is less familiar to me, but I can't imagine it's insurmountable.

Questions:

\- Am I crazy? $2k is WAY too much, yeah?

\- If they replaced the master cylinder, they should have already flushed/replaced/bled the fluid right? So I don't even need to deal with fluid to do the booster?

\- Booster swap is entirely in the cabin near the firewall right? Take a few hours tops?

\- What am I not thinking about?

You'll need to disconnect the lines at the master, unbolt and remove the master, disconnect the brake pedal from the booster, then unbolt the booster from the interior.

You'll then need to bench bleed the master before installing it, then bleed the entire brake system.

Recently had the head gasket, thermostat, and water pump replaced. Mechanic told me to take it easy for a bit and keep it under around 60 mph while everything goes through some heat cycles.

The engine itself runs fine and the temperature is stable, but I’ve noticed that once I go past around 60 mph, the steering wheel starts shaking. Under 60 it’s smooth.

I’m not sure whether this could be related to the engine/cooling system work, or if it’s more likely to be something like wheels, tyres, balancing, alignment, etc. Different people tell me different things — some say it’s unrelated, others say the car “needs to settle” after being opened up.

I’m just looking for opinions from people who know more about this:
Is there any realistic way engine/cooling work could cause a steering wheel shake at higher speeds, or should I be looking elsewhere?

My money is on the valve cover gasket, they put it on wrong and started leaking onto the exhaust headers and that’s the burning oil smell you are smelling. 


You need to take it back to them and have them re-check their work. And DO NOT let them sell you anymore parts.

1ow0u7y,Radiator fan,"Hello, all masters. I have a problem that has been going on for about half a year, that after I turn off the engine, the BMW G30 2.0l diesel decides to keep radiator fan on for about 5 minutes. This happens mainly only after short trips, if the trip is longer, this does not happen. The diagnostic currently does not show any errors. What could be the problem? DPF regeneration can be ruled out, the diagnostic shows that it happened properly some time ago.
P.S. In advance, I will mention that I waited so long because in the service they had said that everything was ok here, but now when I visited another one, they said that it was nonsense and definitely not ok, but in the absence of any errors, such a mess is obtained. So maybe someone who has encountered this will have some advice. One of the options that the guy in the service said is possibly due to the BMW grille not opening properly (it does not always open when it should), so he suggests replacing the motor, because the temperature can remain higher if the grille does not open. But sometimes it opens and the fan still works.

1ow8j04,I'm beyond confused (ABS/Traction light and Brake light problems),"I drive a 2014 Toyota Corolla, for context. Engine is 2ZR-FAE I believe since my corolla is the LE Eco version.

TLDR: ABS/Traction and BRAKE lights are on/off inconsistently when starting up car, and it is confusing me/the cause is super unclear, not sure if its safe to drive home. Suspect is a possible brake fluid leak (maybe???)

  
The long version:

One day on my way back home from work, I had the ABS light, the traction light (the one that looks like a car with sliding/skid marks below it), and the red BRAKE light that is usually on when my hand brake is still engaged. But it wasn't, so I pulled over to a parking lot and looked at the lights for a second. I decided to turn the car off and check what the problem could be. Right away on google it said that the car was not safe to drive if both the BRAKE light and the ABS/Traction lights were on. I turned the car back on to check and make sure that those were the lights that were in fact on. But this time, the BRAKE light wasn't on, just the ABS and Traction. After more research, I decided I was going to try to make it home. I avoided the freeway and just took the normal roads back home. Made it back safely, I asked my dad to come over and let me borrow his OBD scanner. 

However, the next day when he came over, I turned the car on and... none of the lights were on. Weird. In hindsight, I should have still scanned, but everything seemed normal again, so I just returned the scanner. A few days later, it happened again - my ABS/Traction light was on, (no BRAKE this time), turned off the car, and after a few hours I turned it back on and lights were gone. I'm so confused as to why this is happening.

Today, I was gonna grab some breakfast after getting to work, but when I started up my car at work the BRAKE and ABS/Traction lights came on again. I wouldn't be surprised if when I next check they'll be off again, but I'm getting really confused/concerned. I'm going to do a scan with the OBD Scanner when I can, but I'd rather not do it here at work. But I don't know if its safe to drive the car again under these conditions. I just wish I knew what was happening, its so random and inconsistent. Has ANYONE ever seen/heard of something like this? I know its a shot in the dark without scanner info, but everything I've looked up as possible causes don't seem to be the case. When I do drive the car, with these lights on, everything feels completely normal too, the brakes and everything, so idk whats going on.

Possibly unrelated but I think it might be good to mention. A month before this started happening I had some problems where, somehow, my car suddenly had no oil. We suspected a leak, but after refilling the oil and watching for a leak, while there was some on our driveway, it wasn't all that much and we chalked it up to spilling some while pouring (which we did). However, now there has been consistent, yet very small amounts, of leaking of SOMETHING. it looks like oil, but my oil levels are still pretty high since we filled it, maybe a bit lower? Could be a small, slow leak or some problem with the filter. But anyway it might be unrelated unless the leak is maybe the brake fluid? Its dark in color though so I'm not sure it is, but that maybe is a cause if so? The leak also feels more on the right side of the car as opposed to the left side, where I believe the brake fluid is. Idk.... im lost.

Quick addition after finishing this write up: Yep, its different now, started up the car 10 mins later (time it took me to write this) and the BRAKE light is off, ABS/Traction lights still on. I'm so confused as to why its different each time.",1,1763057821.0,2,carproblems,1763148954,2025-11-13 18:17:01,2025-11-14 19:35:54,paulyp41 (Score: 1): Most likely a wheel speed sensor

When I was driving it the other day my cab started to smell like burning coolant so I used one of those leak stoppers in the radiator and now it's essentially dumping any fluids I put in it onto the ground.

Any idea what the cheapest or easiest options to get it running again? I'd like it to become my daily work truck if possible. 

Thanks in advance, and any links to good sites to order from would be helpful.

1ovp9x1,My friend has a Chevy car and it's very slow to accelerate what can I look for in a scan tool to diagnose it,"Doesn't have any codes other than the EGR flow code that sometimes goes away. I actually cleaned the EGR ports but it may have got we clogged again I don't know. It wasn't that clogged to begin with.  I heard that's a sign of bad cat. Anyways I have a super cheap scan tool but it gives me a little bit of a live data. What should I look for in order to make sure that it is in fact a bad cat and this has three cats by the way it's V6. I only have access to three of the spark plugs because it's a V6 and the ones in the back are super hard to get to. I don't have any special tools or clipping things that mechanics do to get back there. The car runs very good like it starts up good and accelerates like has a lot of power it wants to it's just very slow and sluggish. It does make a ticking noise but I don't have any codes like misfire or anything only code is the EGR code.  

I've cleaned the throttle body and the MAF sensor and I've dumped like 2 gallons worth of fuel cleaners in there over the last year.

It's a Chevy Malibu V6 2000 era. Like 2004-2008 but I think it's one of the earlier years.

The car also tends to overheat a little bit it'll go like a little bit over the line not that much and it's gets very very hot. I also heard as a sign of bad cat. If it is a bad cat is it possible I can just get in there with some kind of rotary tool or like a pipe or a long metal stick and I can just punch out the cat without taking it off the comb I mean. From the O2 ports.

I also drained and put fresh coolant in there about 6 months ago so it has a good coolant and it's still overheats. Unfortunately I think that the coolant drain plug which is the petcock wasn't completely closed or sealed which I heard is a problem in this car also so it reeks of coolant and maybe there's air getting in the system from there which also could be causing problems. I did bleed out the system through the proper bleed Port which is on the top of the car. To get to this petcock you have to take off this bracket underneath the car and then the radiator drops down some and then you have to sneak around and get to the petcock and I wasn't able to do that so somebody help me with like really long arms and skinny who could get in from the top but I can't do that cuz it's like being a contortionist which is the reason why it's probably not very well sealed because you know it's very hard to tighten up a bolt at an angle with your hand when you can't see anything.

But I realized after fitting it that thermostats for Corolla 2014 LE typically are rated 180F, and now I’m worried it’s gonna ruin the longevity of engine oil and the engine. Idk maybe you guys can educate me and lmk if I should be worried or any risks I should be concerned about. At the end of the day I’m grateful the replacement went well and a slightly lower optimal engine temperature is much better than a full cold engine temperature (yeah I had a stuck open thermostat). So Alhamdulilah. Also additional information, the heater works very well while filling the coolant system with the old coolant I had to drain from the car for the thermostat repair. Engine reaches a temperature level right before optimal, I can add the picture later, but as you guys know, it will always be 10F below ideal engine operating temp and idk if this is something to be worried about.

All the new thermostat will do is begin opening a little early, so your car will get to temperature slower. And it will be fully open at or slightly before normal operating temperature.

This is a problem if you only drive like 5-10 minutes a day at 35-45 mph as that isn't a lot of time to get the engine up to temperature. It could eventually lead to faster wear due to the oil not getting to efficient temperature. And when the oil is hot it doesn't collect water and fuel as easily as when it's colder, so these short commutes and cold temperatures could foul your oil overtime. But we're talking about operating like this for YEARS, and it is meaningless if your daily commute is like 20-30 minutes on the highway, these concerns start minimizing.

The heater will also suck in winter if it gets very cold where you live, as it will take longer for the heater core to get the full engine heat. To me, that might be the deal breaker and worth the swap next coolant fluid exchange.

Edit: I would also double check that the type you got fails ""open"" and not closed. I'd rather have my coolant running through the engine all the time versus never running at all.

Took it to a local shop, and they said a rodent chewed on the transmission wires, breaking them. They sent me these photos (sorry that some are blurry). So two questions arise here:

1. Does that look like rodent damage is actually the case? Or does it appear to be something wrong with the wire itself? For more context, I bought this car used about 5 months ago (at 28k, now 34k miles). I drive this car almost every day and haven't noticed any issues before this. I also looked under the hood before it was taken to the shop and didn't notice anything to suggest rodent presence (no nests, no droppings, nothing). None of my roommates' cars were busted, either.
2. If it is rodent damage, how can I protect against it in the future? I've looked around and seen different suggestions (traps, peppermint spray, spicy wire tape, all that), but I wonder if there are specific measures to take for a car that lives outside, especially as winter starts to come around (I live in New England, aka rat paradise, and my apartment doesn't have a garage).

Would love y'all's takes on this. Thanks!

Last Friday, discovered coolant was bone dry.  I have no idea how long or what damage had already occurred at that point.

So I did my research and decided as long as I added coolant I could probably drive it a tiny bit more.  Wouldn't be able to get it to my mechanic 'til Monday anyway, and here it is Thursday - LIFE!  

So I put coolant in it that night (50/50 mix) and drove it about 20 minutes. During that drive, a new symptom began. It started lurching or losing acceleration sometimes, which had not happened until after I put more coolant in. I drove slowly and tried to accelerate slowly when necessary.  Got to my dad's house with the kids and the van.  

Now I need to get it to my mechanic's garage (about a 10 minute drive) and I'm just wondering if I really need to spend money on the tow or if you all think I could just top up the coolant again and drive it there.

1ovofwa,"2018 Nissan Titan XD, 5.0L Cummins Catastrophic Runaway","For context, I’m a 3rd year diagnostic tech at a private party shop. Long story short, I had an 18 Titan with a 5L Cummins runaway on me during test drive after a compound turbo replacement. Seeking advice. 

Vehicle was checked in as “Loss of power while driving, CEL on”. Initial inspection showed no oil in the motor, an intercooler full of oil and a chewed on high pressure turbo speed sensor. Also important to note that this vehicle was DPF deleted. Teardown found about 1.5 gals of oil just in the intercooler, plenty of oil scattered throughout intake and exhaust system, including the EGR. High pressure turbo quite literally came apart. Recommended turbos (compound, so high and low pressure), high pressure turbo speed sensor, and thorough intake cleaning. Spent quite literally 2 weeks on R+R, cleaning the entire intake system and balancing diagnosis appointments. Flushed the intercooler til I was getting no oil coming out of it at all. When I got it all together, topped off oil and bled cooling system, I was surprised that it fired right up and idled great. Lots of smoke from the downstream of exhaust system, nothing abnormal for what was present. On the test drive however, I pulled out of the driveway of my shop and gave this truck the tiniest bit of throttle and it took off like a rocket. Instinctively, to stop the acceleration, I put it in neutral and the tach wrapped past redline. I shut ignition off, vehicle kept running. Pulled over on side of the road, maybe a block from the shop, and had a full runaway scenario. Worst nightmare type stuff. Blew a cloud big enough I got called into local PD as a vehicle fire. I was frantically trying to find a way to starve the intake, I didn’t have anything to pull a boot or the filter box off, and within a minute the motor knocked itself to a halt. Had it towed back to the shop, and today I started teardown. 

During second teardown, the first thing I was looking for was another turbo failure. Took a bit of digging to get back to them, but I did not find excessive shaft play or oil on the impeller side of either turbo. The intercooler now has about an inch of oil in it, EGR is basically full of oil, and the exhaust has way more oil in it than last time. Two broken glow plugs, cylinders 2 and 5 I believe. Have tried a crank and it sounds bad, think the lower rotating assembly must have come apart. I’m kicking myself for not recommending the intercooler to be replaced, but I’m ultimately on the fence about whether or not this is my fault. Any advice is greatly appreciated and welcomed. Idk what to do, I’ve been documenting everything through the process of the second teardown to cover my ass in case of a BAR reprimand, but I’m so worried this motor replacement is ultimately going to cost the shop. Shop wants to blame Cummins for the turbos and get them to pay for the motor. I just want to sleep at night knowing I did my due diligence through diag and repair.

   When it came in originally did you do any diagnostic testing to see if you still had a viable patient for new turbos? Any kind of compression or leak down testing? Borescope inspection of anything? The tear down is going to be where the diagnosis will have to come from. I bet you had a piston or two that had already been damaged and it was blowing oil into the manifold once it warmed up. Sorry you had to have that experience, but it is experience, learn as much as you can from it and use it for a reference next time. You could have called out the inter cooler and still had a runaway. I hope you get to pull it apart and find out just what happened, having to wait for Cummins to do it just doesn’t give you the satisfaction of determining the cause yourself."

1ow0uky,Volvo CEM IMMO PIN,"Hi everyone,

I have recently taken up the adventure of cracking my Volvo V70 P2 from 2007 wide open, partly to take full control over my car, and mainly to change the default audio system, with plans to install another radio capable of Android Auto with a subwoofer in my trunk.

After getting the usual things like the Super J2534 (or Mongoose Pro JLR) and VIDA and VDASH installed, only then I realized I need the PIN to my CEM. So I built this (https://github.com/vtl/volvo-cem-cracker) Volvo CEM PIN Cracker and it actually worked!

However, after opening VDASH connected to my car I realized, there is even MORE PINS??? After clicking on the Security Tab I tried decoding this ""CEM IMMO"" PIN, however it doesn't even start. I saw some Audio settings being greyed out so (something about MOST, which I shouldn't have, the HU-650 being installed from the factory) I thought that I have to get this PIN to achieve what I want to do.

So, 3 questions:

1. Do I even need to get this PIN for changing the radio (to 3rd party one)?

2. What exactly does this CEM IMMO PIN enable me to do?

3. Is there any way I can use OBDII to do this or do I have to disassemble my car to get to my CEM directly?

Similarly gear oil has a high sulphur content which can react with some metals and materials, especially copper in brake pads to form copper sulphide especially under the heat an operational brake system can produce.

1owe5cp,Mechanic says I should get a new car because of oil leak. Overreaction or genuine immediate concern?,"For context, I recently posted about an issue with my oil being overfilled and the low oil pressure light popping on (2011 Buick Lucerne, 3.9L V6). I had a different mechanic test the oil pressure and it was normal, so he will be replacing the sensor soon. 

I went back to the mechanic who overfilled to talk with him; he didn't get back to me on the phone when I contacted about it. He said the entire underside was coated with oil, indicating a leak, so he overfilled to compensate. He also said he checked thoroughly and couldn't figure out where the leak is coming from. Since it isn't somewhere obvious, he figures that the car is so old that it'd be better to just get a new car as soon as possible instead of doing any more work on it.

There has never been any noticeable oil under the car on the driveway, so I assume the leak isn't too fast. The only other issue he mentioned on it aside from a leak is that the lug nuts are seized on the front left wheel (he had also replaced a tie rod end for me). 

It seems like a bit much to write the car off for that, but I am certainly not an expert. Does this hold any weight or is his reaction overdramatic?

Wheel vibration is balance, tire/wheel damage, alignment or suspension parts.

Bradparsley25 (Score: 7): It’s likely a wheel balance issue at a speed like that. More annoying than dangerous.

That said, it could also be something wild like a loose wheel or a bearing that’s coming apart, but that would probably be also making scary noises.

I’d say get your wheel balance redone. If you had tires installed recently (the past month), get them to warranty it.

Badly worn tires CAN create vibrations but unless they’re severely fucked up, it won’t shake the steering wheel like that.

You also run into it where some shops won’t rebalance tires that are badly worn… so that could be why they suggested tires. Reason being is that often you rebalance the badly worn tires, the car vibrates anyway, and then the customer is pissed cause they spent money on a balance and it didnt fix it.

What were the tire measurements they gave you when they suggested them?"

My question is can I do this say every 6 years or will that probably cause a problem?  Basically unless I'm 99.5% sure waiting 6 years will make no difference than 3 years, than I wouldn't risk it.

Thoughts?","**TL;DR:** I have a nail in the *front-right* tire that’s on the **edge of the tread**. My other three OEM Kumho Crugen HP71s are at about **5–6 (remaining)** and \~27k miles. I drive an AWD SUV (235/55R19). Should I repair the one tire, replace the 1 or 2 front tires, or replace all 4? If replacing all 4 I’m choosing between **Michelin Primacy** or **DWS06+** — any recommendations for Dallas (hot summers, heavy rain), mostly city driving + occasional long trips? I’m overwhelmed, thanks!

**More details:**

* Tire size: **235/55R19** (OEM: Kumho Crugen HP71).
* Mileage on tires: **\~27,000 miles**.
* Tread left on the other three: **about 5–6** (I’m measuring in the common scale — not sure if that’s 32nds or %; I can check).
* Problem tire: **front-right**, nail **on the edge of the flat tread surface / near the shoulder** (not dead center).
* Driving: mostly city in **Dallas** with some highway trips. Priorities: **quiet and strong braking/handling**.

**Questions:**

1. Is a puncture that’s on the *edge* of the tread usually repairable, or should I expect a replacement?
2. With AWD and the rest of the tires at \~5–6 remaining, do people recommend replacing **just the damaged tire**, **both front tires**, or **all four**? What would you do?
3. If I replace only 1 or 2, should I match the exact Kumho model, or is it OK to switch?
4. If I replace all four, between **Michelin Primacy** and **DWS06+** (or other suggestions), which would you pick for Dallas (prioritizing quiet + braking/handling over maximum tread life)? Any real-world experience appreciated.
5. Any shops in the Dallas area that are fair/reliable for inspection and matching tires on an AWD SUV?

**What I’ve been told / what I’m thinking:**

* I’ve heard punctures on the shoulder/edge are sometimes *not* safely repairable — not sure if that’s the case here.
* I’ve also heard AWD vehicles can be sensitive to different tire circumferences; not sure how strict that is. I’m leaning toward either matching the OEM if I only replace one/two, or switching to Michelin Primacy if all four need replacement.

Not saying this is an issue your car has, just saying your assumption that the level is related to the oil life remaining is a bit funny lol.

This issue is that it will occasionally just stop moving part way through a cycle (not at the start or end) for anywhere from 10 to 30 seconds before continuing again. A couple of days ago while driving home at night they stopped completely and wouldn't come back on. Thankfully it was only raining lightly and I was close to home. I tried them again today and they're working fine again, didn't pause once.

The fact that the washer and rear wipers are working ok make me think it's not the fuse, and if it was the wiper motor dying I'd have thought I'd see it struggling. If it is working it works fine.

Could it be a wiring issue or a leak? If so, where should I start looking to diagnose a possible cause?

In among the paperwork from the previous owner I can see a wiper motor was replaced due to water getting into it a couple of years ago.

Personally, much as I like the Japanese stuff (Jazz, Yaris, etc), you do tend to have to pay more for them because of their good reputation. So a Hyundai i20 or Kia Picanto wopuld be my default go-to; the high-spec models have ridiculous amounts of gadgets, e.g. this [14-plate Kia Picanto '4' for £2990](https://www.autotrader.co.uk/car-details/202510046885818). 98k miles, MOT to next September and the [history is very clean](https://www.check-mot.service.gov.uk/results?registration=ks14ocf).

The Fiesta you need to avoid is the 1.0L ""Ecoboost"" which has a wet belt. They're ok IF you service them frequently AND you change the belt regularly, but that's expensive. And neglect leads to critical failure much quicker than on cars with normal belts or chains. You might get lucky, but why take the risk when there's safer stuff out there?

You will get stung on higher road tax and they are treated as private good vehicles...ie £360 for an a4 2.0 tfsi quattro which sucks as it is a load of garbage and could be resolved with a test.  But that's the price, you have to suck it up.  Insurance will be slightly higher.  Mine was about a £50 premium compared to a UK car.

The Excel (2018) is a higher trim level, is 2 years newer but has done significantly more miles.

I must admit the higher trim level is appealing, but I realise that the extra features are probably ultimately irrelevant. 

I suppose my questions are:  
\- Should the extra miles on the Excel (2018) put me off?    
\- IS 86,000 mile ultimately still pretty good for a Yaris hybrid?  
\- Are the extra features of the Excel (2018) worth it? (I'm still not quite sure what these are tbh)   
\- Is there much benefit in buying direct from the Toyota garage (Design 2016)  
\- Which ultimately do you think is the better buy?

Given that it's nine years old, I'm going to guess it's probably being sold because it's getting to the end of its Lexus Relax qualification.

This is a program that Lexus offer where if you keep your car serviced with a Lexus dealer, it automatically keeps your warranty rolling after the inital three years is up, extending it year on year up until 100,000 miles or when the car is 10 years old, whichever comes first.

A lot of people who buy a Lexus will run it for the ten years, keeping a dealer service history, then sell it once it doesn't qualify any more, so generally they're well maintained and given the main demographic that buys their cars they don't really have a hard life where they get ragged around.

The 1.8 that's in them isn't anything to write home about in terms of performance but it's absolutely bulletproof. It's been used in three generations of the Toyota Prius with a few tweaks, from 2009 right up to the current one that's on sale now, as well as other Toyota models including the Auris, C-HR and the Corolla.

While the gearbox is marketed as an eCVT, it's not a traditional CVT with belts and pulleys. It's part of the Toyota Hybrid Synergy Drive system, and is made up of a planetary gear set with a motor generator that controls the split of power between the ICE and the Hybrid system's motor, which gives the efficiency of a CVT without the belts and pulleys, so feel free to ignore people screeching about ""CVT=BAD!""

I currently have a Vauxhall Astra but I’m about £4.5K in negative equity. I do around 15K miles a year, with about two-thirds being motorway driving. I’ve been told that to make things affordable, I’d need to look at a PCP deal on a car worth around £7K, rolling the negative equity into it.

Most of the cars in that range are small hatchbacks, which I’m fine with, but they’re older than what I have now and would be a bit of a downgrade. It’s not ideal when my monthly payment is likely to go up rather than down. However, I am fully aware that the best way to get myself into a better position is to drive something like this for the next few years - at the end of the day a car is a car and as long as I can get about to see family and drive to work then I'm happy! 

My biggest concern is reliability. I’ve had a few issues with my Astra that have cost a fair bit in repairs, and I don’t want to be in the same situation again.  
I’ve owned a Fiesta and a Corsa in the past and liked both (except the Fiesta was the dreaded Ecoboom version). I’d prefer to avoid Vauxhall this time around if possible.

The Nissan is out of warranty and will probably break on the way home.
Please don't get a CVT Nissan.. it will fail. They are over 2k to buy and can't be repaired. It's a whole replacement unit.

1ovvuhs,Thoughts on this Octavia?,"What are people’s thoughts on this Octavia? Is the high mileage single ownership a concern? Could have been a taxi or fleet vehicle.

If it was just motorway miles on a company car not too worried because my previous car had well over 100k miles.

1ovv9nm,Handing car back after 5 months PCP,"Good morning, 

I got a car in July 2025 with 49k miles on it, the next week the engine failure light came on and it was taken back to the garage which they claimed was a “loose wire”. Everything was fine until last week when the engine failure light came back on, I phoned the garage where I bought it from again and they told me to bring it over the next day. I did just that and got stranded on the side of a motorway with no power. 

This car has had 2 engine faults in the 5 months I’ve had it. I have two very young children and now do not feel safe driving it, the car salesman has said to me that if it was him in this position he would want to hand it back. How likely am I able to hand this back? I have been warned by the salesman that there will be push back but surely 2 engine faults in 5 months and at 50k miles is cause for concern. 

Sorry if this doesn’t make much sense I currently have 2 toddlers at my feet and don’t have a car to get out 😵‍💫",3,1763020368.0,15,CartalkUK,1763148954,2025-11-13 07:52:48,2025-11-14 19:35:54,"Hungry-Fox1499 (Score: 8): Noting mine was brand new, when I had issues with a Mercedes under PCP I had no support from the dealership or Mercedes. I eventually went through the Financial Ombudsman and Mercedes Finance. Mercedes Finance sent out an independent engineer who confirmed the car didn’t meet the required standards. It took a while but they took it back, gave 100% of my deposit back and 20% of my PCP payments. I’d start with the Finance Company / Ombudsman, maybe?

CaptainAnswer (Score: 5): Move to rejection, get everything straight and timelined and write to them a letter recorded etc sent via email same day etc

As it failed within the 1st six months and they've already had one chance at repair you have the statutory consumer right to reject it now, them needing to get a new engine clearly demonstrates the car wasn't fit for purchase at the time you bought it. 

Go through the dealer, AND the finance company at the same time

Neat-Possibility6504 (Score: 3): I'd push very hard to take it back personally, make sure you got your facts straight though and don't agree to anything until you have checked it out, these car dealerships can and will run rings around people in these situations. Be wary the salesman also, he might be telling you one thing and the manger another. 

Safety wise, try not to worry though, an engine warning light is a problem and may leave you stuck somewhere but its not inherently unsafe."
1ovncdz,Speeding NIP issued 9 days after incident and delivered 18 days after incident,"I got a NIP for speeding, issues 9 days after the incident, and it was only delivered 18 days after the incident. I don't know why it took so long for me to receive it,  

I don't have a way to prove that it was delivered so late, unless the police have tracking on the postage.

Do I have grounds to challenged it via the 14 day rule for NIP to be delivered?",0,1762995658.0,4,CartalkUK,1763148954,2025-11-13 01:00:58,2025-11-14 19:35:54,"DerbyForget (Score: 12): Were you speeding on that date in that location and at that time?

If the answer is yes then I would advise you just accept that you broke the law and got caught.

Trying to weasel your way out of it on a technicality is never going to go down well in court. 

They've issued the NIP in time, the fact it arrived 4 days late could easily be explained by a slow postal service.

Take it on the chin as a learning experience. You may be offered a speed awareness course.

BoomSatsuma (Score: 3): I’m assuming you were speeding and the only defence you’ve got is that you received ‘late’. 

The legal position is documents are considered served on the second business day after posting. This is why these documents are sent untracked to avoid confusion as to when they’re served. See Section 7 of the Interpretation Act 1978. 

Don’t think you’ve got any case to challenge here.
