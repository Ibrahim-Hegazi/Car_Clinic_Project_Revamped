1ngbsfj,2003 GMC Yukon XL 5.3 – Cluster and electronics only partially working,"Hey guys, I need some advice. I bought a 2003 GMC Yukon XL 5.3 SLT about 5 months ago. Mechanically it’s been perfect and always starts right up, but the electronics have been really weird.
From the beginning, the only things that worked on the cluster were the speedometer and RPM gauge. The fuel gauge, oil pressure, volt meter, etc. never came on, and neither did the radio or the power windows. But after driving it for hours, sometimes random things would start working – like the 4WD button light came on, the radio turned on/off, and some gauges started working, but it was never consistent.
Recently, after fixing the brakes and registering it, I took it for a long drive. The longer I drove, the better it got. The radio started working for 10 minutes at a time, then cut out, then came back. The windows also started working, and eventually, after about an hour of driving, everything worked perfectly.
I drove it for a whole day like that, then parked it at a friend’s house. I tried locking it with the key fob but it stopped responding, and when I got back in, everything was dead again except for the RPM and speedometer. It’s been like that for the last two days.
So basically:
Speedo and RPM always work
All other gauges, radio, windows, 4WD switch only work sometimes (usually after driving for a long time)
Now they don’t work at all again

1ngahe1,Ford 5.8l efi tune help,"Trying to get my old truck running good, 1996/97 f250hd 5.8l efi. 

I got a 129 code which I looked up as map/maf incorrect reading. Truck doesn't seem to have a maf only map. 
129 code is the only code it displays.


I replaced the map sensor with a new OEM sensor and still getting the code. Truck drives alright but doesn't really pull at all when driving and struggles to break 40mph. It also has very minor surging at idle


I tested a bit for vacuum leaks with propane, no surges. Getting around 20inhg of vacuum at the map sensor. Unplugging the map sensor does slightly alter the running condition 

truck has fresh air, oil, fuel filters and new plugs and wires, as well as redone the timing with a light. 

Any advice on how I can get it running right would be much appreciated, not sure where to look next.  Thanks!

  you can do voltage drop tests from the ring terminals on these to the negative battery with the engine running and the headlights on  to the various ring terminals bolted to the body.. 

 another thing to check is circuit 359..  it is a Grey with red stripe wire that is on most of the sensors.. it is the ground side for the sensors and it connects to PCM pin 91.. inside the computer is it connected to the circuit board comes out to 5 different possible pins to the harness and Ground location G101

The check engine light came on along with the slip indicator. I checked online, and we replaced the gas cap. This did not fix the issue. Later on, the car started to stutter and slip infrequently. When coming to a stop, it would slip into neutral and not accelerate. The car would physically bump/jolt when fully stopped. Shifting from drive to park, then re-engaging the drive, seemed to fix it whenever it happened. Soon, however, that stopped working as effectively as well. I got an engine tool thing and the code was P0705, so I took it to the mechanic, and they did a transmission fluid change (not a flush). This did not fix the issue either. I took it to another place they recommended. They replaced the PRNDL range sensor and ultimately replaced the shift lever. I am here now because none of these solutions have worked.

1ng810f,Chrysler Warranty (lifetime wrap),"In 2008 when the industry was down, I bought a new 08 Ram 1500 (5.7L).   

Because they couldn't sell a car/truck to save their lives, they offered a lifetime added care plus wrap for $1750.  It essentially made it to where I had a bumper to bumper warranty for ever.  The finance guy even entered mileage into the computer for me to see.  From: 127 miles Until: 999,999 miles.  

I've been the envy of a lot of family and friends.  Reae different blew out, A/C busted, Alternator, window motors, and more.  Always covered, no matter the mileage.  Completely free sans my $100 deductible.  

Now I've developed a death wobble.  Bought new rubber and got an alignment.  Still wobbly.  I crawled under it and noticed my lower ball joints were toast..as were my control arm bushings, struts, and stabilizer links.  My A/C started blowing hot again.  No worries though, EVERY SINGLE THING wrong is covered despite the fact that I have 222,500 miles.  

The Dodge house has my truck for 2 weeks, then yesterday they called and said they were cancelling my warranty and cutting me a check for $2300.  Reason: the cost to fix ($10,000) is more than the valuation of my truck.  

I'm boiling mad..  Dodge is trying to save $ at the cost of putting me and my family back in an unsafe vehicle.  

Service guy said that clause was in my warranty fine print that I signed.  I'm looking for the contract, but all I can find is the wrap brochure.  On it, it has; When does my warranty start and stop.  Under which it's states from the sale date until the end of my life, or until I sell the truck.  

I'm desperate... Can anyone help me?  There is an appeal process that I'm about to start.  

I've spent tons at the service department in order to keep my warranty good.. (""well, you need to go ahead and do a coolant swap, rear diff oil swap, transmission fluid swap, brake fluid swap or they could deny you for neglect""). They told me this constantly and I always did it out of fear.  Fear that was wasted because they have now left me high and dry.

He just went in for something this year and got the same exact spiel. The lifetime warranty means nothing once the value of your car is so low that a $1000 repair equates to a “total loss”. You can appeal but the chances of them fixing something as expensive as this is slim IMO. My dad kept all his paperwork and sure enough found it. He did the appeal too. They dragged it along and just denied it with the “per contract” verbiage. It’s still a good run though. Almost 20 years of bumper to bumper coverage. You’re lucky this is the first road bump you hit. About 3-4 years ago, my dad ran into an issue where none of the Chrysler service centers would accept his car anymore for repairs. They gave him the “we don’t have any technicians trained or capable of working on a model this old” which is bs. But ended up to where (after a lot of fighting) the only place that agreed was a shop in the inland empire (Southern California) that was over an hour away. Even then, though, they (in my opinion) kept his car for a ridiculous amount of time, for like 6 weeks, to fix an AC issue. They claimed it was because the parts are impossible to find. But I think they were sending a message that they’ll make it not worth your time if you try bringing in another repair.

It does make sense though. What happens if the car ever became non-repairable? They’d have to pay out the value of the car. Which is essentially what they’re doing. I agree it sucks.. but it does make sense. Realistically, the company isn’t going to pay $20,000 in repairs for a $2,000 car. 

One suggestion is to get AS MUCH for your truck as possible. Look up comps online and push for as much as you can. They want to end this ordeal too so they may add a few extra hundred to make you go away.

CurrentlyatBDC (Score: 1): This is unfortunately one of the key terms/limitations of the lifetime warranty, they can buy you out when the time comes.

Chain rides on top of the sprockets on both the rear head (pictured) and the front head. The timing of the cams is retarded.

It throws an occasional error code for crankshaft position sensor when I connect the piggyback ECU which advances ignition timing through advancing the crankshaft position sensor reading. It didn't do that before. The piggyback has the ability to advance timing up to 5 deg. I think the advance of the crank position sensor and the chain stretch creates a big enough mismatch between the crank position sensor and the cam position sensor. If I disconnect the piggyback the error doesn't show up.

LWschool (Score: 1): I’m a little confused. Why is the timing chain retarded? 

It looks like a normal tensioning thing to me - the valve cover has a chain guide that pushes it down to tension it properly. 

That could be worn out, there’s sometimes an auto and sometimes a manual chain tensioner you can also inspect. 

What kind of piggyback ECU are you using? The basic ones simply modify existing engine signals, and yes, you can push it to where the ECU notices and it’s not happy. That’s what an ECU flash would fix, a proper pro-tune."

A few months ago I kept getting a low oil sign on my van (2020 vivaro), I took it to a mechanic in my town and he was the only one able to work on long wheel base vehicles. Good reviews mostly and seems a genuine chap 

He told me my turbo was done and needed replacing which was fine, van has just hit 96,000 miles so sounds about right 

A week later my AC stops working. I completely understand this is unrelated and I paid him to re gas it and he did. Found a leak, paid for him to fix it and he did, all good, for now

A week after this my oil light came back on. He filled it two weeks ago (at this point) and changed the filter etc. I rang him saying it doesn't seem right, I've only done 800 miles, he told me to bring it in which I did and then he told me that my rocker cover was broken. I agreed to the works and paid duly as to be honest I don't know a huge amount about mechanical work (I'm a heating engineer)

Here's the issue. Nearly 6 weeks has past since all these works and a few days ago I was driving home after a days work and smoke was coming from the engine, I arrived home to find oil on top of the rocker cover and other parts of the engine (assuming a leak) I sent a video (which I'll post below)

I took it in yesterday night and he looked at it today and this evening he has text me this:

Is this guy having me over. Is he trying to mug me off?

I got an oil leak diagnosed at a mechanic last week and was told the oil pressure sensor was leaking. 

Its my understanding they will leak around where the rubber meets the metal as they are glued in that spot.

Took it out. Looked at it. Looks like its leaking there makes total sense i dont see glue there like there is on the new one. 

Thing is, you can tell from the threads that this sensor was absolutely NOT all the way set. It also clearly has sealant on the base.
Less than half the threads were clean on removal. Looks like the rest were exposed.

They both have a tapered base and when i went to install the new one it was clear that i was def a bit over 13 ft/lbs and it was not going to seat flush without really cranking it.

About half the threads on the new one are in after going back and forth a bit and applying some red loctite after removing the new one and cleaning it before final loctited install.

Should i have forced it to fully seat? Would that risk cracking the housing? 

I will wait an hour before firing it up and seeing if all is well.

Any advice is appreciated.

TLDR: engine will only start the first time, it won't start the second time right after stopping it (seems like it wants to take off with only 2 out of 3 cylinders). It will only start again if i wait 30-60s. Every time. Don't have a clue why, there are no errors (diagnostics).

Short history:
- Car ran normal but had a very loose timing chain (rattle).
- After the timing chains were replaced, car started and ran for about 10s then it would not start again. Conclusion: fuel injectors were stuck
- Got them cleaned and unstuck. Then, after a few start attempts the engine started, all good. To make sure it will start again, we tried stoping it and starting it right after. It won't start. Everything is spinning and looks like we have some detonations (whole car shakes) but won't start. Out of trial and error we observed that the car will always start of you give it 1-2 minutes between attempts. Does not matter if the engie is warm or cold. There are no errors on ODB/warning lights.
- After a longer ride (1h) i noticed the power is not there like it used to be, missing about 30% of it from what i can tell.

EDIT: if you disconnect the battery power right after shutting down the engine and connect it back, it starts without wating 1 minute.

The car was rallied hard, this is facts.. some of the things on the list make me question the diagnostic honesty here.. I would get a 2nd/3rd opinion and I'll elaborate.

 If the coil spring Is broken, surely the shock is bent or leaking at least. But I see no mention of this.

In a peofessinal auto repair environment, you don't diagnose wheel bearings by noise. You check the wheel end play, at least with a pry bar with the tire off the ground and this is rudimentary. Usually you check the play with a very accurate have that reads to the thousands of an inch, because some play is tolerable. Some is not, it's your job as a professional to assess repairs that are needed and repairs that aren't. Noise is not something you can confidently use as a reason. Also with all the broken parts on the suspension, how would one know what he's actually hearing.

I see nothing of an alignment which would be needed.

Usually a check list is done, and each section is explained to be good or bad in different ways.

As for the timing belt components, if there isn't a service record, or a under hood label at least of when it's been changed last it's impossible for the tech to know the belt is ""aged"" and has high mileage. Now if he said the belt is tearing or the teeth are worn, I could go for that. I do not understand his logic of this diagnosis. Also he did not recommend a water pump, etc etc which is part of the timing components. If you do a timing belt, you do it ALL. That's why it comes in a kit and timing is a somewhat major repair. If your a rookie you can destroy the engine or do shoddy work. It's a lot of work and you don't really know much till it's all back together and fires up. You don't slip over little parts like water pumps and tensioners just to come back and do it 10k miles later cause you wanted to save $50.

3. Could this code also be related to the **oxygen sensors** or anything in that system?
4. Can I safely do a **DPF regen**? If the DPF was cracked, could regen cause fire? Could it damage injectors/turbo? Or is it better to just try before limp mode?
5. Can I trust this live data to confirm the DPF isn’t actually clogged?

I’m in Africa with no skilled mechanics, so I need clear steps before this turns into another 6-month headache again.

First thing is possibly a tire out of balance, if a wheel wight came off.  You can try rotating the tires from front to back and see if the vibration changes.  

Has there been any front end work done on the van?  At 130k miles, original shocks, tie rods, ball joints and control arms will all have a fair bit of wear.  

Go to a parking lot or a cul de sac turnaround and try driving slowly in the smallest possible circles, put the windows down and listen for clicking or popping sounds. These noises are usually signs of worn CV joints on the axles, which might cause this, although it is not the most likely reason."

I had to limp it about 1.5 miles going 3 mph (fastest it would go). It has been broke down for three weeks because every time I crank it, it still says it is running hot and it won’t go over 3-5mph.

One is for fuel pressure. Two are for transmission communications.  P1299 is cylinder head temperature, which is unlikely right away on cold start up.  Instantly getting hot temp readings on a cold engine suggests a wiring problem, or a bad sensor.  My guess is there is a central electrical problem that is creating havoc with the computers, which would also explain why the car goes into limp mode and won't go more than 5mph.

I would start with making sure the battery connections, including where the ground cable attached to the body and engine, are clean and tight.  I assume the battery is healthy, as it will start the car.  

The other thing to check is that compression is good and there's no signs of coolant intrusion like white smoke out the exhaust, or coolant in the oil.  When coolant gets into the oil, it turns a sort of beige creamy color, and you can get a gunky build up on the underside of the oil cap.  The Ford 1.5 Ecoboost engine has design flaws that can lead to coolant intrusion problems.  There are some extended warranties from Ford to cover this, I don't know if they might apply to your car or not."

It is normal for oil pressure to drop a bit at idle, but it should stay high enough to keep the warnings off.  If the oil level is OK, you could try swapping out the pressure sensor, or better yet get a manual gauge and check what the pressure actually is.  It might just be a bad sensor, or it might be an actual oil pressure problem.

If you have the Chrysler ""Pentastar"" 3.6 V6, maybe the oil cooler is leaking.  This might allow oil pressure to drop, and AFAIK it also lets coolant mix with the oil, which might thin out the ""oil"" and lead to low oil pressure."

Clutch and brakes are routine but not very frequent maintenance, starter motor is bad luck.

I guess you have to look over the car and decide if it is worth continuing to fix it, or sell it for whatever you can get as is and move on.  If the repairs cost less than buying a reasonably good used car (including taxes, registration etc), then fixing it makes more sense.  That depends on cost of repairs vs cost of replacement, and what it might sell for."

PATS key programming requires going thru the OBD-II port.  The programming mode you described is for the programming the remote entry buttons on the key or key fob.  

The fast blink indicates the vehicle has not been programmed to accept the key being used.

A Ford Dealer can program this for you using Ford IDS software.  An automotive locksmith can do this as well, might be cheaper, and they usually come to you, saving a towing fee, and they are available on weekends.

You can program keys yourself with FORScan, but it's a steep learning curve.  It requires an OBD-II interface cable, a PC and an extended license for the FORScan software.  You can read more about it at r/FORScan or at https://forscan.org/

Well, it has been an absolute hell of a summer for car issues for me. A week ago, I drove it up to NYC to visit, and the catalytic converter was stolen. I bought a new part and had a local mechanic weld it on.

As I was driving away to head home, the car literally sputters out and stops driving on the Williamsburg bridge. Cannot make this stuff up. I’ll include pictures.

I got a check engine light, then a check hybrid system message, and then it seemed like every light in the dash lit up. I was luckily able to get it to start again, and drove it across the bridge (re-starting it every few minutes) where it finally stopped for good and refused to drive.

A tow truck came and took it to a random shop in Brooklyn, and now I’m stranded here without a way to get home, sort of freaking out as you can imagine.

My question is: has anyone ever dealt with this issue, or does anyone have any insight into this?

There was a blue Z06 Corvette, a Porsche 911 GT3 with a large spoiler, and the real prize a red McLaren P1, Id recognize that side panel anywhere, id seen it so many times as the ""T20"" in GTA V that it recognized it immediately. The particularly weird part is that while we are near a large well known city, we are 30-40 mins *away* from that city out in a far more rural area. In fact all three of these catch of the days where all in this more rural area, not the city that i drive into.

And if its not some modern high end car (I keep wanting to use the  word ""super"" or ""hyper"" but i don't know how they apply) then its some *extremely* beautiful classic car like the 2+2 Fastback i saw last week.

1nfkipa,What should I do with my 2011 Subaru Forester?,"I (college student) have a 2011 Subaru Forester with 159,000 miles on it. I bought it about a year and a half ago and it has given me nothing but stress ever since. I bought it for around $5,500 after totaling my previous ancient car (RIP my beloved PT Cruiser) and only a year after buying it the engine crapped out. It was in the middle of a really important summer internship where I was driving long distances (35-40 minutes one way) almost every day and we didn't have the time or money to buy a new used car so my parents decided to replace the engine. We paid $5000 for a new radiator and a used engine with 50k miles with a 6 month warranty on all the work done on it. It was a rough choice to make, but it happened and now I'm here.

A month or so afterwards my check engine light comes on while driving on 95 with a PO420 code. After some investigation we replaced the oxygen sensors and the light went off. Fast forward to now, a month or so later, and the car intermittently won't start. First it doesn't start, so I jumped it and took it to a battery place to get the battery and starter tested. They couldn't find anything wrong but the car still wouldn't start even with jumping it. The next day I went back and it started fine, but starts making this screechy whirring sound coming from one of the belts. I drove it back to school that day and a few days later took it to another place to get the problem diagnosed. Of course this time the car starts perfectly fine, no whirring or anything. The car place can't duplicate the issue or figure out what's wrong but recommended the front bushings get repaired (which is fair, they're pretty messed up), a battery replacement (though they said it's not an urgent issue), and replacing the belt and tensioner to try and fix the issue. They recommended some other small fixes like fluid replacements (brake fluid, transmission fluid, engine oil, coolant exchange, and front and rear differential fluids all except the engine oil due by mileage), replacing the spark plugs, fixing a minor AC leak, and something about the exhaust (they wrote ""rust flanges not leaking""?) all of which I can't afford to worry about right now. They also said that my tires were dry rotted, which I'm absolutely sure is wrong but the woman also made some questionable comments about avoiding buying Subaru, Honda, or Mazda cars in general so I don't know how much I trust their opinion at this point. I'm driving the car home from college tomorrow so my parents can help fix some of these issues and save some money.

Basically, after fixing those three things, do I sell the car or try to fix the current problem and hope something else doesn't pop up next? I don't trust this car anymore and I'm just tired of losing money to this thing. I would love to just fix it and keep driving it but I can't help but think I'm just gonna always be fixing the next problem and losing money. Keep in mind, I can't afford to get another car unless I can reasonably get more than like $5500 at the very least for this car and that's with taking out a car payment. None of this is ideal but I just don't know what to do anymore. Should I cut my losses or keep trying?

Check power and ground connections. Loose ground connections will keep vehicle from starting/running.

If connections are tight ....

Spark test.... 

Do not spend money all until you run. If engine is bad spending money on anything othrr than a rebuild is flushing money down the toilet.

For spark test first make sure battery is charged or you wont get an accurate test

Wear gloves. Shove a long screw driver in one of the coils and the then put screwdriver really close (but not touching) to something metal such as valve cover if its metal. Have someone turn the key like when trying to start vehicle. You want a blue spark. If not blue there is a spark problem. Repeat test for each coil. If test fails you either have an electrical problem such as a connector or bad coil(s). If spark is bad its your money but I still wouldnt buy  parts until all tests are completed.


Fuel test......

 A few ways to test. Might want to wear rubber gloves and eye protection Find Schrader valve and press it. If fuel sprays out you have good fuel pressure. Or you can use a fuel pressure guage and connect it to Schrader valve and have someone turn key. If pressure goes up fuel pressure is good. Or you can  release pressure from Schrader valve then remove fuel line from throttle body (but have a container to put the hose in for safety and wear gloves and eye protection) then have someone turn key. If fuel sprays into into container your fuel is good. Disconnecting fuel line without a containerbto put fuel line in and letting gas spray on engine is a good way to start a fire.


For compression test you will need a compression test gauge.

Do not run this test unless you have a full battery charge and both fuel and spark (ignition) are disabled by removing proper fueses You dont want a fire or shocked or electrical short caused or excess fuel put into the engine.

Access engine compartment fuse box and pull fuses to disable both fuel and spark. Depending on vehicle you may need tonpull fuel rail.  Then remove ignition coils and spark plugs. Screw in compression tester into one of the spark plug hole ports. Have someone turn engine key for up to 10 revolution. I usually do around 6 revolutions. Record results on gauge. Repeat process for each cylinder (each spark plug hole).

Leak down test.....

You will need an air compressor and leak-down test gauge.

Leave spark plugs out from compression test and fuel and spark (ignition) disabled from compression test. 

 Manually rotate engine to TDC (Top Dead Center) for the cylinder you are testing. This means the piston will be at the highest point (not hoing up any further but not going down either).  You need to test each cylinder individually. Each cylinder you test needs to be at TDC for the cylinder you are testing. You can confirm by shining a flashlight into spark plug hole when turning the crank. Turn engine by inserting a wrench on to crank shaft bolt. If you dont have room to insert a wrench you may have to rotate engine by hand. It can be done but isnt easy.  Easier with two people. One to turn crank and one to look down into cylinder. Can do it yourself though.

Make sure regulator is off on leak test gauge. Screw in leak test gauge to cylinder at TDC. Connect compressor to leak test gauge. Gauge should be at zero. Gauge should still be at zero. There are two gauges Adjust leak test gauge slowly up to 100psi on left gauge. When at 100psi on left gauge look at gauge on right. Record results


When done search online for results of compression test and leak-down tests. If compression and/or leak tests failed then you have an engine problem. Pobably need a rebuild.

If all tests pass then Id starts by doing a tuneup. Spark plugs pcv valve. Possibly coils and air filter too. Might want to use cleaner to spray out Map/Maf and IAC sensors.

In 2024, I got the engine code P0303 (""Cylinder 3 Misfire Detected""). Attached is a photo of the spark plugs from that time.

Today, I got the engine code P0303. The new spark plug looked a lot like the 2024 spark plug, charred in the same way. The other plugs still look good, and all 4 ignition coils look fine. I replaced the plug in cylinder 3 and my car works fine again.

My question: I'm kind of concerned that (1) the spark plug got charred so quickly and (2) my car charred it the same exact way in the same cylinder. Am I overthinking it or is there an underlying issue in cylinder 3 that is serious enough to look into?

(My emergency funds are depleted, so when I say ""serious enough"" I mean needs to be seen by a mechanic immediately vs. can be ignored until I can afford a mechanic to look into it, which might be a month or two)

Car: Toyota RAV4 2010 2.2 D-CAT Diesel,74,000 miles

After an hour of driving I got:
👉 **P2002 – DPF efficiency below threshold (Bank 1)**

Cleared it and the lights went away, but I think it’ll return on a highway run.

The car was not driven in 6 months but differential pressure dpf is very low. Someone said it could be ash buildup and not carbon causing the issue or it could be something else 


📊 **Live data (exact):**

* DPF differential pressure: **1.3 kPa**
* DPF PM block: **No block**
* DPF overtemperature: **Normal**
* DPF no activate: **No activate** → turned to *activate* when driving
* DPF thermal deteriorate: **Normal**

❓ Questions:

1. With pressure this low, what’s the likely cause? Sensor fault, wiring, EGR? Where should I start?
2. Where is the DPF differential pressure sensor located on this model? Could it be unplugged or faulty like my IAT was?
3. Could this code also be related to the **oxygen sensors** or anything in that system?
4. Can I safely do a **DPF regen**? If the DPF was cracked, could regen cause fire? Could it damage injectors/turbo? Or is it better to just try before limp mode?
5. Can I trust this live data to confirm the DPF isn’t actually clogged?

First, when you replace wheel bearings, replace both sides at the same time. Because if one wears out, the other one is usually pretty close as well - and you want even wear on both sides at all times. 

The other possibility is it *could* be a CV joint -although difficult to determine which side just from listening to the video. I call out these two possibilities because of the very specific symptoms of only hearing it at certain speeds and while turning a certain direction.

If I had to choose between the two, I'd go with the front wheel bearing that you didn't replace yet. Hope that helps you narrow it down.

1nft7en,"After 6 months, countless posts on here, I finally fixed the p1497 code","After battling with a **P1497 – Intake Air Temperature Sensor 1 Circuit High** code for **6 months**, I finally solved it yesterday! 🎉

Car: Toyota rav4 2010 d-cat 2.2l diesel 
Mileage: 74,000 miles 

Here’s the short story:

* Everyone (even Toyota) told me it was the **MAF sensor**.
* After digging deeper, I discovered the IAT sensor is actually a **separate sensor** located on the **intercooler pipe** (needed to access it from under the car).
* The “faulty sensor” turned out to be **just unplugged**. Plugged it back in, and the car instantly came back to life. 💪

The car hasn’t been driven in 6 months (long injector saga — sent 1 to test, still had issues, then fitted 4 new ones). Once I finally had it running again, it drove beautifully… for about an hour.

Then — BAM:
⚠️ *Check 4x4 system*
⚠️ *Check engine system*
⚠️ Engine light on.

I thought P1497 returned, but instead I got:

* **P2002 – DPF efficiency below threshold (Bank 1)**
* On the **same diagnostic tool**, it also showed as **P2002 – Particulate trap efficiency below threshold (Bank 1)**

Here’s the strange part:

* With P1497, clearing the code never worked — lights always stayed on.
* With P2002, I cleared it once and the codes disappeared along with the lights. But I’m worried it’ll return after another highway run.

📊 **Live data from OBD:**

* DPF differential pressure: **1.3 kPa** (I read it should be 20–50 kPa, and if blocked it should be much higher)
* DPF PM block: **No block**
* DPF overtemperature: **Normal**
* DPF activate: **No activate** (but changed to *activate* once I started driving)
* DPF thermal deteriorate: **Normal**

So my questions are:

1. With such a **low differential pressure (1.3 kPa)**, what could the real issue be on my car? Could it just be a sensor fault, or something else? **Where should I start checking step by step, and how can I fix it?**
2. Where exactly is the **DPF pressure sensor** located on the RAV4 2.2 D-CAT (2010)? Could it be unplugged or faulty?
3. Is this code sometimes linked to the **EGR system** instead of an actual blocked DPF?
4. Would doing a **forced DPF regen** be safe in my case?

   * Can a regen cause issues if the DPF is cracked?
   * Is there really a risk of **fire** (something I read online)?
   * Can regen damage new injectors or the turbo if something else is wrong?
   * Or is there basically **no harm in just trying a regen** before the car risks going into limp mode (when regen won’t work anymore)?
5. Can I trust my **live data** (showing no block, normal temps) to confirm the DPF isn’t clogged?
6. What **specific parts of the car should I visually inspect** before assuming the DPF itself is bad? (Any clear directions would help, because online diagrams and guides are so conflicting — one says here, another says there.)
7. Could it be due to an oxygen sensor which is not plugged in or faulty?

👉 **Car:** Toyota RAV4 2010 2.2 D-CAT Diesel

I’m stuck in **Africa** with no skilled mechanics or advanced tools, so if this turns into a proper DPF block, I’m in real trouble. That’s why I need to know if this is just a **sensor/connection issue** or something more serious — before the code becomes permanent like my last one.

Any advice, experiences, or even pointing me to the **exact sensor location**  that are relevant for this code would massively help. 🙏

I thought it did at one point and slipped out but now it doesn't go in at all so I may have hallucinated that. We are trying to work through the possible problems in order of easiest/cheapest up to ""not a chance that I can do it myself/takes thousands of dollars"".

Some details:  
\* The Tahoe had a code for the mass airflow sensor. We replaced the air filter and cleaned the sensor really good. The code went away for a couple days but now the check engine light comes on intermittently. Unfortunately it's never on when we get anywhere that can check it, so not sure if it's the same or different now.  
\* The transmission oil cooler line had popped off because it needed a new black ring connector thing and a new piece that screws into the radiator side. (Sorry, I am not good with remembering the specific names of things.) We got it fixed and there's no problem with that anymore. Not even a teeny drip.  
\* We've changed the transmission filter and completely refilled with brand new fluid. No leaks.  
\* When changing the transmission filter the fluid was quite dirty but nothing that looked like coffee grounds or sludge, no metallic flakes, nothing like that. BUT there were PEBBLES in the pan. I rinsed them off and checked them over and over. Legit ROCKS. Figure that's not good, but it wasn't clutch material.

We were going to try changing the solenoids (which is a whole different question... like, which solenoids? I've heard there's shift A and shift B and an EPC that could be causing the problems? But no one at the auto parts store knows what I'm talking about and they have no idea what I need either. Anyway.... moving on...) but then someone said we should instead try checking and cleaning the transmission harness and main connector. We're having a hard time finding out exactly where it is though. The person who suggested that I do this said it's on the outside of the transmission pan but then someone else said you do have to remove the pan. I'm just confused.

1ng6omz,Need First Car Advice,"CONTEXT: I am NOT a car guy, do not find looking at cars entertaining. I’m a fresh college grad that got my license 1 month ago. I plan to drive my car to and from the gym, train station, and grocery store. I am trying to get a cheap, fuel-efficient car (gas not electric) so that I can move around in the car-centric suburbs. I will be LEASING because I know that I will be moving into a major metropolis in two years (LA, SF, NYC, etc). I also live in the North East and though we have seen less snow than prior years, turbulent weather (flooding goes insane) and hilly terrain requires a car with really strong steering and torque (idk what else is important, kinda hoping y’all could help me out). I live with my family and my parents own their own car (a big 7 seater). I’ve been thinking about what sized car I want given that my parents already have a SUV. I am stuck between getting a smaller SUV (like a Subaru Outback) so that I can take weekend road trips (within 200 miles) with (4ish) friends or getting a smaller car (ie honda civic/accord) to not deal with driving such a large car. I will be paying for insurance, monthly payments and all that so really trying not to break the bank.

I’ve done a little bit of preliminary research and these are the most important features that I’ve identified (given my needs/wants above):

NEEDS:

* Good steering (thinking AWD)
* 4 doors
* Fuel efficient (gas is very expensive)
* Easy to maintain (doesn’t constantly break down)
* SAFE (obviously)
* Great on hills/tough weather
* VERY good back up cameras (something that works in rain too)
* Minimize cost while ALL needs are met

WANTS:

* Decent speakers for playing music (functional bluetooth is huge plus)
* I’m pretty tall (6ft) so driver leg room is helpful (nothing too compact)
* Strong air conditioning
* Decent sized cup holders (not too important)
* Trunk space i guess for trips but I’m not sure how many I’ll be taking

Given all my wants/needs, what car do you think I should get (company and model)? Also, is there anything I’m looking over or advice that y’all can give?

P.S:

* Have you bought one of these cars and had a bad experience?
* Should I avoid any of these brands?
* Should I avoid PHEVs for any reason? I know they have higher maintenance costs and may depreciate faster than other cars.
* Should I be worried about not finding someone to repair these cars?

1ng2au7,Front wheel brake disc overheating,"Hello,

  
I have a Toyota Yaris with 45k miles. A noise was coming from the front right wheel so I took it to a mechanic who suggested replacing the disc and pads since they were rusty and needed replacement.

After replacing the disc and pads, the wheel started overheating significantly, I measured around 120°C with an IR thermometer. I went back to the mechanic who suggested that the caliper might be faulty, so I replaced it with a new one.

However, the issue is still not resolved, the right disc gets much hotter than the left. I lifted the car on a stand and I noticed that the right wheel does not spin freely, whereas the left one does.

Any idea what the issue might be, and why the brake is not releasing the disc.

* Spin the right front wheel that drags.

* Crack the brake bleeder open on that new caliper.  Does the resistance lessen? (If not, the issue is in the caliper/bracket/slides)
* If so, tighten the bleeder and pump the brake pedal a few times.
* Spin the wheel to verify it still drags & feel the resistance
* Crack the top of the flexible brake line (where it meets the hard line in the car).

1ng096v,2006 Mazda 3 manual transmission shaking at highway speeds,"**Big block of text, TL;DR at the end to sum it up.**

Hey everyone, hopefully someone here has the answer because I'm about stumped. As the title says, I have a Mazda 3 that is shaking at highway speeds (becomes noticeable at ~55 mph, increases from there.) This only started after I did some recent work to prepare for a trip this winter, swapping out the suspension assemblies on the front and the struts on the back. The shake completely dies off if I'm making a left hand turn, which led to me thinking it might be a wheel bearing. I'm not getting any sort of sound that would indicate that, but I did a shake and ear sound test on the front end and didn't find anything wrong with the bearings like that. The only other clue I have to go off of is a sort of roaring louder than expected when doing heavy acceleration. This isn't consistent with speed, just how hard I put my foot down, and doesn't seem to happen at all if I hit the shifting just right. Besides the suspension work I did, I have also swapped the CV axles on both sides, the right lower control arm, both sway bar links, and the rear upper control arms. I've had it all aligned and the noise and shake has maintained itself after doing all of that. I haven't been able to find whatever the issue is obviously myself and the shop I had been using for diagnostic work has pissed me off with failing to find whatever it is and trying to hand me my car back without aligning it (they didn't check if I had swapped the rear control arms for adjustable ones and the office guys didn't pass that on.) 

**ETA:** Full info as the automod requests, 2006 Mazda 3, manual transmission, ~140k miles, believe it is the 2.3L 4 cylinder.

**TL;DR: Bad shake at 55+mph, roaring when accelerating if not shifting perfectly, turning left stops the shake, wheel bearings seem fine, already changed CV axles, lower right control arm, front and back suspension struts, sway bar links, and rear upper control arms, everything is aligned.**

Since then the car has occasionally decided not to start up at all. We need a jumpstart to get it going again. We've called AAA twice and they check the battery/system each time and tell us its all working perfectly. 

We brought it to hyundai again, they could find nothing wrong with the car. They've charged us for multiple cleanings....most recently an intake cleaning.

So my truck recently developed a misfire that’s definitely more noticeable at lower rpm’s. First of all, the truck randomly wouldn’t start one day even though I literally started it a few hours earlier. So I thought flooding, because it would start with throttle wide open and would die right after I let off. So I went thru the carb, checked float levels, replaced needle and seat, and it ran but would die again. So finally I decided to just replace a bunch of ignition stuff, cap, rotor, coil, plugs, and module (wires are newer that I previously replaced). 

So now it’s running and driving, but I’m noticing a lack of power and it’s still misfiring.
Plugs are telling me mixture is fine (I tuned with vacuum gauge, should be close).
It’s worth mentioning though that it’s not hesitating or anything like that, just misfiring at both idle and accel. I’ve already spent a lot on this issue, and am thinking about just getting a new distributor (since I didn’t replace that nor the pickup coil), but I’d hate to pull the old and pop in the new, set timing, and then still have the issue.

Tow it home replace starter and crank right up but almost sounded kind of like the old starter. Fast forward to today car drove 50 miles battery light didnt turn on, stopped at a red light car died. Tried turning on very slow crank then eventually kind of like a buzzing sound. 

Now, no crank, or click from starter.

Also, when you remote start doors lock, so I used key fob to unlock doors and headlights did NOT turn on only Amber's flashed. 

After about 10 minutes head lights turned on and electronics are good, tried jumping car, nothing.

Put a film of PAG oil on my low loss QD fittings, pulled under 500 micron eventually, 5 minute decay to 1500 micron (it's a shitty gauge set that decays when hooked to itself alone) pulled below 500 again for 5 minutes and called it good (super sloppy I know) as it's been on a decent vac pump for an hour basically.

System has failed/no low pressure switch.
Precharged with what it would take from the can. Closed valves to start vehicle, liquid went up to 70psi, suction went into vac, opened valves and charged more.

Pressures are off, way undercharged gets 20/120

Requirements:

- 3 rows (ideally bench second row)
- 4WD/AWD 
- class 5 hitch for a bike rack.

I have a 2002 Lexus es300. Recently its alternator went out (a few months ago) so I ordered a new one and replaced it. We also replaced the belt. It has been working perfectly up until this point. 

The battery is pretty old and went out recently also, so we went to the store today and grabbed a new one. I double checked and it is the exact same. We installed it, the car started up, and now the alternator is smoking. 

It runs fine and there are no new sounds, but the smoke is billowing directly from inside the alternator. It smells awful and I cannot figure out what’s causing it. The alternator is brand new and did not do this before with the old battery.

1nfju3n,Question for qualified Subaru Technicians,"*for people who are either Subaru dealership technicians, or independents that have a lot of experience with the brand*

Hey there! Former Honda dealership technician here! I am wondering what the biggest issues are seen with the 2020 WRX.

For explanation, I have owned 2 Subarus in the past:

A 2013 WRX STI that had the bottom end complete blow up after a 3 weeks of ownership, bent the valves, pistons were in pieces, and holes in the block. I had to rebuild a second junkyard engine for it (It had cracked ringlands) and swap it in. It was frustrating even though I saved on labour by doing it myself. After that the car was sold. 

Then a few years later I got a beautiful 2019 BRZ Sport tech RS that got rear ended at a stop sign and destroyed the car. It had less than 15,000 kms on it. 

I am looking at purchasing a 2020 WRX! The car has everything I like. Manual, turbo, AWD for winter months, and enough horsepower to have fun but justify driving everyday. 

What are some of the biggest issues you guys are seeing? I love Subaru for what type of car they make, but you could see with my past ownership history why I don’t have much of a good gauge of reliability. Are you seeing catastrophic failures in engine, drivetrain transmission? Or any extremely long laborious repairs? Were improvement made by the time this gen got to 2020? Help would be appreciated.

1ngbxds,Salary sacrifice vs buying outright,"I made a post earlier about getting a vw id3 match pure for £350 per month via salary sacrifice for 2 years, 8k miles per year and I thought I’d provide more detail this time round for better context. So the £350 is inclusive of everything like insurance, service and the car with not upfront payment. I do not have a home charger but I live in London and have and public charger across the road at 48p kWh. I’m currently living with family so don’t have to pay rent or anything like that. The argument for buying my own car would be id have an asset at the end of it but me personally would rather spend around 8k on a car that ik would be more reliable than a banger. In terms of insurance if i were to go private I’m looking at around 2.5k for the year so that’s what’s tipping me in favour of the EV car. This is also a more want part on my end but I’ve always wanted to get an EV car instead of ICE just because I like them along with the fact I do want to try and be more environmentally conscious as well. In terms of driving it’ll most be city driving so I reckon about 70 miles per week at the absolute max 

I suppose a TLDR:
Ev salary sacrifice 
Pros - no upfront cost, £350 pm good price inclusive of everything, brand new car. Suits my wants as well

Cons - no at home charging and no asset at the end

 ICE:
Pros - asset at the end, convenience of filling petrol 

Cons - high upfront cost, more paying for maintained as isn’t covered and not a brand new car

There are temporary repairs which can last the life of the tyre, but aren't the proper repair method. The stop and go repair kit is good and relatively reliable though.

Other things need to be considered. Is the puncture within the central 3/4s of the tread width? If it's too close to the sidewall then it can't be repaired as it's more likely to fail.

It would be different if there were fees, low/no interest, etc. Every agreement is different. 

If there's no interest (though that's pretty rare now), you might as well put excess money in a savings account, as there's no real benefit to paying it off early. If it was a 20% APR loan I'd pay that off as fast as humanly possible! That's only a good rate on a credit card!

Only exceptions might be if there's some sort of additional agreement tied to the loan (service agreements, etc) that you'd lose if you paid it off.

If they're paying for dealer servicing to get that extra length of warranty, then they're definetly looking after the rest of the car too. It also works to your benefit to have it currently being covered.

Bare minimum, you'd definetly want to see some proof of hybrid health checks.

**Other special mentions:**

Check the water pump after the test drive. It's on the front of the engine and uses pink fluid, so it'd be a pretty easy thing to spot. It has been known to be a bit of a weaker point (at least earlier in the model's history)

Brakes - Make sure they're operating as you'd expect. The calliper slide pins, for whatever reason, aren't service items, which means they're not getting lubricated and thus can seize if not cared for. Lexus will cover the replacement under warranty if that happens though.

Ensure you're happy with the infotainment. Lexus, in this era, was much more focused on reliable, working tech than fancy new features. It's Lexus' own system with their Navigation, no car play, no android auto.

Ensure you're happy with how the eCVT functions. It's an absolutely bulletproof gearbox, easily the most reliable in any car today. But on a practical level, it functions in much the same way a CVT does, meaning engine RPMs are load-based rather than speed. Some people don't like that.

**Points I'd advise any new owner be aware of:**

Keep an eye on the 12V battery voltage (can be done in-car by pressing and holding the menu button and turning the parking lights on and off several times whilst in accessory/ignition mode). In Toyota's hybrid system, the 12V is only used for accessory power and starting the hybrid system. It doesn't see a significant draw, so if it starts throwing issues, that battery is already at death's door.

Only use Eco mode to cruise. It really isn't great for busier urban roads, it's too sluggish of a responce to cope with such conditions.

The IS has rather soft bushes on the lower control arms. As a result, the front tyres generally wear more on the inner side (I've heard some say the rears as well, but I'm not seeing that personally). Thus I'd strongly suggest that you check the inner treads when checking the tread depth of the tyres. You can upgrade to stiffer bushes from the RC-F/GS-F if you want to keep the parts genuine which will reduce the issue, but you'd likely be looking at PU bushes to actually stop it completely.

The F Sport has staggered tyres

Hoping for some genuine advice. I've just had to reject a car purchase and frankly, I'm feeling a bit burnt by the whole experience. (A LR Discovery Sport for those that will ask) 

I don't want to end up in the same situation again.

I have a budget of around £20k and I'm looking for my next daily driver. My needs are quite specific:

Usage: I have a long commute, driving 150 miles each way twice a week (300 miles total), mostly on motorways and A-roads, but smaller drives will happen around this.

Must-Haves: Because of the long drives, comfort and reliability are my absolute top priorities.

Preferences: I'd strongly prefer a large SUV for the driving position and comfort as I am very tall, but I'm definitely open to a suitable large estate if it meets my needs and I know this place hates on SUV's so I will definitely consider it.

The ""Nice-to-Have"": I know I might be asking a lot for the price, but if it could also be fun or engaging to drive, that would be a huge bonus.

I'm looking for recommendations on specific makes and models (and any particular engines/trims to look for or avoid) that fit this brief.
What would you trust your money on?

Thanks in advance for any suggestions you can offer.

France : perfect lane discipline. Butter smooth roads and very sensible speed limits. Aires every 10-15km which makes taking breaks very easy if you need a toilet break or stretch. 

Switzerland : probably the cleanest place I’ve ever seen. Coming into central Switzerland my mouth dropped at the sight of the Alps. Pictures don’t do it justice. Drivers have very good road manners and aren’t aggressive if have a slower driver in front. 

Germany : Possibly the most enjoyable roads to drive and very eye opening. They think nothing of doing 120mph+ in the rain or diving for an exit at 100+ everything is just very efficient. Even in traffic they create a corridor for emergency services to come through. Then when congestion is over they’re back up to 120+. Seeing a Lotus Emera enter a de restriction zone was eye opening 🚗 💨 !!

Belgium : it seems this is where UK Uber drivers go to learn. Entering the motorway and will jump straight to the far lane. A bicycle sized gap…yeah I can squeeze my car in there without indicating. My exits coming up…I turn now good luck everybody else. Don’t get me started on the traffic around Brussels and the entire E40 route. 

Holland/Netherlands : low speed limits and smooth roads but again no real aggressive drivers and decent lane discipline. 

UK : Potholes galore. Then seeing people who have just driven in France and keep right unless overtaking, then jump on the M20 and sit in lane 2 at 65mph. It’s definitely a choice!

1nfz54h,"Car battery hold-down type, significance.","Hi guys, so as title says, this is about battery. Mine is a vauxhall insignia. Not sure when the previous owner changed the battery but, I had car for 3 years. Had some issue an year ago, but recently it started to go flat. So, decided to change the battery.

I've tried myself on how to unscrew the battery. I was able to unscrew all but didn't actually removed the battery as I didnt have any spare battery. Although I could use registration number of car to see online which is compatible, I wanted remove that see the exact specifications. 

So, I unscrewed but didnt actually lifted it up, the battery was yuasa YBX3075 which has hold-down type b13/b14. I was able to see one on euro car parts, which is of same as YBX 3075, but with B3/B4 type hold-down.


Tried searching online, but couldn't find any info on this anywhere. Tried asking AI to generate image with mark-up of notches to understand, but the mark-up images weren't good enough for me to understand this confidently. 


What I'm looking here is, can I use a B3/B4 hold-down type battery to a B13/B14 hold-down type. If yes, and precautions or things I need to be looking for. If you could also put any images which explicitly contains the notches. (As I didnt remove the battery from the casing, couldn't see the bottom notches, or else wouldn't have to be posting this)

I am able to live with something very impractical as a daily driver so have been looking into 6 and 8 cylinder 2-seat sports cars.

Car: Toyota rav4 2010 d-cat 2.2l diesel 
Mileage: 74,000 miles 

Here’s the short story:

* Everyone (even Toyota) told me it was the **MAF sensor**.
* After digging deeper, I discovered the IAT sensor is actually a **separate sensor** located on the **intercooler pipe** (needed to access it from under the car).
* The “faulty sensor” turned out to be **just unplugged**. Plugged it back in, and the car instantly came back to life. 💪

The car hasn’t been driven in 6 months (long injector saga — sent 1 to test, still had issues, then fitted 4 new ones). Once I finally had it running again, it drove beautifully… for about an hour.

Then — BAM:
⚠️ *Check 4x4 system*
⚠️ *Check engine system*
⚠️ Engine light on.

I thought P1497 returned, but instead I got:

* **P2002 – DPF efficiency below threshold (Bank 1)**
* On the **same diagnostic tool**, it also showed as **P2002 – Particulate trap efficiency below threshold (Bank 1)**

Here’s the strange part:

* With P1497, clearing the code never worked — lights always stayed on.
* With P2002, I cleared it once and the codes disappeared along with the lights. But I’m worried it’ll return after another highway run.

📊 **Live data from OBD:**

* DPF differential pressure: **1.3 kPa** (I read it should be 20–50 kPa, and if blocked it should be much higher)
* DPF PM block: **No block**
* DPF overtemperature: **Normal**
* DPF activate: **No activate** (but changed to *activate* once I started driving)
* DPF thermal deteriorate: **Normal**

So my questions are:

1. With such a **low differential pressure (1.3 kPa)**, what could the real issue be on my car? Could it just be a sensor fault, or something else? **Where should I start checking step by step, and how can I fix it?**
2. Where exactly is the **DPF pressure sensor** located on the RAV4 2.2 D-CAT (2010)? Could it be unplugged or faulty?
3. Is this code sometimes linked to the **EGR system** instead of an actual blocked DPF?
4. Would doing a **forced DPF regen** be safe in my case?

   * Can a regen cause issues if the DPF is cracked?
   * Is there really a risk of **fire** (something I read online)?
   * Can regen damage new injectors or the turbo if something else is wrong?
   * Or is there basically **no harm in just trying a regen** before the car risks going into limp mode (when regen won’t work anymore)?
5. Can I trust my **live data** (showing no block, normal temps) to confirm the DPF isn’t clogged?
6. What **specific parts of the car should I visually inspect** before assuming the DPF itself is bad? (Any clear directions would help, because online diagrams and guides are so conflicting — one says here, another says there.)
7. Could it be due to an oxygen sensor which is not plugged in or faulty?

👉 **Car:** Toyota RAV4 2010 2.2 D-CAT Diesel

I’m stuck in **Africa** with no skilled mechanics or advanced tools, so if this turns into a proper DPF block, I’m in real trouble. That’s why I need to know if this is just a **sensor/connection issue** or something more serious — before the code becomes permanent like my last one.

Any advice, experiences, or even pointing me to the **exact sensor location**  that are relevant for this code would massively help. 🙏

I'm in the process of buying a first car with my partner and we've done a fair bit of research and landed in a Kia Ceed. What with the 7-year warranty, and a decent Which? review, it seems like a solid car for our needs. 

We've found a car we like the look of, 22-plate, 35k miles or so and only one owner, 1.0 litre T-GDI.

The second hand dealership have told me that it received a service in Jan 2025, and another by themselves. I'm worried that this gap in servicing might cause warranty claim issues with Kia down down the line, especially with the warranty being a bit selling point for us. The dealer reckons it's been done, but they have no proof/documentation.

([See this Reddit post as an example](https://www.reddit.com/r/kia/comments/1j6vb2v/kia_wont_honor_my_power_train_warranty_at_61k/)).

Now I know that the USA and UK aren't the same, but nevertheless I would always be very careful to ensure the service history was sufficiently documented when buying a Kia. The long warranty is one of the big selling points of the car, after all.

Ultimately, only Kia UK can answer your question. You'd need to write to them, inform them what service records exist, and get a WRITTEN assurance from them that the manufacturer's warranty is indeed still valid.

That seems like an awful lot of work to go to when there's so many Ceeds out there already. So personally, if I were in your shoes I'd just forget about the one you've seen, and go and find one that has a service book full of stamps instead.

Doubleday5000 (Score: 1): There's not really a answer everyone would agree on.

The sensible choice is the Micra. A cheap car with no problems is a rare beast. You may regret getting into the world of more interesting cars once you factor in fuel, tax, insurance, servicing, maintenance (the faster the car generally the more expensive the tyres for example) etc.

I also started with a sensible choice and then sold it after 9 months. I went for a 2004 Civic Sport. With only 109hp it wasn't fast, but was a rocketship compared to a 59hp city car. I had no regrets. Learned to do work on it myself too. But as above is way more expensive to run, needed more work, was harder to park etc. Luckily I sold it after a year (for a faster version of the same car) because subsequent MOTs show a lot of rust issues! More contemporary choices would be something like a Suzuki Swift Sport. Beginner friendly and pretty sensible, but a lot more fun than a Micra. 

Or you can go a lot more compromised and look at sports cars like Mx-5s, Z4s, MR2s, Boxsters etc. But again the cost and sacrifices go up. Hot hatches are less hard work for a daily, but you may find the insurance cost unaffordable.

Or you really go for it and go for a classic. But that's riskier if you don't know what you're doing and can do work yourself.

Personally I'd avoid leases until you know what kind of car suits you. Your experience so far (just like mine) shows that something can be perfect on paper and not do it for you. You don't really want to be stuck in a lease for a car you don't gel with."
1nfrs3w,A small rant about a 4-hours traffic delay,"Morning all, I just need to vent with someone who might understand my pain.

Yesterday I set off from home (South Wales) to drop off my cousin to Bristol Airport and pick up my wife from Stansted. We left at 12:00 (midday) and being a Friday I though it would have taken us 90 minutes tops to Bristol.

There's massive roadworks around my place, so first traffic jam. Then the M4 was bumper to bumper from Cardiff to past Newport, so down I go through Caerphilly/Newport hills joining the motorway past Carleon (beautiful roads and scenery sure, but bloody hell the traffic). Joining the M4 it was once again bumper to bumper all the way to junction 22, same for the M49 and that tiny stretch of the M5 we drove on. We got there in 2 and a half hours in the end, luckily we left so early that my cousin still had a 2-hours wait in Bristol, so no issues there.

Then it was time to head towards Stansted. Gotten past Bristol (again to avoid massive jams due to works or accidents), then you guessed it, bumper to bumper all the way to junction 4B joining the M25 (including a [15 minutes stop to remove a headlight to replace a blown bulb](https://imgur.com/a/7J3L8bf) because it's a bloody Fiesta). And then, welcome to the M25. I don't think I've managed to reach 50mph until after I joined the M11. I should have gotten there by around 17:00, reaching the destination instead at 18:50, with my wife patiently waiting for me at the free mid-stay car park.

A hug, a kiss, and off we went back home. It was getting so late I was confident we would have gotten home in no time; instead, we were greeted by the M4 being shut in Reading requiring quite a long detour, then another massive jam at junction 23A (Magor) for, you've guessed it, a closure. Once again, we should have gotten home by around 22:30, instead it was past midnight when we finally pulled over.

Had I not had 2 cats waiting for me at home, I would have given up and stopped for the night at a hotel past the M25. I drove multiple times from Southern to Northen Italy and back (16-hours each way), where driving conditions and driving standards are much much worse than here, but goodness me yesterday was one of the worse driving I have ever done.

Thank you all for listening to my rant, and all my sympathy goes to all of you that have to drive long distances every day.

5 days ago, police stopped me on the motorway and speed gunned me doing 92mph as it is 70mph max. I am so scared because i have 3 points already. And i drive a taxi for a living. The taxi council if any driver gets 6 points in one single offence can have their license revoked. Not if you get it in 3’s at a time up until 12 like normal. 

Reason why i sped was because i crapped all over myself during the drive by myself (no customer/passenger), no where to stop or anything i had to keep going and ended crapping myself. When police came over about it i said i didn’t know. That was the first thing that came out of my mouth as i was so embarrassed and shaking genuinely.

I complied, no excuses no begging. Just gave info he needed. 

EITHER WAY I KNOW ITS STILL SPEEDING! No excuses! The officer did say the ticket processing office at the police will decide what action to take. Guessing not court because the threshold for automatic summons/court is 96mph or more. Or perhaps?? 

But what could the potential points and fine be here? If i get 6, i am screwed for dear life, it’s my source of income i should’ve known better. Pays my mortgage, im sole earner, bill payer in the family. I will genuinely be homeless and in horrible debt as i have finances like most do and a mortgage.

I know i should’ve thought about it, but generally im a good driver i don’t tend to speed, but that time i was in pain and an upset stomach and ended crapping myself anyway whilst trying to rush home. Didn’t bother mentioning to the officer because it happened anyway.

1nfkva7,"Mazda, Toyota, Honda petrol 05-10 and Rust","Hi I am looking at cars most people suggest i.e 1.8 avensis, mazda 6 2.0, honda accord 2.0 petrol however when checking MOT history I am seeing a lot of corrosion. My understanding was if you see this you should walk away. For example: Rear Sub-frame corroded but not seriously weakened (5.3.3 (b) (i)) 

I have seen the odd car that doesn't mention any rust in the MOT history, why would this be? Is it due to maintenance etc? Also are there any other car suggestions which are less likely to rust? Budget is upto 2k.  
  
Any help would be appreciated regarding this.

1nfj9c6,Need help convincing a friend,"So a friend of mine is planning to get his first car, a 2019 Audi A1. He really likes the car, but recently found out that it's considered a 'girly' car (whatever that means) and is having second thoughts on going for it. He's been searching for a car for a couple months and hasn't come this close to buying one. I just don't want him to pick something he'll enjoy less because of this weird stereotype. And I was hoping the voices of a crowd would be better than just mine.
Or do you guys and gals also 'believe' in this stereotype",0,1757722445.0,14,CartalkUK,1757878289,2025-09-13 00:14:05,2025-09-14 19:31:29,"yolo_snail (Score: 3): Anything other than an S1 I would consider as a 'girly' car. 

The same way a Fiat 500 or a Mini is a girls car, but an Abarth 500 or Mini Cooper JCW is a man child's car.

If he still won’t but can’t find anything else he likes, convince him to get an S1.
