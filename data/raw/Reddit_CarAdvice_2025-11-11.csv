130k miles (NO MODS)

Symptoms-

Car rough idles severely upon being cranked and it won’t stop no matter what. If I drive it it tends to get a little more aggressive and won’t let up no matter how hard or soft I mash the gas. It struggled to accelerate and when I got it to a decent speed and had to slow down it took forever to pick back up. At least 20 secs to reach 47 mph. At times grey/whiteish smoke will blow from the tail pipe. And it kinda “pops” or “backfire” also. The fuel is also depleting super quickly.

Steps I’ve Taken-

Firstly I had it scanned because the CEL had came on and it was an error Code for Cylinder 1.

I swapped the coil pack around and the misfire still stayed in Cylinder 1, so I instantly thought “spark plug”. I removed the old spark plug and it had oil on it and smelled like gas, I put in the new one and the same thing still was happening. I then took out the new installed spark plug that was only in for about 12 minutes had oil and smelled like gas. That was about 1 month ago. (Video from today) I don’t trust mechanics in my area they’re just “swap it” guys. and I have no warranty any help would be thankful.

That confused me, because I originally suspected a coolant issue. Later, when I went to Jiffy Lube for a regular oil change, they mentioned that I do have a coolant leak — even though I didn’t bring it up to them.

1otp8b5,Smelling stinky emissions. Exhaust system is very rusted. Is it time to replace my entire exhaust?,"Car: 2002 Honda Accord SE 137,000 Miles.



I was replacing my o2 sensors a couple months ago and noticed how damn rusty my entire exhaust system is. I hadn't done underside work on my car before, just brakes and spark plugs and other small easy things. (yes I greased the slide pins)



Replacing my o2 sensors got my check engine light to turn off, and it idles smoother too now, but a couple months later the exhaust smells, and im wondering if it's even worth trying to find a leak and fix it. 

  


Looking at it, I don't think I could get those bolts out with the might of god.



Other info: When I first got the car, the flex pipe had a hole in it, and I had a mechanic weld it. But that was 4 years ago and I knew nothing of cars back then. it cost like $200.

With the current smell, it smells inside the cabin a bit so I assume it's a leak further up closer to the HVAC air intake.

While driving you can't smell it, but standing outside the car you can smell it. It's fairly mild though. But I know that lawnmower-y smell of unprocessed gas exhaust pretty well. 



And no, the car doesn't seem any louder to me so it's probably a small pinhole leak? No check engine light either (yet)



But for an answer on advice I basically just want this:



1: Is this all fine and I should just pay for another weld job wherever the leak is? (I assume I have a leak somewhere)



2: If I was to replace the exhaust, would I be able to re-use my CAT?

The ends look rusted to hell and back though. I live in PA so I could just get a cheap EPA CAT for $120 along with an exhaust kit for like $150.



3: Should I replace the exhaust manifold with a new aftermarket header? Or is mine fine. No problems with it as far as I can tell, other than those bolts rusted away. But the holes should still exist / work with new parts? Would that be compatible with the exhaust kits? 



4: Is this pretty safe and easy for DIY? Exhaust seems like a relatively easy DIY job, since in my car it looks like it's just bolts, O2 sensors, and hangers. I have socket wrenches, drill, and impact driver ready to go. I'll buy a torque wrench if I have to.



If you have any recommendations for compatible kits on rockauto or elsewhere I would happily take those! Or a purchase list since im not aware of everything I need to buy.



My car generally is in very good condition with very little rust other than the exhaust system (came from a southern state). It's paid off and I would love to get another 10 years, and over 200-250K miles. Still runs perfectly, shifts perfectly, has been extremely reliable and never left me stranded. Starts up like a beauty. Having a paid off car in good condition has saved me so much money so I'm happy to invest in her.

I have a 60s era mustang with a c4 transmission. I am looking for tips and tricks as well as identification.
 The car came in pieces and is being put together. 
The unofficial word behind the car is the motor ran and drove, but the transmission was having issues and was pulled. The sheet metal on the car backs this up, as it has been formatted for a 4 speed swap.
I aim to rebuild and install this c4 instead of the manual swap, and I have several questions.
If I buy a rebuild kit, should I go with a master kit vs a soft kit? I didn't want to dissasemble the trans immediately, but the fluid looks dirty; not burned so there isn't much for me to go off there.
The kits are generally formatted for different years of the c4. The tag suggests it might be for a 68' and not original, but the casting number displays that it's a 64.

However generally speaking on these VAG engines P0420 is due to the exhaust flex pipes downstream from the catalytic converters (on the V6) starting to leak. Again generally speaking repairs do not hold up for long so it is always better to have the flex pipes replaced straight away to spend money just once."

Timeline of Events:
Saturday, November 1st: Car starts making weird grinding sound while driving and wheel becomes extremely difficult to handle. Google says power steering fluid issue, looked and the reservoir was completely empty so I added more power steering fluid.

Sunday, November 2nd: Go to get an oil change because they know more about cars than me and I figured they could tell me if there was something wrong. Car is still making weird grinding sound and steering wheel is not working very well. Oil changers tell me that there is a major leak happening and I need to go to mechanic. I decide to go to a PepBoys shop as they are the only ones open. I called around noon and was told to wait until 3:00 to bring in my car because they were short staffed. I give the person on the phone my name and number to hold an appointment for me. I get there at 3:00, ask if they can just look at my car and tell me what’s wrong with it. Wait there for 2 hours, still no word from them. Check in with lady at desk and she said the technician said I could not drive my vehicle and needed to leave it there but that it wasn’t a huge repair and would only take a couple of days. I told them I needed the car back by Friday for the upcoming weekend asked if she could call me when they figure out what’s wrong with it and she said yes.

Monday, November 3rd:
I hear nothing from them all day. I call once I get off work at 4:30, they say that the power steering lines and o rings need to be replaced and it will be a super easy repair, parts are on their way and car will be done end of the day Tuesday. I ask if they will call me with any updates, they say yes.

Tuesday, November 4th:
Once again, hear nothing from them all day. I call once I get off work again at 4:30, lady I talk to says she doesn’t know who I talked to but the parts haven’t even been ordered and she’s going to look for them and place the order right now. She says they will get there in the morning and it will be done end of the day Wednesday. First time I hear the cost, $1,372.

Wednesday, November 5th:
Same thing, no update from them all day. Call them at the end of the workday and ask for an update and they said they got the hoses in and were working on putting them on. Will definitely be done Thursday.

Thursday, November 6th:
Again, no updates. Call them again and they say the technician has been busy and hadn’t been able to finish it up but they were still hoping to have it done by end of day. The person on the phone also said there had been a holdup because they “ordered a bunch of hoses to see what would work”. I said okay, even if I have to wait to pick it up until tomorrow that’s fine.

Friday, November 7th.
I call them in the morning to confirm my car will be done. They say yes and they will call me when it’s ready. I call again in the afternoon because I still hadn’t heard anything and that is when I am told that the technician broke a reservoir when he was replacing the hose and they needed to order that replacement and once it was in it would be an easy swap and my car would be done. I ask if it will be done before end of day because I really needed my car because I was planning to visit my friend. The person on the phone says it’s out of my hands and yours. 

They finally call me later that day and say bad news, replacement reservoir won’t be in until 2:30pm on Saturday. I said okay, and asked if they could make sure to prioritize putting that on as soon as it arrived. That would have given me enough time to drive to see my friend. They said yes.

Saturday, November 8th:

I call them in the morning to ask if 2:30 is still the estimated time of arrival. Manager says yes, he will call me if it changes. I uber to the shop at 2:30 and go in to speak to the guy at counter. He says they were still waiting on that part and he would call right then to see where it was at. He calls the parts delivery people and they tell him that the order got cancelled. I then proceed to wait at the shop for half an hour while he calls various different parts suppliers and can’t find anybody who can get the part in sooner than Monday. Had to cancel my trip to see my friend, not to mention being left stranded without a way to get around town for now 6 days. He said they would see what they could do to get me a discount and that he’d make sure that they got my vehicle done Monday as soon as the replacement reservoir came in. I asked for an itemized receipt and got it, $30 for fluid leak evaluation, $6 for oil dye universal, $47 for power steering flush labor, $9 for power steering fluid, $265 for pressure hose, $354.20 for labor to remove and replace power steering hose, $60 for limited extended labor warranty. Also $134 for power steering reservoir but I was told they would remove that charge. Total is $948.84 after tax.


Monday, November 10th:

Call them at 9:30 to check on vehicle. Nobody answers. Nobody has called me so far.

This has been my most upsetting experience with any sort of mechanic, and I am at a complete loss for what to do. Looking for any advice on what to do if they refuse to give me my car back or if I am being ripped off. Thank you in advance for any help.

1otkric,I need some advice and clarity,"I’m going to try to keep it short. My grandfather passed years ago and he had a 1992C 1500 Chevy Silverado when he passed I inherited it from him and drove it and got an oil change and spark plugs Why are we done on the truck? He didn't do a lot of maintenance on it when he had it. The engine had close to 240,000 miles on it. When I got the oil change and a spark plug change, the oil was midnight black, and the spark plugs were. All eight of them were black. The engine went out on me so did the transmission. So the truck sat in the backyard for at least two years, and I searched around to find a mechanic to help me fix it.

All of the mechanics were going to charge me $10,000 for the engine and transmission brand new however I just wanted the truck running to do side jobs and to make extra money on the side then when I save up enough money, I can just go ahead and buy a brand new crate transmission and engine. I found someone who charged me roughly $5000 for it. I spoke to the mechanic and he received the truck at the beginning of June and had it for at least three weeks He told me that it would be a 20-hour job however it took longer than that and it was a lot of delays. He removed the engine and transmission from the truck however didn’t finish the job. The mechanic was misleading and I thought he had a shop but it wasn’t. It was in his backyard. Note: on Google review, the way, the pictures, and the location were set up. It was a building so the mechanic bought the engine in Transmission however he got the wrong transmission. The one I have is a 700 R4. The one he got was a 4L60E then on top of it the exhaust manifold was different and he didn’t want to take the exhaust manifold out and we had a lot of back-and-forth going on and I ended the job the day that I ended the job he got arrested and is now in prison. I got the truck towed to another mechanic who worked on my car pass.

The mechanic that I have now is very trustworthy and he has had the truck since the end of June. What’s the other mechanic got arrested? I told the truck to him in June and he took a look at it and expected everything and gave me a quote to put the engine and transmission in. However, I had to get my transmission rebuilt. Now it is November he installed the engine and transmission He told me that the driveshaft was broken and he had to replace it and as well as the gas line from the engine to the fuel filter. I am a patient individual however the last time I spoke to him two weeks ago, he said that he was going to call me back last week but he never did. I’m just gonna give him another month by the beginning of December to have my truck fixed if not, then I don’t know what to do  because I don’t want to take it to another McKenna and have to deal with other people's mess

It WAS extremely intermittent, but starting yesterday. I seems like every time I go to start the car, it won't start. Again saying, ""press brake to start"" even when I am pressing the brake. But if you wait 2-3 minutes and try again, it will start, at least with the remote starter.

I know this isn't imperative for the car to operate, but it really does bother the hell out of me.

So, here I am with my trivial problem that I should be capable of figuring out but simply haven't. 

 There is a timer in the center that controls the accessory port, I believe someone rigged it this way for some reason as I can't find any evidence in the manual or online of these having anything there other than an ashtray. I hate this thing. If I'm incorrect and this is an option, does anyone have any idea how to remove or bypass it? Charging phones while driving is a real PITA.

I've never removed sockets before and the most I've ever done with a cigarette lighter was burn straw wrappers out of boredom as a kid while waiting for my grandpa.

Secure-Insurance6540 (Score: 3): Ok great photos. The lapping compound you are using is too course or you may have just lapped it too much! Both the valve and the seat have deep grooves cut into them and that’s why you can’t seal them! 
You have plenty of surface to cool down the valve so you are good there.

My suggestion is;
1. Try using some toothpaste and keep it moist with water to help you get rid of the grooves. Don’t apply too much pressure and be patient. You want a smooth finish much closer to a glass surface. 

If you had to compare the surface to sandpaper grits you want to be closer to 1000 grit compared to what you have which is closer to 200 if this analogy makes more sense.

Also, alcohol is way too thin, test with water or diesel fuel and if it seals you are good to go! 
Remember there is such a thing as too much lapping as your valve gets thinner and the seats become to thick to seal against.
Good luck!"

- Water heater in the block. Installed in a freeze plug. Used to be more or less universal in the past. Heats the block well, but doesen't do much for the rest of the cooling system. 

- Hose heater. Installed in one of the coolant hoses, often has a a built in pump to circulate coolant.

- External block heater. These are a ""new"" development in the last 20-25 years. Very simple to install, just bolts to the outside of the block with thermal paste in between. I've got one on my BMW as that was what was offered. Better than nothing, but not great.

I can also highly recommend you get an electric cabin heater. Usually mounted in the passenger footwell. Modern ones are quite slim and not very noticeable with a good install. Plugs into a normal 220V (110V in the US?) plug.

1ot3t7g,Anxiety about my brakes,"Hi everyone,

A couple months ago I bought a used Corolla 2006. my first ever car. When i first bought the car, i brought it to local a mechanic to get a general inspection and left my car there to go to work. 

15 minutes later he calls me.. Tells me my rotors and pads urgently need to be replaced, and that I would need to pay 700$.

Found it suspicious, so I went to another mechanic to double check. He said he would need to charge me $200 just to check, but he said if the brakes feel fine I don‘t need to worry. He also told me that the first guy probably tried to scam me because the Corolla has drum brakes and not pads.

So I decided to not pay anything and left because the brakes felt fine to me. 

Since then, I‘ve driven 4000 miles in the span of 3 months without experiencing an issue.

However, I now get anxious about my brakes. Every single time I use them. Brought them to multiple mechanics and they just checked the car from the outside without removing anything, one even hopped in the drivers seat and did a brake check, and told me they‘re fine.

But I can‘t help thinking there‘s something wrong with my brakes. I also don‘t want to pay 200$ to have someone inspect them because I‘m broke.

I get really anxious and paranoid about my brakes despite people telling me they‘re okay. I don‘t know how to get rid of that anxiety.

Has anyone ever had a similar problem before? I struggle with this every time I drive.  ",0,1762746746.0,21,CarTalk,1762889722,2025-11-10 03:52:26,2025-11-11 19:35:22,"boganism (Score: 12): $200 to check your brakes,I wouldn’t trust the second mechanic either

1othox0,Should I hand over the Title?,"I have an 08 Ford F150 XLT. It started to died on me one day going through an intersection. Full cut off, instant death. Brought it too a shop they couldn't figure it out a shop next door moved it into their shop after my approval.

They checked it out and saw that it was a timing chain issue. The 5.4 L V8 Tritons are apparently dog shit engines. He wanted 3k for a full timing chain job with a water pump thrown in (because you essentially remove that when you do the timing chain job anyway).

They fixed the issue, went to run it and apparently a few minutes into a run it started screeching? They re examined it and apparently the engine was starved of oil. To fix it now they essentially wanted an extra 1.7k bringing me up to almost 5 thousand to get it running.

I get it IS their fault for not checking the oil however im trying to get this resolved practically.

To be blunt it is a 2008 ford f150 with 180k miles in decent condition. (No rust or chipped paint but very slight dents in bumpers, a broken grill, aftermarket radiator fluid cooler). As far as I can tell even in AMAZING condition the MOST I could net at a private sale is maybe, 6-7k? So id be up MAYBE 2k (IF nothing else goes wrong with it and i sink a few hundred into getting the surface level damages taken care of)

I currently own an 07 impala that runs but isn't great and an 09 fusion that runs.

I haven't paid them a dime yet.

The problem is literal money in the bank. I have about 6k. Total. Thats it. Do it drop the entire 5k leaving me with 1k left and pray to sell it and that nothing else goes wrong? Or do I hand them my title and pay nothing (which is what they suggested). I understand they would profit off such a transaction but to me it just doesn't seem feasible even if it WOULD be fixed and try to sell it to MAYBE be up 2k.

1ot2duo,What is causing my 2017 Subaru Impreza to not start every time?,"Bought my Impreza in November 2024, started having minor issues in March 2025 starting the car. Occasionally the engine wouldn’t turn over, but it started just fine a couple minutes later. In May it happened multiple times so I took it to a mechanic where the check engine light code read P0335, crankshaft position sensor. I had the crankshaft position sensor replaced, continued having problems starting the car after that. I had all four camshaft position sensors replaced in July, still had occasional problems. I got a new battery September after a mechanic said the battery in place was too small and the negative connection was loose. a week after that, I was still having the same problem so they kept my car for a while and ended up replacing the crankshaft position sensor AGAIN. That time they didn’t call me to tell me what they were going to do, otherwise I would’ve asked them to not replace the brand new part I replaced months earlier.
I also had the rear wheel bearings replaced in September, but I can’t really be too mad at that since it had nothing to do with my starting issue and check engine light.
With all of the repairs I’ve had, I have spent over $2,500 and the problem still isn’t solved. In early October, I tried to start my car, and the same exact thing happened. The engine wouldn’t turn over, it just kept cranking. I took it back to the dealership I got it from and they reset the ECU memory to clear the check engine code, and that seemed to mostly work for about a month. The car hesitated but did start a few times after I had this done, but otherwise it was fine. That is, until yesterday, when it was below freezing outside and the car didn’t start. We tried a few times over the span of an hour as well as a day later, and the car still won’t start. I don’t know what the check engine code says now since I can’t start it to bring it somewhere that can read it, but since the same thing keeps happening I can only assume it’s the same code, P0335. 
Other than the starting issue, it seems to drive just fine, but I need this issue resolved. I can’t afford to keep throwing money at this car.

TLDR, Impreza won’t start every time and as of this week it won’t start at all. I’ve replaced the crankshaft position sensor twice, all four camshaft sensors, the battery, and had the check engine codes wiped out of my ECU.

1otsovt,Smoke from vents,"For reference have a 2017 mustang gt in a manual 


I’ve got this weird smoke problem that the auto shop I’ve taken my car into can not replicate. Every once in a while like once or twice a week while I’m driving if I come off the freeway onto a red light or something I’ll get some smoke coming through my ac vents mostly on the passenger side that smells like burning fluids. Sometimes I smell it but there will be no smoke. I want to say it happens when I play with heater or ac controls.

The biggest problem is I can’t replicate it at all or control when it happens. My best theory is something is leaking and it really accumulates when the car is parked when I’m not driving over a couple hours. And then when I drive it whatever has leaked burns off and smokes based on how long it has had to accumulate. When it does smoke it will only happen once when I’m driving and then not again till a separate drive.

Firstly, I'm not a mechanic or a flipper. I enjoy DIY and I've saved two cars from the wreckers because I've become proficient at fixing the 3-5-R waveplate failure in the GM 6T70 transmissions. This is typically on 2009 era Malibus, Saturns and Pontiacs. 

I enjoy it because the vehicle is basically undrivable and a GM dealer would charge $7,000+ for a new transmission - far more than the vehicle is worth. I can take as long as I want (typically 10 hours) and spend $75 in parts and fix the transmission while it's in the vehicle. I don't have a hoist, only jackstands. 

So I'm interested to hear from mechanics of vehicles that you could reliably fix for a solid return once you know the fix. Obviously, if it was easy, everyone would do it, but if there's something that can be done with the right amount of skill and time vs. say replacing the engine or transmission, then I'd love to hear your favorites.

200,000 km

Hey gang appreciate your opinions on this.

A couple days ago I was driving to work on the highway. A quiet squeel started went away and started again over about 30 seconds. Shortly after I got dash warnings (FCW, LDW CEL, maybe others I don't remember). I started pulling over and then the engine was limping/low power. I got onto the shoulder and it stalled. 

I got it started again it was running rough and stalled, checked under hood and smelled hot rubber slightly. All fluids good, oil temp good. I started it again and stalled again then battery died. 

Towed home, thinking bad battery/alternator >7 yrs old on both. Replaced with new battery turned over but never fired. Crank sounded normal, but there was an audible clunk as I tried a few times on one of them.

Towed to dealership for them to diagnose. I had a local shop do timing chain, water pump and drive belt in July and couldn't get it running properly so they took it to dealer who diagnosed oil pump and that fixed the issue. This is why I went to dealership first this time.

Dealership said they pulled valve cover and diagnosed timing 90degrees out and need new engine/rebuild. My wife called to get this info and they told her that silicone was everywhere from a bad repair, but they said nothing about that to me. When I spoke with them they said they suspected an oil port plugged and they saw signs of overheating due to plugged ports. They also said they heard metal on metal when cranking and they needed a booster to crank it because of a dead battery (even though i just put a new one in). Weird that timing jumps and bad alternator/battery at the same time.

I'm suspicious that there's more to the story here, what do you think? Should I get a second opinion? Does this add up? Maybe I'm just being biased and hoping for the issue to be less catastrophic.

Dealer also said they failed to get compression the night before.",1,1762800788.0,3,AskMechanics,1762889722,2025-11-10 18:53:08,2025-11-11 19:35:22,Past_Interaction_360 (Score: 2): Sounds like the timing chain broke.

So if there’s more than 7/32nds on the other three tires yes, you should change all four. They should really match as well. While the system is designed to turn, gears really don’t like to spin at different rates at all times. What seems like 2/32nds is really multiple revolutions per mile, and those build up over hundreds and thousands of miles. Slippage causes heat, this can also cause extra force on the teeth of the gear as one is just a little ahead of the other. Normally on straights everything can just cool down, but if it’s always off it never has that chance. The other issue and the two big reasons they should all match is even traction and ABS. If the weakest tire slips the ABS will try to catch it, but again if this is constant you’re going to wear that spider gear due to continuous strain. The system is designed to take this kind of thing in moderation, and eventually something will give. Normally that’s far outside the life span of a vehicle, but introducing a weak link will add strain that can shorten the life span. I’ve seen neglected differentials go at as little as 60K.

1otabqa,Slight oil on bottom of spark plug – normal for a Mustang Ecoboost?,"Hey guys,

While changing my spark plugs today on my 2015 Mustang Ecoboost (about **56,000 miles / 90,000 km**), I noticed that one of the plugs — cylinder #4 — had a **thin black oily film** on the **bottom part of the plug** (threads and tip). The top and plug well were totally dry.

I don’t think the plugs were ever changed before, and the car runs perfectly fine — no smoke, no misfire, and no noticeable oil consumption. The only thing I’ve noticed is a **fairly loud ticking noise**, which I think might be coming from the **high-pressure fuel pump , and some rough idling that comes and goes at random times (car slightly shaking)**.

My mechanic saw the plug and said it’s an **oil leak**, claiming the **engine needs to be dismounted** to find the source 😬. He also said it’s probably caused by **aggressive driving** and estimated **7 days of labor** for it.

Does that sound legit? Is this something serious, or can a bit of oil on the bottom of the plug be normal on these Ecoboost engines?

1ot5sxr,2013 Honda Accord Sports 4CL Electrical issue?,"hey guys 2013 Honda accord Sports 4cl car owner here; I've been having trouble the past week or so with it starting up. I got a jump and took it to o'rileys after getting jumped where they told me it was the case of a bad battery. I got a new gold edition one to solve the issue about a week ago exactly. Then today i stopped by the gas station to get a snack and when i came back my car wouldn't start. I took the battery to get appraised by the o'riley's dudes and they said i have a good battery still and that it was fully charged.... presumably my alternator is doing its job well. So im stumped but here are some of the symptoms my car is currently showing.   
 It sometimes comes on when i try to start the car (the lights) then when i try to start the car it goes off immediately, then the lights wont light at all? No clicking no sound no start up sound or anything??? I was doing some searching around on the internet and saw maybe i blew a fuse or something or maybe one of my relays is out or something?  
I had to get it towed to my house (Thank God for Triple A) and when i went to get something out of the car all my lights came on in the car when i opened the door!! So i decieded to chance it by putting the key in.  A reassuring car sound came when i put the key in and when i turned the key everything electrical in the car shut off and wouldn't come back on.  
I'm gonna take my battery back to o'rileys and get it switched out in the morning (I'm not convinced it was good) and I'm gonna see it that was the issue...   
I'm willing to hear any advice, Thank you.

1ot379z,What could be causing this brake issue?,"I have a 2013 Ford C-Max SEL

Thursday night when I was driving home I got an alert to check my brake system and the pedal started feeling a little weird (but not spongy), the emergency brake light also stayed on when it was released. At the same time it also started making this whooshing sound when I pushed the brake pedal! The pedal only feels weird and makes the sounds when the car is on, but both happen whether I’m braking during motion or stopped. 

Here is a video of what fast braking sounds like and I will put an Imgur link at the end with a video of what happens when I’m just holding the brake at a stop. The video of holding the brake is a little harder to hear, but it’s that creaky pulsating sound. And there is also a pulsating feeling in the brake pedal that matches the sound. 

I obviously am not driving while there is a risk of my brakes failing, but while I finished getting home that night I tested and didn't find anything wrong with my brakes stopping wise, even doing a sudden fast stop to engage the actual brakes not regenerative braking. There are also no codes showing up and my brake fluid is full. 

I changed my brakes and rotors today to see if that would help and it didn’t fix it. My brake pads were very low so I was hoping it was just a weird glitch from that. (I already had the parts and was doing it this week anyway) My other thought is to do a flush of the brake fluid in case maybe some air got in there somehow? But the things happening don’t really line up with that.

Has anybody heard this sound from brakes before or have any ideas?

1oszlqu,Is this a bad radiator fan?,"I bought a manual 1996 honda civic with 160,000 miles. 

I noticed the coolant level was very low when I got it home and decided to add new coolant. I didn't want to mix coolants and I didn't know what it had already, so I got out the manual and started going through the steps laid out in there for swapping coolant. 

I pulled out the reservoir tube, drained the radiator into a drain pan, then replaced the plug when it was finished draining. 

Then I filled it up with new coolant to the top of the neck. 

I got to the step where I'm supposed to let the car idle until it hits operating temp and top off the coolant, but hit a snag. 

The manual says the fan should come on at least twice, but it never came on. The temperature gauge in the dash hit about the half-way mark that it usually does while the car is running though. I wasn't sure what to do, so I topped off the coolant like the manual says anyway, squeezed the tube running from the engine to the radiator until it was no longer bubbling air, filled up the reservoir to max, put the tube in, and the caps back on. 

Concerned about the radiator fan being broken, I tried to force it to come on by turning on the A/C. The A/C is broken (knocking from the engine bay when I switch on A/C), but I figured maybe the circuit would still force the radiator fan to come on. No dice though, it just sat there. 

I tried checking the resistance of the fan with a multimeter by based on some advice I found online and it registered a reading of 1 - 2 ohms. That seemed to be normal? Not sure.

Tried swapping the relay to see if that would fix it. Waited twenty minutes for the fan to come on. Again, no dice. 

Now I'm not sure if the fan is bad or if I just introduced a bunch of air into the coolant system. I don't see any bubbling or anything while the car is idling. It also never starts to overheat no matter how long I let it idle though, which is strange to me. I drove it an hour home before and it gave me no warning lights and no temp issues on the way.

Maybe I should flush the system with water and try filling again? Idk, I'm lost.

1oszds6,"Block warpage causing coolant leak, new gasket and send it?","Hey everyone, looking for some advice here.

I just got this 1999 Acura Integra LS (no VTEC) with a B18B1. The previous owner sold it for cheap cause the engine ran bad, he said there was a slight rod knock. When I tried it out, it misfired and blew white smoke, so I thought head gasket was done too. I pulled the bottom out of the engine, and the crank is fine, and so are bearings, just slightly marked.

I pulled the head off, and the head gasket was fine, no cracks or anything. The head also measured fine, 0.002 feeler gauge couldn't get under a straight edge. However, the block has this one spot right at the cooling passages around cylinder #2 where a .003 feeler gauge can slide under, but not .004, so it's barely within spec. This cylinder has 10% less compression, way less carbon on the piston, and the spark plug is pearl white, so my guess is that warpage at this spot is causing a coolant leak into the cylinder, and contaminated the oil which led to a slight knock.

From my research, graphite composite head gaskets tend to be more forgiving on clearances since they deform more. Since this is still within spec, should I just slap a composite gasket, replace the rod bearings, and call it day? I am not planning on boosting this engine, so will it handle the stock compression well and last for a while?

Thanks",1,1762733950.0,5,AskMechanics,1762889722,2025-11-10 00:19:10,2025-11-11 19:35:22,"JWBananas (Score: 1): > Since this is still within spec, should I just slap a composite gasket, replace the rod bearings, and call it day?

Hello,

Now it’s worth considering and I must note this. I am competent at home mechanics so running costs isn’t a thought in my mind because I’ll sort any issue myself 

Anyway 

I’m looking at a fun car to go to work and back and generally enjoy daily, I do have a race car so being EXTREME or tuneable isn’t of interest really, it’s nice to know they have the ability but it’ll be tame compared to. 

Here’s my list as it sits 

•Civic type r (ep3 / fn2) generation, I’d also debate a vti eg6/ek4 but I have had a b18 civic before and don’t think I’m getting a different product this time round. 
•mk1 and mk2 Leon cupra Rs 
•clio 182 or 225 megan4
•nice old beamers (e36-90 but absolutely 6cyls) 
•mk5 r32 and gti golfs
•Impreza (again but an old one, I have owned one before but it was a Bugeye I’d be going for a classic shape) 
•1.8t metros and such like 
•turbod up mk1/2 mx5/ 
•sw20 mr2 turbos 


I’m open to other suggestions, I’ll also semi frequently update this thread with things I’ve researched and ruled out 

Currently on the no list 
•Vauxhalls full stop, I can’t afford the actually good ones (monaro / vx220) 
•mazdaspeed 3/6s , I’m aware they’re cool and cheap but look at what’s involved doing simple tasks like the injectors 
•abarth 500/595s, I’ve owned one before and it gave me horrid back ache but I will agree they’re cool

1otnwbi,Honda Jazz repair cost advice,"Hi, I'm not sure if this is the right place to post  but I'm looking for advice on repair cost 

I'm a new driver and this is my first car, purchased a 2006 Honda  Jazz less than 3 weeks ago for 3k. Single owner with clean recent MOT that test drove fine.

I took it into a local garage, highly rated/trusted in my area, today for a full service. They've said there's an issue with front suspension, I'm not entirely clear on the mechanical problem but I've uploaded a video of the underside. They've said there's no other issues.

They've quoted approx £800 to repair and said it would be dangerous to drive

I've spoken to the independent dealership I bought it from who've said they want me to drive it back to them 30 minutes away on the motorway and they will repair it for me.

1otjvxc,Is the GTI the perfect car?  (Should I get an M140i or another GTI),"Hey all,

Sorry for the post from an American.  This just seemed like an english speaking forum that would have knowledge of both the M140i and GTI since us yankees never got it.  

Until recently I was the happy owner of an MK8 GTI MT in kings red. In many respects I thought it was the perfect car. It has good, fun power that gives you a nice kick in the street, it tackled the tail of the dragon like a champ, it fit everything from my apartment when I moved, it gets me great MPG even when constantly driving like a hooligan **on regular**(!) and the icing on top was a month long road trip I did with my gf where we bought a small air mattress and slept in the back of the car the whole time and were shocked by how well it worked and comfort despite me being 6ft2 and her 5ft7. It just seems like the car does everything. I just love its power, with its efficiency and its practicality.

Well, the reason I sold it is because I moved to Germany. Here's the tough decision. As an American, a car I always dreamed of getting if I ever moved to Europe was an M140i, since we Americans never got it. However, the GTI, especially after this month long road trip, has really grown on my heart and now I'm torn. I can't decide if I should just pick up another GTI here in Germany or try out the M140i like I always dreamed of.

What makes me want the M140i is that it was always my goal, the b58 and the outright power and it being RWD and just such a cool car. However, even more so with European fuel prices sometimes I wonder if it's lower efficiency and more expensive gas will sting. I can more than easily afford it, but is it the right choice. It would also be a loss in some cool tech, specifically travel assist and ACC. Digital dash and all is nothing for me. I also almost worry if it's too much power, especially with the shorter, smaller roads in Europe compared to the US. What I like about the GTI is the feeling that I am absolutely flooring it and driving that whole car and am only hitting maybe 60-70 mph. I wonder if to get the M140i to feel engaging it has to get to such a ridiculous speed to even enjoy it. With the GTI it just feels so light and chuckable. I feel like the BMWs feel more weighty and serious, but is it still fun?

What would you guys do? I also feel like the M140i is at the bottom of its depreciation curve and if I really do miss the GTI, I can always resell the M140i without crazy loss.",0,1762795417.0,10,CartalkUK,1762889722,2025-11-10 17:23:37,2025-11-11 19:35:22,"lynch1986 (Score: 4): The M140i is renown for it's terrible rear suspension and inability to deal with shitty roads.

Having owned an m135i for two years now, they're in a different league.  Power, engine note, gearbox (auto), rear drive... for the money it's a thing of beauty.

Obviously the g87 isn’t an m140i, but it has some similarities (RWD, pokey engine, limited space in the back, BMW ‘aesthetics’ (a plus for some) etc. You’d keep the benefits of a hatchback with an m140i (not sure how the space compares to a golf) and get the RWD BMW experience with a b58 which is a hell of an engine. 

I love them both, but if I had an opportunity to drive a car like an m140i for a bit when I wouldn’t normally get the chance, that would be enough to make my mind up. Get an R or a GTI when you go home!

Or, you could go for an m2! I planned to get an m240i originally, but once I’d done the sums and looked around for the right spec, I settled on the g87 because it wasn’t that much more expensive and it’s an M car (which whatever people think are still a bit special when you’re driving one).

1othcy0,Car sold as Approved Used missing service,"I bought a Cupra Approved Used car in January 2025. One of the benefits of the scheme is that it has a 'Full service history check'.  In April 2025 I was told by another dealer the car had missed the Haldex oil service which should have been done in August 2024 when the car was 3 years old. 

The car also had other intermittent electrical faults and I officially rejected the car to the dealer within 6 months of purchasing it. They made me an offer at that time to buy it back for £3k less than I paid for it, having done only about 3000 miles at that point. IMHO this is too much of a loss

My understanding is that the missing service is a stronger case for taking action than the intermittent fault as it is very clear cut. It was advertised as an approved used car with a full service history check and it did not have a full service history and therefore was misrepresented at the time of the sale. 

I'm currently waiting for The Motor Ombudsman to allocate an investigator to the complaint but that might take up to another 3 months based on the timescale they gave me. I'm thinking just file legal proceedings through the county court and speed things up.

1otdvqd,Previous damage - insurer asking me to pay £1000 or accept bad repair,"So my CLA200 shooting brake was hit while parked back in May this year, other insurer has taken full liability. My insurer sent the car to a 3rd party approved garage for repairs as their network was booked up and they told me this would be the fastest option (good joke). It's been 6 months of shitshow from everyone involved, but the crux of the issue is that when they gave the car back to me the bumper looked like it was installed by a class of primary school kids. I've complained, and upon taking the car back to the garage the insurer is saying that the reason that the bumper isn't sitting right on the car is due to previous damage that wasn't repaired properly. In order to install the bumper properly now, they want me to pay ~ £1000 for parts or they'll just put it back together again as it was and call it a day. 

I concede that there was previous damage (unknown to me, I only had the car for 2 months before it was hit, but clear once the bumper has been removed) but the bumper sat perfectly prior to this accident. 

At this point the insurance engineer is saying that I'm shit out of luck, and even if it looked fine before this is still related to previous damage and they will refuse to cover it. 

Do I have any comeback / argument? My argument is that I'm not getting the car back in the condition it was prior to the crash, and if the bumper could be installed to look perfect prior to the crash then either this crash has amplified the damage and it should be covered, or if this crash has not affected the previously damaged areas then it should be possible to install it so that it looks good on the outside without any further parts purchased, but they're not budging.

OneRandomOtaku (Score: 13): Former car insurance claims handler here! 

So previous accident damage is tricky because if the accident happens to be to a previously damaged area then it can conflict with the concept of avoiding betterment. Ie, insurance is there to indemnify loss, not put you in a better position than you would have been in had the accident not happened. If they repair the damage that was there previously then you would be in a better position than you would've otherwise been in. The issue is, if they do repair the damage that was there, that cost won't be recovered from the other insurance company when it comes to finalize the claim, that then means you don't get a ""non-fault"" claim. 

Generally I'd be looking at a cash in lieu of repairs if its poaaible, you have an argument that the damages have worsened the value of the vehicle and ultimately the claim is not for the repair its for the diminution in value of the chattel, reasonable repairs excluding preexisting damage is merely the most common method of quantification (Coles v Hetherton) so while most of the diminution is being rectified by the repairs by the insurer there's still an outstanding amount of diminution in value that can't be repaired which makes a cash in lieu an appropriate option to settle, Appeals court has held previously that reasonable repairs may not fully quantify the loss (Payton v Brooks). The question is how much is appropriate as too much being paid could give rise to a dispute over costs on the basis of causation (basically the argument that the other party are not the ones who caused the full damage) 

Generally speaking that amount is entirely dependent upon an engineer assessment confirming the amount and the reduction for preexisting damage. Critically though, if the insurance engineer is saying that it wouldn't have been damaged at all except for the preexisting damage (for example the preexisting damage caused a structural weakness meaning a slight bump caused it to shift) then  that's unlikely to be recovered and you're not going to have much luck even if you go to the FOS.

If you go down the HP route, maximise your deposit. If you go down the PCP or PCH route, minimise your deposit as you likely won't see a return on it. 

Fuel type can also have an impact. Depreciation on EVs for example has been pretty horrendous. A PCP offers some level of protection in the sense that you have a guaranteed future value so you'll know exactly what the car will be worth in 4 years as long as you return it in good condition and within the agreed mileage. This again however is only a benefit if you won't be keeping it forever. 

Also, regardless of what type of finance you choose, don't always go with the dealer. Lots of banks offer HP and PCP with significantly lower interest rates than most dealers would offer you.

Lastly don't finance at all and spend the £5,000 on buying a car outright. Depending on what type of car you're after £5k is more than enough to buy something modern and reliable."

1otaqye,"Is BMW sabotaging my car, or am I just unlucky?","Hi everyone,

I’d really appreciate some perspective on what’s happened with my dad’s 2019 BMW 520d.

We took it for a **routine service at a BMW-approved centre (Hedin Automotive in Enfield, London, United Kingdom)** at the end of September. Right after that service, the **windscreen washer stopped working.** It had been perfectly fine before.

When we called the centre, they said we’d have to pay **£190 for an inspection**, even though the fault appeared *immediately after* their service. When my dad spoke to them, they insisted on the charge. When I spoke on his behalf, their tone changed and they said if it turned out to be their fault, they wouldn’t charge us.

That mixed messaging made me uneasy. Part of me felt like they’d already decided it *wouldn’t* be their fault, which meant they’d still end up charging us. I didn’t trust that they’d assess it fairly after how they’d spoken to my dad. So I contacted **BMW UK customer service** because I felt stuck: they caused the issue, but I didn’t trust them to be honest about it, and at the same time there was a **recall on the starter motor** that needed doing too. I was in a bind about what to do next.

Customer service wasn’t much help either: multiple dropped calls, inconsistent advice, and no one taking responsibility.

Eventually, I sent an email directly to the dealership. In it, I said something along the lines of: *“Please confirm that you will inspect the washer free of charge. If you find it to be service-related, fix it free of charge. If it’s not service-related, please let me know what the issue is and I’ll get it done elsewhere. The recall I’ll do at another dealership.”*

That email prompted the **service manager** to call me personally. He apologised for how his team had treated my dad and said they’d check the washer free of charge. He then asked if I’d like to do the recall there as well, and I agreed.

A few days after the recall was completed, **the car broke down last night at a traffic light.** The engine cut out (it’s the model with auto start-stop) and wouldn’t restart. I was stranded for four hours and ended up paying **£320 for recovery** to get the car home.

BMW Emergency Assistance said they couldn’t collect it free of charge. I’ve emailed both the dealership and BMW UK about the situation since this problem happened *immediately after the recall work.*

When I called the service manager this morning, he said they’ll “check to see if what’s happened is service-related,” which is the exact phrase I’d used in my earlier email. Maybe it’s coincidence, but something about the whole situation feels off. It could just be intuition, but part of me worries there’s some spite involved after the complaint I raised.

Has anyone else experienced issues like this after a recall or service? Am I overthinking this, or does it sound like poor workmanship or negligence on their end?

Any advice or similar stories would really help, especially from people who’ve dealt with Hedin Automotive or BMW UK customer service.

Thanks.

The restarting may be to do with their starter motor replacement, but you’d need to read codes off the car to find out. That does seem likely though. It’s easy to forget to nip up a bolt or not have a plug seated correctly etc.

You’re doing around 12 - 13,000 per year, I’m doing a little more at around 15,000. 

My car is an 11 year old Passat, so not dissimilar, especially to the A6. 
Servicing, maintenance and repairs runs to about 11-13 pence per mile which isn’t far off £2,000 per year. 

I argue it’s a lot less than the depreciation a newer car would suffer and I know the car inside out. It’s like triggers broom now 😂, with 170,000 miles on it.

Scotty848 (Score: 5): Not really, at least not from the era you’re looking at anyway. Volvo literally built their entire reputation on high mileage. Is that an option? Almost certainly more reliable. 

Otherwise, the 1.6TDI and 2.0TDI that can be found on Audis (more likely Skodas/Passats) can do high miles if maintained well. 

Avoid engines with known defects, e.g. timing chains in bimmers."

1ot6p94,SUV recommendations,"Hi everyone, ive been on this sub for years through various accounts,  but first time posting. 

I don't have a dad, brothers or male figures in my life and my car knowledge is pretty limited. So would love your advice.

I'm looking to get my first SUV maybe in Jan or Feb. I've always had older cars (10+ years) and would like to treat myself to a nice car. Please advise what you would go for? My criteria are: 

- SUV 

- Ideally 2021 or newer

- petrol hybrid (still looking into the difference of the two different petrol hybrid options)

- automatic

- engine size 1.6 or more 

- prize £13,000 - 17,000

- something very reliable and economical to maintain/repair ",0,1762756491.0,20,CartalkUK,1762889722,2025-11-10 06:34:51,2025-11-11 19:35:22,"Away_Associate4589 (Score: 3): The obvious suggestion is a VW Tiguan. They're very ""VAG"" in terms of how they drive. Easy to use, slightly conservative, comfy, won't depreciate as much as some. They are a little expensive though so you'd be looking at either one with a lower/ mid trim level or slightly higher mileage. Personally I'd look at the Skora Karoq as well. The boot isn't quite as big but it's fundamentally the same car, just a bit better value. You could say the same for the Seat Ateca.

The Kia Sportage and Hyundai Tucson are a bit better value and you'll be able to get one which is very well equipped within your budget. You'd also probably still be able to get one under the manufacturer warranty, especially if you went approved used from a main dealer.

Personally my choice would be the Peugeot 3008. Mainly because I think they look quite striking, they're very good value and the interior is almost certainly the nicest of any of its competitors. 

Your best bet would be to go to one of those big car supermarket places and at least sit in 3 or 4 and drive 1 or 2 so you can get a feel for what you like.

Edit: I'd also look at the Mazda CX5. Imo they're quite good looking as far as SUVs go. They have very nice interiors, quite well equipped and if you steer clear of the diesel and get a petrol version they're pretty reliable.

1ot2b9b,Insurance help,"Hi, I’m buying a new car on Wednesday from a city quite far from me. It’s from a BMW main dealer and after being linked the page to their drive away insurance I checked that I fit the criteria. A week later now that I’ve decided on purchasing the car, I put all my info in, it says I’m not eligible. It is not a “high performance” model at all.. being an f36 420i, and the insurance is still valid for a hypothetical 25 year old person who I put on to check if it is because I’m younger than 30 (I’m 19). Very frustrating as I mentioned the fact I’m 19 and fit the rest of the criteria to the salesman and he told me it should be fine.

Regardless, I really need to drive the car home, and I need it for major plans the following week before my main insurance policy starts on the 17th. It is impossible for me to find temporary insurance, so I figure my only option is to take out an annual policy and cancel it after 5 days. My question is, as the wording on the website is quite ambiguous on this specific case, apart from paying the £25 cancellation fee, if I’m paying it monthly and cancel 5 days in, am I then refunded for the remainder of the month? Or do they keep the ‘initial deposit’ money and take the extra £25 and I don’t get anything back from them.

Any help appreciated, thanks!",1,1762742268.0,67,CartalkUK,1762889722,2025-11-10 02:37:48,2025-11-11 19:35:22,"Kind-Mathematician18 (Score: 12): You get a 14 day cooling off period when buying insurance in which you can cancel the policy - as long as no claims arise during that period.  So yes, theoretically you can take out a policy and cancel it after 5 days.  Your refund would be pro rata plus any other charges.  Just don't crash the car in that period.

Insurance premiums are only ever paid in a single lump sum, up front.  These offers to pay ""monthly"" are not monthly payments to an insurer, a finance company pays the full premium on your behalf and you pay the finance company the monthly subscriptions.  So if you do crash the car, you'll have to pay the full annual premium - there'll be no refund.

I shudder to think what your premiums will be on a brand new BMW 420i.

1oszuos,2006 Mitsubishi Lancer- should I buy,"Hi, I’m looking for a starter car, and found a 2006 Mitsubishi Lancer semiautomatic for a really good deal.

However, the car is quite old and looks and feels quite old- and when I asked for a service history, the dealer couldn’t provide one.

I don’t know whether to get it now, the mileage is ~55,000 and it felt fine when I was driving it, but I’m really split on whether to get it or not!",1,1762735265.0,7,CartalkUK,1762889722,2025-11-10 00:41:05,2025-11-11 19:35:22,shoopaaa (Score: 1): How much are they asking?

1osz41j,Weird situation with used car,"I recently bought a 2002 used car from a private seller (2nd owner). Did an HPI check, all clear, not marked as an import. However, seller says it's euro spec and he had to change the headlights to match UK. It also came with an EU certificate of conformity. The car is LHD, but they were never made RHD so that tells me nothing. The V5 has dates of reg in UK as first date of reg. Interestingly registration is 2003, but model year from VIN is 2002. Seller also told me the previous owner was a dealer, and it was his personal car. 

A lot of stuff points to it being an import from new, but the HPI check says otherwise, that it's not an import.

What to tell the insurance? Imports can be very hard to insure, and this car seems to not ""officially"" be an import. And being open about it may just unnecessarily open a can of worms, as it appears to ""not"" be an import anyway. Just a EU spec car somehow ending up in UK without import... could it be the dealer had access to internal channels allowing him to do that more easily? I.e. get a new car from a EU dealer into his own dealership without openly importing it and then buying it directly from the UK market i.e. his own shop?

1osz28i,Goodwood Revival,"I’m trying to plan a 2026 trip to take my dad to the Goodwood Revival as a Christmas gift (I’m from the US). He’s a huge British sports car lover and owns a few. I also have a Healey so I can’t think of a better trip for us. The race(s) are surely a major part of the trip but his highlight would be seeing all the cars (as close as possible). 

For anyone who’s actually been I’d love to hear your experiences and any advice you may have.

What’s the best way to do it (ticket packages, accommodation, etc)? Anything a must see / do? 
 
I found this package on their website:
“GRRC Ultimate Access Package: Experience the best that the Goodwood Revival has to offer with access to the private Gordon Pavilion, the Pitlane Rooftop and private guided tours of the Drivers' Club and Assembly Area.” It’s pricey (517£ each + 90£ for the GRRC fellowship which would allow u to purchase this package I think) but money is not an issue as I would like to make it an unforgettable experience (plane tickets would also be a good chunk of change). Is this package worth it? 

In a perfect world, I’d plan on on spending a few extra days touring around England visiting historic factories, museums, etc. 

Im going to do much of my own research but wanted to throw this into a couple groups and get some insight from others who have been to get a start on it before Christmas and hammer out the details afterwards. Trying to make this an unforgettable trip. Thank you for any insight!

Definitely factor in travel time, the Chichester area gets absolutely overrun during these things.

Also the Goodwood hotel is a pretty good one to stay at, definitely has that rustic English vibe.

Make sure you go see Cambridge, it’s my favourite city in the UK.

Have fun!

SneekSpeek (Score: 2): Hi, I would ring the ticket office to confirm what would be available to you as a member of the fellowship. As far as I'm aware the Gordon enclosure is only for full members. The ticket office will be able to advise you on getting the most out of your day. Paddock passes are a must if you can get them as that allows you to get up close and personal with the cars off the track"
