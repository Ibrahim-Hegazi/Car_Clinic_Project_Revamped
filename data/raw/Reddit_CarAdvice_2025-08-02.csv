1mfbywn,Cursed Mercedes or needle in a haystack? Light driving load misfires and hesitation,"# 2010 Mercedes E63 AMG (M156) - Persistent Hesitation/Lurching Issue

**Current Mileage:**¬†88,000  
**Issue Duration:**¬†Since purchase in October 2024, getting progressively worse

# PRIMARY SYMPTOMS:

* Hesitation/lurching at steady speeds (20-90 mph)
* Most prominent at 1.5-2k RPM under light load
* **Worse on slight inclines with minimal throttle, low speeds**
* Mostly occurs at full operating temp (210¬∞F oil/195¬∞F coolant)
* Accompanied by low-frequency vibration from drivetrain
* Cylinder 7 shows minor misfires during events (not enough for codes)
* Separate issue maybe?: Occasional rough start with multiple cylinder misfires and flashing CEL requiring restart (happened 3 times total since ownership)

# EXTENSIVE WORK COMPLETED:

**Ignition System:**

* All spark plugs (new OEM)
* All coil packs (new OEM)
* All fuel injectors (new OEM)

**Engine Work:**

* Head bolts (OEM revised)
* Camshaft adjusters rebuilt (63 Motorsports kit)
* Camshaft lifters/tappets replaced
* Valve cover gaskets
* Crankcase vent valve (PCV)
* Cam position sensors & cam solenoids (Bank 2)

**Fuel/Air/Exhaust:**

* MAF sensors cleaned (already clean, tested unplugged - same issue)
* Throttle pedal replaced - from separate issue
* All O2 sensors replaced (Bank 2 upstream replaced twice)
* **Catalytic converters just cleaned**¬†\- Driver side was ""100% dirty"" (0.32 PSI backpressure)
* Intake manifold cleaned / resealed
* Throttle bodies cleaned

**Electrical/Other:**

* ECU swapped with known good unit - no change
* ECU software updated
* Wiring harness verified (although I'm not sure exactly to what extent)
* Engine grounds verified
* Both batteries replaced (OEM)
* Alternator replaced (had a complete alternator failure)
* Full transmission service with adaptations
* Rear driveshaft flex joint replaced

# DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS:

* Compression: 190-215 PSI (Bank 2 slightly lower)
* Leakdown: 2.3-5.9% (within spec)
* Fuel trims: Within spec
* Bank 2 showed oil seepage into cylinders (valve guides suspected)
* Bank 2 cam timing was unstable but¬†**normalized at some point (unsure exactly at what point)**
* Previous shop noted cylinder 7 coil signal ""didn't seem quite right""

# QUESTIONS FOR THE COMMUNITY:

1. **Should I drive 200+ miles to see if the clogged cat was the root cause?**
2. **Or should I pursue cylinder 7 oscilloscope testing during specific events?**
3. **Could this be two separate issues?**
   * Rough start / misfires = fuel pump check valve
   * Cruise hesitation = residual effects from clogged cat or carbon deposits?
4. **What about carbon cleaning?**¬†Given symptoms are worst at low speed/slight incline (maximum cylinder pressure), would direct injection cleaning help?

I'm at a crossroads: The clogged cat discovery seems significant (maybe?), but I've already spent months and thousands of dollars chasing this issue. One of the best local Mercedes Indy's was at a complete loss, but I'm considering oscilloscope diagnosis of cylinder 7 based on previous ""signal anomaly"" comment.

**What would you do next? I'm really open to anything at this point short of a top-end rebuild or new engine. I'm the Seattle area so I'd be open to any shop rec's also but I've probably already talked to most of the Mercedes specialists in the area.**",1,1754091983,3,MechanicAdvice,1754163175,8/1/2025 23:46,8/2/2025 19:32,"Regular_Particular17 (Score: 1): How confident are we in those cam adjusters, like was this done awhile ago or in the hopes of fixing your issue ?

I tasted it and it was obviously coolant so I popped the hood. Overflow reservoir was empty so I started to try to hunt down the leak. I got to the lower radiator hose and gave it a squeeze and it started to drip from where it connects to the thermostat housing. Grabbed a pair of pliers to try to loosen the clamp and the clamp snapped in half. 

I called around to the local part stores and they don't have any correct spring clamps for it. Even called the parts dept for the local gm dealership and he said to just use a screw clamp but it doesn't sound right to me. 

Am I good to use a screw clamp or do I need to go find a new spring clamp so I can get this truck back on the road?

1mf4pma,Road Trip and Converter Question,"2014 Toyota Corolla L  / 4 Cylinder  1.8L Engine 
255K Miles

Hello all! I would like to make an 11hr trip from KY to LA. My only issue is I know the catalytic converter on my car ""needs""(?) to be replaced. Everything else is fine on it aside from missing the front bumper but that's purely cosmetic and both my headlights still work.

I don't know much about cars at all but in every shop I've taken it to to inquire about the converter (I've asked during oil changes and routine maintenance) the mechanic tells me it's not really a big deal and to get it changed ""eventually"". They just kinda shrug it off. I took it to one reputable muffler shop in town in January and the mechanic looked under my car and explained that nothing looked ""burnt"" and that I was ""okay for a while"". They also mentioned a cleaning service they do, but would that do any good?

What I currently understand about catalytic converters is that they're for exhaust and fuel efficiency. I haven't noticed anything strange about my car aside from being slow to accelerate when going up hills - aside from that, all good. The engine sounds a little noisy when running compared to other cars I've ridden in but no clangin' or bangin' just the reving. God, I hope that makes sense.
I'm so sorry I know this is probably really vague. I keep up with all the maintenance on this car and I LOVE my Toyota but a new converter for it, that I've seen anyway, ranges from $200-$2K and I suppose I could go into a shop and ask for an estimate and I don't mind paying for it but I guess I'd like to completely understand the level of urgency here and about what I can expect to pay roughly.

Help!,"I found some pinkish-red drips on the ground yesterday morning, and saw that it could point towards the transmission, power steering fluid, or coolant, so I checked those three and only the transmission fluid is that color. Then looked underneath and saw that it's collecting on what I think is the transmission pan (new to this!). The front half of the pan glistens and the back side appears dry. And it looks like there's a lot of corrosion around the edges? I'd really appreciate some more experienced advice on what I'm looking at here.

And also, while checking it all, I found that the power steering fluid is way below minimum. Almost at the bottom of the little reservoir. A few weeks ago I saw it while checking the oil and it was at the minimum mark, so I made a note to refill it and watch it but didn't follow through. There's no sounds or anything while driving, and there's no leaking that I've noticed over the last few weeks until now with the transmission fluid, so I'm unsure on what to do next. 

Currently I'm figuring I'll pick up a pint of each and refill them, and hopefully get into a mechanic early next week if needed. I'd prefer to learn how to do any work myself, as I'm still new and wanting to learn and have the time and not the money for it, but I'm also not trying to screw up my transmission.

|Tests/Procedures:|1. Test the EGR valve position sensor voltage. Normal values are as follows: Key On Engine Off (KOEO) = 4.2 volts. At 30% duty cycle the valve just starts to open. At 35% duty cycle voltage is approximately 3.2 volts. At 50% duty cycle voltage is approximately 2.2 volts. The scan tool should have an ""EGR System Test"" built in, so the valve can be run bi- directionally and commanded to various duty cycles while monitoring the feedback voltage from the position sensor. 2. If the EGR valve needs to be replaced, be sure to disconnect the battery and hold the cables together for 1 minute. This will clear out the EGR Adaptive Memory. Failure to do this step may result in further EGR system codes.|
|Tech Tips:|The Pink/Yellow wire is the 5-volt reference voltage. The Dark Blue/Dark Green wire is the sensor ground circuit. The Dark Blue/Light Green wire is the signal wire to the Powertrain Control Module (PCM). While driving a ""known good"" vehicle, the PCM never commanded more than 50% duty cycle to the EGR valve.|

Strange_Penalty5110 (Score: 4): Depends. Most likely cause is the EGR system is plugged and/or your EGR valve is stuck.

I originally thought it was another misfire being the 5.4 that it is, so I replaced all the sparks and coils but went around the block to see if it was still no power and what I thought was a misfire.

I got it started and drove around the block and the transmission line that connected to the radiator blew out and dumped transmission fluid everywhere, so I killed the truck immediately and reinstalled the line with fresh fluid and that‚Äôs where I saw someone else had the clip that it held it on backwards so the line just plopped out.

I instantly thought the worse so I had it towed to a local shop. 

The shop had it for 2 days where they did not the drop pan only scanned it and told me that it was blown and will need to be replaced and then quoted me 4K

But, you should start with the easier stuff, check the condenser fan relay and the A/C compressor clutch relay, which are supposedly behind the left side front bumper in or near the fuse box. Relays over time develop pitting in the contacts from switching heavy currents, and the sputtered metal and soot causes a bad connection that can cause high current draw and fuse blowing. It can also damage the coil and cause weird shorts.

If you pull the relay and see that the blade connectors are discolored (black or blue), replace them.

Next thing to check would be the electric radiator fans, it looks like your car has two. Use a broom handle or a long screwdriver to gently rotate the blades. The blades should spin freely, if you feel any resistance, then the fans are bad and need to be replaced. Fans that have bad bearings or are gummed up internally will draw excessive current and cause blown fuses.

Since you didn't specify which fuse was blown, it makes it harder to know where the problem is. The diagram shows that fuse 17, 21 and 24 are responsible for different parts of the A/C system. If you know which one blows, it can narrow it down."

If you look down at your feet, and point your toes inwards, that is the same as ‚Äútoe in‚Äù on your tires. Same thing for pointing your toes outwards. The tie rods have and inner end which is connected to the steering rack and is threaded like a bolt. The outer end is connected to the steering knuckle and is hollow and threaded on the inside. A nut is threaded onto the inner end and then used to ‚Äúlock‚Äù against the outer end to prevent the tie rod from going out of adjustment.

If the lock nut and outer tie rod end become rusted to the inner tie rod shaft, it cannot be adjusted. Sometimes penetrating oil or heat can help loosen them but sometimes the simply have to be replaced. Hope this helps!

I've owned this Honda Civic for a couple months now and haven't had this problem prior but it has been extraordinarily hot lately ( 95-97 Degrees on a pitch black car ) and the past two days of this weather the AC in my car has not been blowing.

To be specific it's not blowing air \*at all\* rather than blowing weakly or blowing hot air. Then at night when I get off work it blows perfectly and has excellent cold air as it has been since I got it.

My assumption is naturally that the heat is the issue and the weather will be cooling off back to levels where it has worked fine previously ( upper-mid 80's ) soon so it may well not be an issue at all but just in case I figured it would be harmless to ask yall about it before I take old betsy into the shop.

You‚Äôre taking the instrument cluster apart to for that to gain access wherever it hooks on. Easy peezy, hardest part of the cluster coming out is the Speedo cable connector on the back.

2006 Ford Ranger fx4

Hey I am looking for some help with a problem I have been trying to troubleshoot for a little bit.

When I drive up a steep hill, after driving for about an hour already, it sometimes dies on me. It seemed like it was the fuel pump that wasn‚Äôt delivering fuel. However after I waited about 30-45 min it started up just fine and I was able to drive it around for a few days. I replaced the fuel filter thinking that may have been clogged. It happened again twice more several days later. Same thing, it just cranks but does not start and after 30-45 min it starts perfectly fine again.

It didn‚Äôt do it after a few weeks when i had my AC turned off (thinking it was stalling because  the AC was drawing too much power) but it happened again and the ac was off‚Ä¶

With the ac off, Yesterday I drove down and after about an hour and a half of driving (on a hot day) it stalled again. Waited 1 hour, tried some trouble shooting and it eventually started again. I drove for 15min and it died again. I tried putting some seafoam in my fuel which didn‚Äôt do much. Again waited 45min and it started just fine but died once more about 15min later. I eventually towed it home.

This morning I tested the relay switch and fuse again and they are all in good order still. The truck started up perfectly without any trouble.

Everything leads me to believe it could be the fuel pump, however I am confused why it would die on me and start up again after waiting 45 min. It‚Äôs especially weird why it does not have a problem starting for a few days/weeks after it happened.

I have also asked a mechanic and he also had no clue as of now.

I have tried looking up this issue on multiple forums and have not found anything with the same issue.

My truck was not overheating,
Temp gauge is working fine,
There are no codes,
All fuses and relays have been checked,
New fuel filter,
New spark plugs,
New air filter,
Even jump starting it (since it‚Äôs a manual) did not work.

I don‚Äôt want to spend the money yet on a new fuel pump as it just seems weird to me why it works perfectly fine, but after it gets too hot it dies and only works again after waiting 45min.

I have noticed yesterday that one of my catalytic converters was extremely hot compared to the other one, I checked this after the truck died the second time. I saw online that a clogged cat could also have similar issues, but then again I am confused why it stops working and works fine after waiting 45 min. (I hope this is not the issue as these are not cheap)

So basically the issues I‚Äôm having are:

-It sometimes stalls on a long steep hill after driving for a while.

- at high revs (when trying to overtake let‚Äôs say) it sometimes stutters, almost feels like it‚Äôs misfiring, but it‚Äôs more like it‚Äôs lagging.

-it lacks power because of the stutters and it has done this since I bought the truck (used). I have added a whole bunch of weight since (winch, bumpers, canopy, boat rack, etc) however it was doing it a little before adding all this weight.

-fuel consumption has also never been the greatest. But it‚Äôs an 4.0 so these aren‚Äôt the best to begin with.

(The stuttering could be because it‚Äôs too sensitive if I‚Äôm not in the correct gear on time, however I had a 07 ford ranger fx4 (manual as well)with a truck camper on it and I have never had an issue with this, even if I was still in too high of gear trying to step on it/overtaking)

Proper fix, you need to see what‚Äôs happening.  I suspect the switch that turns on the fans isn‚Äôt working since bypassing it made everything work.  The switch for the fans is likely a different sensor than the one that feeds the temp gauge since it‚Äôs an on/off instead of a sweep.  

It‚Äôs probably cheap/easy enough to just swap out that temp switch since it‚Äôs an intermittent issue, then you can monitor and adjust. Have the ability to ‚Äújump‚Äù the fans in case you need to until you‚Äôve done enough tests that you‚Äôre comfortable saying it‚Äôs fixed. 

Also - typically turning on the AC manually turns the fans on, regardless of engine temp. You should double check if that‚Äôs working as designed."

Why did you add freon? Unless you had a leak, there is no reason to add freon.

The first thing to do is hook a set of gauges to it. There are so many things that can cause ac not to work, and you‚Äôre not gonna know the issue without gauges.

Hook gauges up, turn on car and ac. Look at the ac compressor. Is the clutch engaged and spinning? 

If yes look at your gauges, if the low and hi side pressures are about the same, the compressor is bad and you have to rebuild the whole system (dont let anyone tell you to flush it, its a scam). 

If the high side is at least 160 (I need to know the temperature outside to have a better number to give you) but he low side is low and staying low (never over 25) you have a blockage on the high side somewhere, most likely the evap. 

If the low side is bouncing up and down while high side is normal  you have a blockage on the low side, most likely an orifice tube or expansion valve depending which one you have. If you have this issue, might as well change the compressor too, bc if you don‚Äôt it will fail after changing the orifice/exp valve.  ** note if you have an exp valve it can cause your pressures to read wrong if it goes bad, if you have a proper charge but your pressures just seem a little high (low over 40 is what your mainly looking for) the exp valve is bad, change it and the accumulator  bag in the condenser.

If its not spinning check pressures if the pressures are both reading like 40-50 on each side or lower its a low charge. Add little bits to see if it comes on, if it does check for leaks and repair. If the pressures are about 50-70 on each side something isnt sending a signal saying its able to operate. The usual suspect is the low pressure switch. You can test this by bypassing the switch (when doing this dont let low side go under 20 or you will kill your compressor), if it comes on, change the switch, if it doesnt test to make sure your getting voltage to the switch and the ground is good. If no power, check fuse. If you have power and no ground, fix ground. If its anything more then this its not hard to check its just a ton of typing. Just dm me if its none of these.


Please keep in mind, im not there so I dont know all the conditions. Example say your actual ac system is working fine, but you have a bad blend door motor for the temp blend, that can cause it as well.

1mf6ig5,Never ending issue,"Good evening everyone! 

I‚Äôve been having a weird misfire issue with my C7 Audi A6 and so I brought it in to the mechanic shop I‚Äôve been bringing my car to because previously they had been quick, had great communication, and have fair rates for the work they do(it‚Äôs a German performance shop). 

I dropped it off April 3rd to them for them to diagnose and over the course of the next month they would not update me or anything on the car and I would have to be the one to reach out which had never been the issue before. I would text them about once a week to see if anything got figured out since the car was being diagnosed not repaired and I would get told I‚Äôd get called and would never get called until I texted them again (usually with a ‚Äú?‚Äù The day after they were supposed to call me) and then they‚Äôd answer and call an hour or two later. It got to a point where I just felt like they weren‚Äôt even diagnosing my car or working on it so I texted them asking them when I could go pick it up. They then proceeded to tell me that the car is now in worse shape and should not even be turned on so I thought I‚Äôd just leave it so they can finish diagnosing to figure out what made it worse.

After a month of that and supposedly checking coils, spark plugs, fuel injectors, supercharger core, gaskets, ecu, and I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm missing something else (but I‚Äôll update if I remember) it turned out to be that my cylinders had low compression. So they gave me two options 1) rebuild the engine with stock or forged internals and 2) do an engine swap. By this point I had a good amount of preventative maintenance to the block so I figured I just rebuild the engine because if the new engine would‚Äôve needed that maintenance it would‚Äôve come out to the same price and I figured a forged internal engine could be more fun for future projects. 

I take about a week to think it through because this is also my daily that I use to commute to work, school, and my internship which my internship is about an hour to an hour and a half a way depending on traffic. 

I come to the conclusion that I‚Äôm going to rebuild the engine so tell them and approve the work on a website they sent me where I approve which job I want and sign off. I made sure to ask how long this would take because I needed to have reliable transportation for my internship and I got told 1month but 2 months max which I was okay with. After that it takes them 2 weeks to tell me they need me to send them the money for the parts so they can order them and they said it usually takes a couple weeks for the parts to come in. After a little over a month I ask them how much longer for the car to be ready to which I get told that the week prior to that they contacted the company where they ordered the parts from and were told that the parts wouldn‚Äôt arrive for another 3-5 weeks(so by then it‚Äôd be 2-4 weeks). Two weeks later I ask about the parts and I get told that the parts would come in the following week. Two weeks later I ask if the parts came in and they said that they‚Äôd come in that week. One week later they said they have some but the rest would come in that week and that they‚Äôd were going to start tearing the car apart soon. It‚Äôs now been almost two weeks since then and I called them two days ago to see how much longer they were going to take. They answered the call and said they‚Äôd let me know by the end of the day‚Ä¶. The day ends and they don‚Äôt tell me anything so yesterday I texted them again and they said that they‚Äôre estimating another 2-3 weeks but that they‚Äôd call me to confirm. I didn‚Äôt get a call and still haven‚Äôt gotten a call.

You'll likely be able to complete this repair with only basic tools. I've done a similar repair on many other cars (not yours specifically) with only screwdrivers, pliers, and maybe an adjustable wrench once or twice.

In a huge pinch, you may be able to duct tape the hose to eliminate the air leaks. Its not the right way, but if you need to get to work and survive, it could buy you some time to wait for the correct part.

This morning I've noticed some steam coming from what looks like the air intake pipe, after popping the plastic off the engine (pictured). Was doing some routine maintenance just after driving..

I have a 2004 VW Passat, 2.0 Petrol manual

The car has some known issues, i'll briefly list them below in case it's relevant:

\- Sometimes, after driving, the car doesn't like idling. I mean the revs go below 700rpm and then bounce higher, on repeat. Think something with a vacuum hose ? Was driving downhill and went into neutral, engine died because RPM went too low.  
\- Have to keep topping up coolant liquid \~ monthly. Told there's a leak - maybe at pump.  
\- Have to keep topping up oil (about 1/4 of the small bottles, maybe 200ml every \~6 months).

Had the car diagnosed with a bunch of other mechanical issues, which are good to know about and might get to later..

Thank you!

A flickering battery light, even for a second, is often the first sign that your alternator is on its way out, especially since you've been through this before. While charging your phone and other gadgets adds a load, it's not enough to cause that light to flicker on a healthy system.
You can check it yourself with a multimeter. With the engine running, test the voltage directly at the alternator's main output terminal and then at the battery terminals. You should see a reading somewhere between 13.8V and 14.7V. If the voltage is low at the alternator, that's a pretty clear sign it's failing. You should also compare the alternator and battery readings; if there's more than a 0.5V difference, you might have a wiring issue.

Shops get the wrong belts all the time, there's usually a bunch of different options for each engine, this happens because people forget to compare the old belt to the new one to confirm it's the correct size.

1mf6lp8,Dealership ¬£500 reservation fee,"Hi,

Went to view a car this week at a car dealership. It was due to go into the bodyshop for cosmetic works as there were various scratches/dents to be repaired. For this reason I also couldn't take it for a test drive.

I said I'd go away and think about it, but salesperson said if I leave, he'd have to tell his other customer who was very interested and I'd potentially lose dibs on it. I ended up saying fine, I'll reserve it in that case and have a think while I sorted things out on my end and while it went through its cosmetic repairs. (This is because my purchase was based on WeBuyAnyCar giving me the full offer they'd suggested, as they were yet to inspect my car in-person).

I asked that if - for whatever reason - I did not agree with WeBuyAnyCar and ended up having to walk away from the deal, whether I'd get my ¬£500 back. The salesperson said ""yes, we're not allowed to keep it"" and ""we'd work with you on an offer anyway"".

Before leaving, they completed a 'Needs and Demands' questionnaire, basically running through my finance options and asking me to confirm that I'd seen the car in person and not by distance. (They said this was a legal requirement, even though I'd be a cash buyer).

A day later, I changed my mind on the car for a variety of reasons, and have emailed asking for my fee back, and that I'm walking away from the deal. The salesperson is umm'ing & arr'ing about whether this can be returned to me now, despite being told they weren't allowed to keep it!

Am I entitled to this back? I only reserved it pending a full offer from my prospective buyer, and also based on the car being in suitable condition after it had its bodywork complete (I was told they'd be replacing the windscreen and front bumper, and later that day got told they'd only be getting repaired) - so it wasn't sale ready when I saw it and condition/description was not as described anyway.

Feel stupid for not getting it in writing that it was refundable, but I didn't get a single document from them - only a receipt from the card machine. I did use a credit card which I'm hoping is a saving grace, so may be able to use Section 75 or Chargeback.

1mf2nb2,Goodbye diamond cut üëã,"Kerbed one of my wheels last Sunday. 
Monday I booked the car in at the wheel refurbisher and today it got done. Decided to have all 4 powder coated in Shadow Chrome rather than have the diamond cut wheel fixed. I‚Äôm so pleased with how it looks. I much prefer it to the original finish. 

On the downside the wheel refurbisher said that whoever originally fitted my tyres had damaged the bead of one tyre (pictured) and they were unwilling to refit it. All 4 tyres were fitted 4 months ago by Kwik Fit. I know it will be impossible to prove who actually caused the damage however I‚Äôve used this wheel refurbisher many times over the years with various cars and never had a single issue with them. Whereas Kwik Fit messed up the balancing on all 4 wheels when they did the tyres and had to rebalance them again the following day. The wheel place suggested they didn‚Äôt use enough of that soap stuff they smear about to lube the tyre as they fit it and thinking back to when I had the tyres fitted I didn‚Äôt see them use any of it (I lingered outside and watched them) so I think it‚Äôs safe to lay the blame for the ruined tyre with Kwik Fit. Oh well. The joys of motoring. Nothing I can do about it. 

Anyway. Well pleased with the wheels. I used Romax in Stockton. Replacement tyre was supplied by C&S tyres in Middlesbrough who are also superb (I‚Äôve used these before too and should have used them instead of Kwik Fit last time). 

On a side note I‚Äôve had the Rolla 9 months now and highly recommend them. I had 121mpg out of it the other week coming home from the shops. My monthly average is only around 55mpg because I do a lot of short trips (that I should walk really) but on any sort of decent run it‚Äôll easily do 60 - 70mpg.

Some of this is dependant on you being able to do home charging, I charge my EV for 9p/kWh at home but out on the street it could be anything from 30p to 79p. I don't mind the premium for a super fast charger a few times a year but I'd notice that if I was doing it every time I charged up.

Maintenance is very low, apart from the things which all cars will need like tyres and suspension generally an EV is going to run you less year on year as they have less fluids which need changing, less moving parts to break and less brake wear due to regeneration.

Depending on where you go it may also save you in low emission zone fees and lower parking costs.

200+ mile range EVs are not the cheapest out there in the second hand market but now there's more EVs on the market generally they're coming down into what I feel are sensible prices.

AlGunner (Score: 1): If you want one that actually does 200 miles look at one that has a published range of 300+. That should mean you actually get 200 comfortably with a bit charge left as a safety buffer. Its not recommended to take them down to 0 miles charge but I had to once when I first got mine as the 2 chargers Id planned into my journey back didnt work. I did about 3 miles with it showing a range of 0 and it doesnt seem to have done anything bad to the car, but I try to plan to have 20% left now. My car had a published range of I think it was 240 or 210 depending on the range type used. It now shows just under that and I actually get about 180 but I dont drive to be frugal. 

I average about 3p per mile over my year of ownership. Home charging is a must though. So yes it will cut your commute cost by maybe 80% based on home charging. Insurance is a bit more for me but servicing and tax is less.

1mevmuj,Low speed pull to the right - Renault Clio 2018,"So I recently bought a Clio from a dealer. When I test drove it all seemed well, and I tried to check a couple of time if there was any pulling to either side.

After purchase and a couple of drives I've noticed that at low speeds, the car pulls to the right. Not only does the car drift to the right, but the steering wheel also turns to the right a little.

It is most noticable under 30mph, and when set straight at 30mph it doesnt seem to drift. I really dont think its camber. When driving and accelerating normally its almost unnoticable, but when crawling along in traffic, it repeatedly happens and needs constant correction.

I've driven down the motorway yesterday and it seems fine at 60-70. There was a little vibration in the wheel just above 70.

\- The tyres pressures have been set correctly

\- It has new tyres on the front, and older ones on the back, but still with a lot of tread on.

\- I took the car to my trusted garage for a Health Check, for piece of mind after buying it and because I had noticed this pull.

\-- They said overall the car is in very good condition. They did do a wheel alignment, but did not find any brakes to be binding from their basic checks. New disks and pads on the front too.  
\--When I spoke to them a day later and said it still pulls they were at a loss of what the problem could be.  
\--They recommended I either take the car to another garage for a second opinion, or return it to where i purchased it.

Now I understand my rights under the consumer rights act 2015, I can ask them to attempt a repair and then ask for my money back if unsuccessful. Everything else on the car is great, and I was pleased that my local garage was so impressed with its condition.

What my concern is, is that if I return it to the garage from where I purchased it, they too may not be able to find whats wrong too, and I'll still be in the same position.

So, I'm here asking for any ideas on what could be causing this issue, so I could go back to the garage and say ""can you check X or Y as i believe that migt be the cause"". Yes not necessary, but having an idea of what the problem could be would help me know if I should reject the vehicle.

Is it something to do with Clio's in general? I know it has an anti-rollback feature on it, could that be engaging the rear brakes slightly at low speed (edit: I dont think its this as the brakes are not excessivly hot)?  
Could it be suspension related? If suspension arm or what-not, and it needs replacing, do i have to have both of them done else it will pull the other way?

1meuqx0,DPF Misconceptions - Hopefully something informative,"Wanted to make a post to clear up some misconceptions I see about how DPFs work in (modern) Diesel cars. 

For context, for the past year i‚Äôve been driving a Diesel Octavia and using a DPF regen monitor to track regen activity. I have a pretty solid grasp of how it works. 

My car regens every 200/250 miles - usually closer to 200 when lots of around town driving. 250 is more typical if i‚Äôm doing long motorway drives. 

My car *ONLY* active regens. Even on long journeys, the soot level never decreases. 

My car can FULLY regen at idle. Extra fuel is injected, it idles higher, but the DPF hits 600 degrees easily at idle. Even if i‚Äôm on the motorway, in 3rd gear at 3500rpm, the DPF temp is 600. It never goes higher. 

You don‚Äôt need to sit in 3rd gear on the motorway for the dpf to regen. My DPF regens only when it needs to - you can‚Äôt force it to. If it needs to regen it will do it while idling. You don‚Äôt need to go on a dedicated drive for it. 

On older models you did have to, sure. But for modern diesels (2013 on, for example) you really don‚Äôt need to do some crazy motorway drive to regen the dpf.

Zero DPF issues. People are massively overly worried and all the misconceptions about having to drive xxx motorway miles a week are just wrong. Mine sees a motorway maybe 2-3 times **a year**. Granted, lots of motorway miles may reduce the risk of DPF issues, but if you don't you aren't sent to the danger zone. And I'm not saying you'll be immune from DPF issues no matter how you drive - shit happens - but people are scared off unnecessarily.

However, to clarify a few points:

>My car can FULLY regen at idle.¬†

A regen can start when idle and continue if interrupted next time you drive but a regular regen is unlikely to finish from start to finish just idling.

>¬†you can‚Äôt force it to

You can. To add to the above, there's two types of regens you can initiate. A regular one and an idle one. The idle one is mostly a hail mary if all other avenues have failed. It's not as efficient and doesn't regen as well as a successful regular regen. I'm not saying a regular regen won't progress while idling but I don't think it can complete just idling. Happy to be proved wrong.

>You don‚Äôt need to go on a dedicated drive for it.

Not normally. But if you interrupt a regen too many times (by turning the engine off before it finishes) it'll throw the DPF light and refuse to do any further regens. This, AFAIK, is because you are now at risk of irreversible DPF issues. It's fully recoverable, it's a way to force you to a garage who will know how to start & complete a full regen. I normally go for a drive after the fourth or fifth time of interrupting a regen although I'm not sure what the limit is.

My own opinion (from reading comments here mostly) is that a large chunk continue driving when the DPF light comes on, not knowing that they are now not doing any active regens, and quickly the DPF gets so bad it has to be replaced. Then surprised Pikachu face.

Again, not saying all DPF problems are avoidable or the users fault. And all the above are based on VW TDI's. Fords or GM's may be more fragile.

ThatsASaabStory (Score: 5): Someone told me that the EA189 had much better thought out firmware in this regard than a lot of engines. I don't know how true that is.

What you don't know is; - 1 How can we tell the car is doing a regen until she stops the engine? There's no dashboard indication that it's doing a regen.

2- How do we stop the car? Or more specifically, if she drove, or let the car idle for longer to allow the regen process to complete. How do we know it's complete and we can stop the engine, given that there's no real easy to tell it's doing a regen in the first place."

- I can call 3rd party's insurance and see if they would be willing to handle the repairs. 

What do you suggest? 
Of course I need the car repaired, and I want to make sure it will be a non fault claim for me and the 3rd party won't back out. I want to make sure my NCD remains too. 
I have dashcam footage, lorry driver has dashcam too. 
Thanks for the help.

The fact that the lorry driver admitted fault on the spot and you have dashcam footage on both sides puts you in a strong position. üëå

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of your options:

Option 1: Go through your own insurance (with Vizion)

You choose the repairer and timing ‚Äî good for flexibility.

You pay the excess upfront (yes, annoying).

Your No Claims Discount (NCD) might be temporarily affected, but if your insurer successfully recovers everything from the other party, it gets restored and your excess is refunded.

You‚Äôre relying on your insurer to chase the third party ‚Äî which they usually will if liability is clear (and dashcam footage supports you).


Good if: you want to stay in control of who does the repair, and you're okay waiting a bit to get your excess refunded.


---

 Option 2: Go direct to the third party‚Äôs insurer

If they accept liability (which they likely will given both dashcams and admission), they‚Äôll handle everything ‚Äî no excess, no NCD impact.

They may offer a courtesy car, repairs, etc.

Can sometimes be quicker and simpler if the third party insurer is cooperative.


Good if: you want to avoid paying excess and get repairs sorted without involving your own policy at all.

Caution: if they drag their heels or play games, it could delay things ‚Äî but with dashcam footage and a driver admission, it‚Äôs unlikely unless they‚Äôre wildly incompetent.


---

 My advice?

Call the third party‚Äôs insurer first.
Explain the situation, offer to share dashcam footage, and ask if they‚Äôll take full responsibility and handle the repairs.

If they:

Say yes ‚Üí great, you avoid excess and NCD issues.

Start dragging it out or giving vague answers ‚Üí go back to Option 1 and let your insurer handle it.


Keep a log of every phone call, name, and time ‚Äî just in case things get messy.

PurpWippleM3 (Score: 1): If you've been waiting 6 weeks, maybe now is the time to start considering buying new, rather than an unknown quantity used part.

You're looking for an assembly made up of multiple individually available parts with their own part numbers, which complicates matters. I can't confirm based on any of my cross-reference data that the part number you quote is the *only* one suitable for your vehicle but I can see there are other identical looking assemblies with slightly different 'DZ' numbers which are probably suitable.

Equally, you may have more luck searching with the part number EX2Q-9F464-BA. Or you can use [parts.jaguarlandroverclassic.com](http://parts.jaguarlandroverclassic.com) to find the part numbers of each component you need and build up the assembly separately.

I know a little bit about cars but would appreciate further knowledge and information about the following cars I am considering buying plus any recommendations that you might have. 

I have a budget of around ¬£8,000 including insurance. Ideally, anything that isn‚Äôt a money pit with repairs, servicing, fuel and any ludicrous insurance.

So far, the options I‚Äôm considering are:

- 2014 Volvo V60 2.0L Diesel
- 2012 Hyundai Veloster 1.6 Turbo Petrol 
- 2016 Ford Mondeo 1.5L Diesel 
- 2016 Seat Leon 1.4L Petrol
- 2014 Mazda Mazda3 2.0L Petrol 
- 2016 Jaguar XE 2.0L Diesel (Probably not but I would love to say that I‚Äôve got a Jaaag)

Any advice, information or personal recommendations would be appreciated. Anything good looking, fairly practical and reliable is most important.

 Your Options

2014 Volvo V60 2.0 Diesel

Pros: Built like a tank, comfy, safe, and reliable if looked after.

Cons: Diesels aren‚Äôt always the cheapest for young drivers (insurance & ULEZ if you‚Äôre in/near a city). Also, big estate as a first car = parking practice required.

Verdict: Solid, but maybe a bit much for a first runabout.



---

2012 Hyundai Veloster 1.6 Turbo Petrol

Pros: Quirky, fun, decent performance. Insurance might sting a bit at 22.

Cons: Not the most common car ‚Üí parts/repairs can be pricier. Build quality not as bulletproof as the Mazda or Seat.

Verdict: Cool if you want something different, but not the most sensible choice.



---

2016 Ford Mondeo 1.5 Diesel

Pros: Comfortable cruiser, cheap to run on long journeys, loads of space.

Cons: Again, big diesel as a first car = insurance might not love you. Diesels also come with DPF headaches if you‚Äôre mostly doing short trips.

Verdict: Great motorway car, but maybe overkill for your needs.



---

2016 Seat Leon 1.4 Petrol

Pros: Smart choice ‚Äî reliable VW group engine, good balance of fun + economy, insurance-friendly compared to turbo hot hatches.

Cons: Just make sure it‚Äôs been serviced properly (timing belt intervals etc).

Verdict: One of the best all-rounders on your list for a first car.



---

2014 Mazda3 2.0 Petrol

Pros: Reliable, good-looking, fun to drive, surprisingly efficient for a 2.0 petrol. Insurance isn‚Äôt too bad for what it is.

Cons: Less common than Leons/Focuses, so fewer parts in scrapyards if anything goes wrong.

Verdict: Another excellent choice ‚Äî often overlooked but seriously solid.



---

2016 Jaguar XE 2.0 Diesel

Pros: You get to say ‚ÄúI drive a Jaaaaag‚Äù in your best Clarkson voice.

Cons: Insurance = pain. Maintenance = pain. Repairs = wallet apocalypse. As a first car, it‚Äôs like adopting a Great Dane puppy in a studio flat.

Verdict: Lovely, but unless you want to live on Pot Noodles to keep it running, avoid.

My picks for you

Seat Leon 1.4 Petrol ‚Äì sensible, reliable, stylish, not boring.

Mazda3 2.0 Petrol ‚Äì underrated gem, reliable, a bit sporty without the crazy insurance.


Both tick your boxes: good-looking, practical, not a money pit.

Extra tips:

Get insurance quotes before buying ‚Äî sometimes the car you think is cheaper isn‚Äôt.

Budget ¬£500‚Äì¬£1k from your ¬£8k for insurance, tax, and first-year maintenance (tyres, service, etc).

Don‚Äôt rule out a Honda Civic 1.8 Petrol or a Toyota Auris/Corolla 1.6 Petrol ‚Äî boring reputation, but bulletproof and cheap to run.

1meqtb0,First time parent needing a new car,"Hi all, my girlfriend and I are soon to be first time parents (had the 20 week scan on Wednesday) and I've been thinking more and more that I need to change cars.

I currently have a 2015 hyundai i10. It's served me well and I love the car, but I feel like it's too small for a family car. The boot space is very limited and the other half thinks it's a bit low down to the ground. 

I have no knowledge of cars so I'm hoping to get some suggestions for a reliable car with decent boot space for baby stuff that isn't going to cost an arm and a leg to buy and maintain. It would need air conditioning too. We would prefer an automatic and a higher up car, but that's not a necessity.

Financially, we're not in a position to buy brand new and would be planning to part exchange the hyundai and pay the rest off monthly. 

Thank you for any advice in advance.

1meqeyy,Cost of Hiring a car in the UK and driving it to France,"I am looking at hiring a car in the UK (Bristol) to drive to France for my holiday - basically so I have a more room and more comfortable drive for the long distance.

Does anyone know of the best way to do this or maybe companies that allow this without a ridiculous surcharge? 

Since I started researching this I have discovered that  all of the major car hire companies I have looked at either won't allow it or add a huge surcharge. 

Here are some examples of surcharges:

Alamo: ¬£325, 
Drivalia ¬£240 (1000mile limit + 50p per mile after), 
Avis - not allowed, 
Enterprise - ¬£300, 
Dollar - not allowed, 
Budget - not allowed, 
National - ¬£325, 
Europcar - not allowed, 
and Hertz - not allowed.

Is there a cleverer way to do this? e.g. drive the UK leg in my own car and hire in France? Or a specialist company out there that does this?  

Other useful info:
Looking to spend less than ¬£500 for a 10 day hire (this is the cheapest I have found so far with a survharge). 
Want to hire a standard or large sized car.

I know Kwik Fit wasn‚Äôt a wise choice however one of my existing tyres was damaged and I wanted it changed asap and my usual independent tyre place was closed. 

They initially messed the tyres up as they were balanced incorrectly with excess weights all over the wheels. I had to return to the garage the following day where the person who rebalanced all 4 wheels slated the initial fitter.

They‚Äôve just contacted me 20 minutes after I dropped the car off to advise that the bead on one of my tyres is damaged and they wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable refitting the tyre to the wheel. 
They‚Äôve said that the missing chunk of tyre is nowhere to be seen and it was likely damaged during fitting - I know they could just be saying this - but I‚Äôve used them many times before without issue and I trust them.
