It’s been going through coolant for 3-4 months. It doesn’t leak coolant. It must be burning it. It happens real slow unless I go in the highway. Then it goes through like 1/2gallon every 2 hours. Otherwise it’s really slow and I too up once a week. 1/4 gallon. 
I did an exhaust gas test from the radiator and the fluid didn’t change color. A mechanic at work suggested doing the test at 4-5k rpm in case it’s a hairline crack in the head or block. I didn’t do it. 

It overheated last night at 340*F. I pulled over when I noticed the needle buried on hot. 

The coolant was very low and when I went to start it after topping it off, it acted like the battery was low. It cranked slow. 

I thought maybe it was mid seizing so I called a tow. 

I did a dry compression test and got 

Cyl4 135
Cyl3 150
Cyl2 138
Cyl 1 168

I took the valve cover off and it was milky foam. 

I drained the oil and it was normal with no water or foam in it. 

I was thinking head gasket until the compression numbers which are okay but not great and no water in the oil pan. 

Could there be cracks in the water jackets of the head allowing water to stay within the head but not go in the block?

Appx 175,000 miles - car has lived in the Southeast for 4 years but previous owner was in the northeast from ‘18-‘21

Seeking rear wheel hub replacement advice.

My local shop diagnosed a need to replace both rear hub/bearing assemblies and quoted a high enough price that I was willing to do the work myself. I’ve worked on this car and previous vehicles to a great extent, including replacing a worn hub on my old Toyota Highlander. I have not replaced the famed Subaru rear hub but figured it couldn’t be that technically different from other vehicles. 

At this point I’m suck, with the vehicle on stands until the right rear hub can be replaced. I have an appointment two weeks out for my local shop to replace the left rear hub, but the vehicle can’t move or be towed until the right rear wheel is remounted. 

What are my best options? Is it possible to try and cut the hub (diamond sawzall blade?) while it is still in the knuckle and hammer or rotate using that cut? Is there a complete knuckle and hub assembly available for a Subaru like there are for other vehicles? (If so I can’t find one)

Attempts to remove so far:
- Some gentle hammer knocking on the hub to loosen any corrosion
- a whole can of PB Blaster penetrating oil (eventually)
- Astro Tools The Original Impact Rated Hub Removal Bolt Kit - these bolts stripped and did not provide the “racking” they intended (this may be due to the shape of the knuckle and lack of backing to push against
- Rented 5# hammer puller - this eventually pulled the hub from the bearing body (axle nut was still on)
- Heat heat and more heat - various heating attempts on knuckle and on bearing combined with other listed methods
- Air hammer - attempts to rotate the hub in its frame to no avail
- knocking from the back, regular and air hammer - reinstalled the hub mounting screws loosely to attempt to knock from the back
- good old sledge hammer - the 4# fiberglass hammer now has a bent handle

Any advice or direction is greatly appreciated!

1nadts7,What's my problem,"So a couple weeks ago my car's AC stopped working and a bit later the check engine light came on. The code for it was p0128 and I did a bit of digging on my car.

So I removed the park and saw corrosion on it so I replaced it and cleared the code. Everything was working fine after I turned it back on and for the following day. I was returning back from running errands and the AC stopped working again on the car. No check engine light has come back on, I have inspected the AC clutch and I can spin it with my hand.

1nadlcf,Changing Engine Oil Woes,"This is a 2019 Kia Niro hybrid with a 1.6L engine. I set about to change engine oil with an oil extractor, after which I was going to change the filter. First problem was I didn't get the car up on the Rhino ramps first. Had I done this I wouldn't be posting. One issue is the oil extractor only got about 2.6L of the 3.8L of oil capacity out of the engine sump, and then it lost suction. Can't get the rest out. So I have a car with about 25% of it's oil capacity sitting on flat ground and I am loathe to pour all the old oil back in and start over (eventhough I guess had I done that I would be a good ways towards finished by now.) Every time I change the oil in this car the oil comes out looking exactly like the brand new oil I put into it; in other words very clean. So the options I am contemplating besides just pouring all the old oil back in, putting the car up on the ramps, and draining and changing it conventionally are

1. Putting in 2.6L of fresh oil, calling it good and changing the oil and filter via the normal procedure in 2500 miles, instead of the 7500 recommended in the manual. This would give the current oil filter 10K miles before being changed; and put 2500 miles on it with a 75% blend of fresh oil and 25% of oil that has 7500 miles on it.

2. Starting the car and hope I can get it up on the ramps on purely battery power before the engine kicks on.

What is the actual probability of any sort of damage from executing one of the above the options, and which would be less risky? I would think option 1 is less risky. 

I also have a GMC Sierra 5.8L engine where the oil interval is 7.5-10K miles. This Niro is a hybrid, so some percentage of those 7.5K miles are done on battery power. I drive very conservatively so I'd say 10-15% of the driving miles the engine is actually off. How bad can option 1 really be?

Hi everyone, I’ve been going through hell the last two days trying to fix my brakes.

My buddy and I replaced all rotors and pads yesterday on my 2015 Audi S5 B8.5 coupe. Everything went smoothly and we continued to change the fluid. While flushing the brakes (manual 2 man pump method), we let the reservoir get too low and air was introduced to the system. We didn’t think this would be a huge problem as we could just flush it out, boy were we wrong.

After flushing the air out of all 4 lines, I had practically no brake power. Research online led me to believe there is now air trapped in the ABS pump, Gemini 2.5 agrees. Anyways, we tried for about 2 hours to get the air out to no avail. I used the VCDS to try and bleed the ABS pump, but could not find any documentation on how to do it.

Got a tow this morning and took it to Firestone, where they bled my brakes 3 separate times. They work now, but they’re WAYYY less sensitive than they were before. For comparison, I would barely tap the brakes and would practically come to a complete stop damn near any speed. I couldn’t even get close to pushing the pedal all the way down. Now, however, I can. They told me if I want to make them more sensitive, to take the car to a dealer or European car shop. Obviously I don’t want to do this if I can avoid it ($$$).

I’m wondering if anyone here knows how to do the VCDS guided ABS pump bleed for a 2015 Audi S5. Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated.

My wife was driving home and out of nowhere we had what sounded like multiple misfires and the car stopped running and idling really rough. She immediately stopped and it just so happened to be right in front of a mechanic (Tire) shop. I met her there and talked with the mechanic, we ended up leaving the car there so the mechanic could look at it the next day. He called me, said it's something going on with Cylinder 7, I had him do a compression test as it had spark and fuel and here's what he got: 

Cylinder 6 - 210 PSI   

Cylinder 7 - 0 PSI  

Cylinder  8 - 210 PSI 

After he told me that, he said sorry man that sucks and I ended up needing to get it towed to my house.

Turn signals don't work, no clicking is heard, nor blinking inside or outside car when I try to activate the turn signals in either direction, Fuse is fine and hazard lights work fine as well and even make the usual clicking noise inside the car.

Brake lights, regular red tail lights, headlights and highbeams are fine.

I don't have a relay tester to test the relays and I can't find much in the way of documentation about the relays to begin to know which one to test anyway.

The main thing is the fuel in the tank. Is it safe to start with a new battery? I've heard modern cars and modern fuel doesn't really break down for years so it should be fine, but I'm not sure if an 02 ES300 qualifies as modern either.

1.  Do I need to flush the high and low side hoses and the condenser before adding the new components,  or not do any flush?

2.  My compressor came with 3oz of pag oil, and needs an additional 5.5oz.  Do I add all of it to the compressor, or split it and put some in the accumulator,  or it doesn't matter?

1na5t1j,Oil level looks above max even after sitting 3 days. Dipstick tube residue or actual overfill?,"I might be overthinking this, but I want to be sure before I drive with overfilled oil and damage the engine.

> * **Car:** 2008 Audi S4 Sedan (manual)
> * **Oil:** Liqui Moly 2332 Leichtlauf High Tech 5W-40

Here’s the situation:

* The oil level was originally very low, way under the `LOW` mark.
* I was topping it straight from a `5L ≈ 1.3 gal ≈ 5.3 qt` jug off little by little, judging the quantity by feel, and checking the dipstick between every pour. 
* It was going too slow, so I did one pour that was a bit longer than the others. I checked the dipstick and believed I might have overdone it.
* I checked the dipstick multiple times the same day → same reading every time.
* Then I let the car sit **3 full days** (not moved, not started, flat ground) so any oil in the **dipstick tube** could drain back down.
* Re-checked today → see photos are attached.

On the dipstick itself, the oil film sits within the markings, near the `MIN` line. But when I blot it on a paper towel, the stain always spreads much higher than `FULL`. That’s what has me paranoid about overfill.

**Question:**  
Is the paper towel just misleading (smearing/wicking), or could this actually be overfilled? I don’t want to run it if it’s truly above max.

History:

\- Originally a manual 67 mustang with original inline 6 in it that I drove as a daily for a while.

\- Bought a 68 302 block from one of my coworkers, stripped it down, took it to a machine shop where they cleaned it up, installed new pistons and a ""mild cam"", not a stock cam on a 302. Sadly I was young and dumb and didn't think to identify which cam was put into the block before I built it.

\-Built it from there my self in a storage unit back in 2019-2021 ish, finished the final details here in the last year 2024-2025 ish.

Problem:

Trying to start it for the first time with my Dad who has worked on multiple 67' mustangs himself, got it to start briefly but he had me shut it off as it was leaking a little bit. Struggled to get it started again but finally got it started after a few days and was still leaking and he had me turn it off again. now after about a month after trying to start it I am at my wits end.

I have:

\- verified that the distributer is at the appropriate setting and not 180 degrees off.

\-verified current from the coil to the distributer.

\-verified a clean and new distributer.

\- verified that current flows through each wire to each spark plug.

\-verified that the wires are in the correct firing order.

\- Set the timing as close as possible to TDC and adjusted slowly to find better timing as the engine was cranked.

\-verified the battery is working properly at Oreilly's as well as checking voltage before each start is around 12.8 volts.

\- Purchased and installed 8 new spark plugs, one for each piston.

\- Balanced the fuel screws on the 4 barrel carb to 1.5 turns.

\- Adjusted the choke so that it is open about 1/8"" inch on cold start.

\- Installed a shim to make sure the starter engages at the appropriate depth.

\- verified there is no rubbing and grinding on the starter gears or fly wheel.

\- tried using engine starter fluid to kickstart the engine.

After trying all of these things all I have gotten so far is some backfire out the tail pipe and a fuel rumbles of cylinders barely trying to fire, nothing even close to starting. The engine turns over great but just cant get the cylinders to begin firing. Any ideas are welcome. If I cant figure something out within the next few weeks im afraid I will have to start breaking it down and start from the bottom up, this time building back a little faster than 6 years...",1,1757180439.0,7,MechanicAdvice,1757273591,2025-09-06 17:40:39,2025-09-07 19:33:11,"woohooguy (Score: 2): If it wont run with constant blasts carb cleaner or starter fluid, there is still something wrong in the timing or ignition.

If it is, you know your mechanical timing (IE, the chain) is proper and the valves are opening and shutting when they should and sealing well, and that piston rings are sealing properly too.

I need advice on how to handle a situation with a local shop.  I have a 2013 F150 heavy half.  It has 250k miles and I brought it into a local shop because I would hear a growling noise when I put the truck into 4WH or 4WL.  The growl was proportionate to the speed of the wheels.  The was no noise or issues when in 2WH. 
Upfront they charged me a $200 fee for diagnosis, which I understand is a fair common practice.  They reported back that the transfer case needed to be replaced and it would cost $1400 to install a used unit with 150k on it.  The price was acceptable but right at the limit of what I wanted to spend to get rid of a noise.  I could live without 4WD all together so getting this fixed was optional. 

They put in another tcase, and low and below the growling noise is still there.  I only noticed this after they said it was good to go and I had paid the $1600 (diagnostic & tcase).  I brought it back and showed them there was still an issue.  They assumed the tcase that was just installed was bad so they ordered another and put it in.  At this point they also proactively (without talking to me first) put in a IWE hub on the front passenger side at no cost.  This tells me that they were questioning their own diagnostic.  At this point they asked me to come drive it to see what I thought. 

I drove the truck and the noise was still there, but not as loud.  It also sounds a little more like a scraping, not just a growl.  And now, the noise is there all the time, even in 2wd.  They now want to replace all the components associated with the IWE system, including solenoids, hoses, and the other driver side hub assembly.  They just quoted me $2650 and I told them not to touch it and I will call them back.  

As I stated above, I would never have considered putting this kind of money into the truck.  I bought it for $5k and I could live with 2WD only.  I have spent $1600 thus far and the truck is less functional when I brought it in.  I feel they are on the hook since I paid them to do a diagnostic to prevent this exact thing from happening.

1na2v8q,Electric Gremlins ‘05 Pontiac GP,"
2005 Pontiac Grand Prix Base - 153k mi.

We have a 2005 Grand Prix that we’ve had since 2005. Earlier this year I replaced the original alternator  with a Carquest reman. The reman alternator failed spectacularly in less than a month and it was putting out around 19v. I assume the voltage regulator failed on it. The strong smell of an “electrical fire” prompted me to investigate.

Swapped it out with another reman. unit. Since then I’ve been having weird electric issues. The reverse lights now flash on then off when put into reverse, they won’t stay on in reverse or when using the key fob to unlock the doors. I checked all bulbs and the circuit from the trunk up to the BCM with a multimeter. The circuit is fine and briefly supplies the correct voltage when the shifter goes into reverse. I probed the BCM and got the same result. The range selector was my first thought but doesn’t seem to be the issue.

There’s also P0480. Cooling fan 1 doesn’t work most of the time. I’ve watched live data on my OBD reader and 7/10 times the fan won’t kick on when the engine reaches the right temp. The times it does kick on is completely random. Relays are good. Tested the fans with 12v power and they both work. For now leaving the AC button pressed in the car keeps fan 1 running. 

Then there’s the Service Engine Soon on the DIC (not a typical CEL). I haven’t seen this alert in the 20 years we’ve owned the car. It’s a BCM code that none of my code readers can pull so I have no clue what it indicates. Again didn’t happen until after the alternator failed.

At first I treated them as separate issues but now I’m wondering if the over voltage from the alternator may have damaged the BCM? The only other thing that comes to mind is a bad ground somewhere but considering these issues didn’t start until the alternator failed I’m hesitant to think it’s a coincidence.

I could take it somewhere that has a tech 2 or similar scanner to pull the BCM code, but I figured in the mean time I’d see if anyone here has seen anything like this. Especially with a W body 3800.",1,1757173613.0,5,MechanicAdvice,1757273591,2025-09-06 15:46:53,2025-09-07 19:33:11,"waynep712222 (Score: 1): lets start with this test first... https://i.imgur.com/SnzhDh0.jpg

Check your brake fluid reservoir (its probably low), and while in park engine off pump the brakes while somebody looks for fluid coming out.  If its empty, refill it a little bit.

Position the jack under the centre of the front cross member - its structural on your car so its OK- just put a cloth or something between the jack and it to prevent scratches and damage. 

When you have the jack in the centre, before actually lifting, Position it so that it almost sideways under the front with the handle poking in the direction you need the front to go. Its handy to have an assistant too. 

Basically you want to just take the weight of the vehicle, so that the jack is holding the car, then gently pull/push both together, the plyboard will let the wheels roll whereas the jack will just dig in as it is. 

Its piss easy once you've done it but you need to make sure the car doesn't slip so do it gently, usually one pulls the jack when the other just keeps a push to prevent them moving at different rates.

The power steering pump died on a long trip. Got it replaced by a shop in the area. 

They didn't re-install the reservoir properly and nicked the seal. Realized when driving and all the fluid leaked out that the new pump also failed due to running out of fluid. 

Replaced with a new pump, o ring and reservoir and bled the system. 

Since then, it has a whine. Figured the pump I had was a dud, so replaced it with a used pump from the local wrecking yard. It whines just the same. 

Replaced it with a second used pump, same thing. So 3 pumps are now whining the same way. 

I have got under and inspected for leaks. I don't see any. Fluid level remains the same. 

However, it appears there are really tiny bubbles in the fluid, which I believe are the cause for the whine.

Intermittent camshaft sensor signal. Since it sounded like a need for a new sensor, I took it on DIY. A giant p.i.a., but I went OEM on the sensor and assumed it would be good. 

It was. For two trips.

After researching I took many steps to fix this. Some actions not directly related but that could effect the issue. 

Replaced:
Sensor with OEM replacement
Pigtail connection for sensor
Battery
Battery terminals
Ground straps for battery
Alternator 
Dead wire in the alternator pigtail 

The only thing I'm not 100% I did the ""right"" way was the alternator pigtail. For some reason getting an alternator pigtail for my van same day in person is difficult, and the replacements I can order that aren't eBay sketchy ones are $40...

So I spliced a wire into the pigtail of the alternator and ran it directly thru to the PCM connector and spliced it in there. I'm 1000% sure I did it in the right location and the butt connectors are fully on the wires etc etc etc. 

I am having trouble believing that could still be the issue, but just in case..... I tried looking for the pin sizes to replace them, and pin the wire directly into the connections.... I can't not find that info ANYWHERE even wth connectors that say ""honda odyssey oem equivalent"" don't list the dimensions of the pins. Or even sell the pins individually 😣

This is an interference engine.

There is an extremely high likelihood that the valves are bent.

You could remove the valvetrain from the top so that all the valves should all be closed.  Then look to see if all the valves have fully lifted/do a leakdown test.

[This](https://imgur.com/a/F25CfbC) shaft I'm pointing at (intake rockers) and the one under it (exhaust rockers).  Obviously you would have to do this on both heads.

dxrey65 (Score: 1): I'd usually pull the valve covers (and sometimes the cams) and see if all the valves are sitting at the same height. If one or more looks to be sitting lower, then pull spark plugs and take a peak in the combustion chambers with a borescope to see the valves and look for witness marks on the piston faces, or do a leakdown test. If I were considering replacing an engine I'd probably want to take a good look at things anyway to help the decision one way or another.

In my experience, maybe 50% of interference engines I've looked at have bent valves when the belt breaks. It depends on exactly how it breaks and what position and speed the pistons are at; when the belt goes the valves \*can\* snap shut and out of the way, as the belt is the only thing that holds them open.

I'm trying to interpret this report. From what they said, it seems the misalignment wasn’t severe enough to warrant immediate attention, so I'm questioning whether I truly needed the realignment. I paid about $82 for this service, and I'm wondering if I might have been overcharged or if this was a necessary expense.

You realistically can get away with up to 7500 miles before changing, but it's not like the engine will grenade itself if you go past these intervals, it just adds more wear and may result in your car not lasting as it could if you did stay consistent with oil changes.

The manager was angry with us for inquiring, but we asked up the food chain and corporate actually forced them to give us money back.  Haven’t gone back since).

So my check engine light went on, and also my brake light went out coincidentally.  Since I had recalls, I decided to bring it to Kia.  They later gave me a call quoting the issues at $1,800.  Basically in addition to oil change and the light, they noted issues including my rear brake pad/rotors needing replacement, brake fluid exchange, cooling system drain/refill, and spark plug replacement.  I honestly agreed because it all seemed fair.  And my brakes did look worn.  I however asked them “but what was my check engine light for?” And they said “oh that’s nothing.  It just goes on after some time.”  I didn’t really buy it so I pressed the issue, and they reiterated it was on for nothing.  I figured it was fine, so I just said yes and got it back last week.

Now exactly one week later I’ve been driving it, for like 200-300 miles and just noticed the engine light went back on.  Annoyed that this was similar to my last venture to Kia (albeit 5ish years ago) I remember my dad had a “blue driver” which gives error codes and used that myself, which explained the issue to be “O2 Sensor Heater - Heater Control Circuit (Bank 1 / Sensor 2)”

The part I find “fishy” is that they adamantly told me the check engine just goes on after a while.  But that doesn’t sound right.  And I heard that it can go off if you disconnect/reconnect the battery (or something like that) and if the issue persists it will go back on after a couple hundred miles.

I’m wondering if I’m getting cheated again somehow, and they did this for some reason to get me to come back.  Any thoughts?  I’m prepared to be 100% wrong on this as I’m aware I have a lack of knowledge.

The mileage is absolutely TERRIBLE. My job is roughly a mile and a half away from my home, so being generous, let’s say 4 miles to and from work. I never drive anywhere else unless I go to school which is 6 miles to and from. Let’s say 32 miles for the entire week. Yet somehow just with this I’m already down to half a tank every week. Just to put in gas every week is 30-40 dollars. My dad doesn’t believe me and I never even have the A/C on or have it in idle. Is this seriously normal?? I feel like I seem like such a brat complaining about my car but it’s true when I’m the one paying for my gas so consistently. 

Another problem I’d like to note is the fact my gas inconsistently displays my gas. If I fill up my tank and drive around, of course it’ll go down. But when it comes to me continuing to drive, suddenly I’m the luckiest person in the world because suddenly I have a full tank again. Give it a couple minutes and then suddenly I’ve gone down even MORE in gas, give it a couple more minutes once again and boom, I’ve been blessed by the gasoline fairies for apparently filling my tank. My dad also says this isn’t an issue!

I have finished assembling everything, pouring new oil & coolant and am ready to start the engine (and burping the cooling system with a funnel).

The first thing I'm going to do is to lubricate the cam lobes and lifters manually and pouring some oil inside the cylinders through spark plug holes. Then, I will crank the engine by the starter alone until the oil warning light goes off and pressure builds inside the oil channels (oil priming). 

Now, it is time to break in the new parts (valves, camshaft, lifters, etc).

Solid lifter, SOHC configuration. (I have also checked the valve shims and everything is within spec). Since I bought a complete cylinder head, they had already lapped the valves at the factory and it was ready to go on the car.

**Now my question is:**

How should I break in the new parts after the first start? Should I let the car idle for a while then increasing RPM and vary it (between 2000 - 3000)? Should I avoid driving the car until I do the break-in process? Am I allowed to drive the car after the first start with the new parts?

Also check the coil for proper output and cross firing since 4 and 6 are beside each other on the coil pack. Use this type of spark tester as you can increase and decrease the gap to check the spark strength, also while you are checking the coils output give it a little mist of water from a spray bottle and look for arcing along the outside of the coil, sometimes micro cracks will develop and let it arc outside or to another terminal.

It's not a huge job to replace this at home. You'll need to jack it up on one side and put it on jackstands, and then use your jack under the lower control arm. You need to slightly compress the suspension so the coil spring won't fight you as hard. This also helps avoid anything over extending when you undo the upper control arm. You may need to vary the height of the spindle/upright (that's the term for the thing the wheel attaches to, that the upper control arm is bolted to at the top) using the jack to get the new part to line up. Once you have everything lined up and the bolts are in, jack up the lower control arm to compress the suspension as much as you can before it starts to lift off the jackstands. The bushings in the control arms aren't meant to rotate too far, and they need to be bolted in place with the suspension as close to the normal ride height as possible. That should pretty much cover it I think. I'm not sure if you'll need an alignment after this

I have to jump start it in order for it to turn on. On the road, it drives like normal nothing wrong. I went to autozone so they can run tests and they said my battery was good the only code that popped up was U3006-16. I recently got all new tires about 3 days ago and right after that is when it started happening. Before that my car was fine the only thing messing up was my CarPlay it would act like if it was possessed and just click random buttons. When I try to turn on the car it gives me a bunch of errors but then they go away when I jump start it. The only one that stays is the low tire pressure, but i have recalibrated it since I have gotten news tires but it keeps coming back. The other thing that’s happening is when I would break at a red light or stop sign it would originally automatically turn the car off and when I take my foot off the brake it would turn back on, well it won’t do that anymore it tells me auto-idle unavailable ever since my car has started sputtering. Does anyone know what this could be? Does it have something to do with my new tires? Any advice would be extremely helpful. Thank you!

I have a squeaking noise coming from I believe the rear of my vehicle. Attached video shows the underside as I drive backwards then forwards. Squeak is loudest at low speed and only occurs when the vehicle moves.

For a long time I've been an outsider to the industry, hell I started wrenching way later than most people and I was never raised in a mechanical family. But ever since I started- I've found it to be a interesting career path. So far I'm about 3 years in with no professional education and I run the general service department at a local independent shop. I can do all the basic lube tech shit, and am somewhat competent at brakes and basic suspension work, and I occaisionally even do some decent HVAC diag and sell a lot of work. However- I feel like I'm hitting a horrible skills plateau. 

I don't know what the advanced tools do or even how to use them- when I walk on tool trucks- half the shit just sounds like gibberish to me ""Variable crank stud puller kit- $300?"" I've tried reading ASE study guides to improve my skills, but trying to READ about Automotive feels like trying to learn how to cook by listening to the food- it's simply incompatible with the actual experience of hands-on. YouTube Videos are a great help but only with absolute guppy beginner knowledge or very specific niche tasks, and UTI is $50,000 and routinely churns out complete morons. And then half the time you learn something from one Tech mentor only to be contradicted by another tech about it later and learn that you learned some bad advice.

Appx 175,000 miles - car has lived in the Southeast for 4 years but previous owner was in the northeast from ‘18-‘21

Seeking rear wheel hub replacement advice.

My local shop diagnosed a need to replace both rear hub/bearing assemblies and quoted a high enough price that I was willing to do the work myself. I’ve worked on this car and previous vehicles to a great extent, including replacing a worn hub on my old Toyota Highlander. I have not replaced the famed Subaru rear hub but figured it couldn’t be that technically different from other vehicles. 

At this point I’m suck, with the vehicle on stands until the right rear hub can be replaced. I have an appointment two weeks out for my local shop to replace the left rear hub, but the vehicle can’t move or be towed until the right rear wheel is remounted. 

What are my best options? Is it possible to try and cut the hub (diamond sawzall blade?) while it is still in the knuckle and hammer or rotate using that cut? Is there a complete knuckle and hub assembly available for a Subaru like there are for other vehicles? (If so I can’t find one)

Attempts to remove so far:
- Some gentle hammer knocking on the hub to loosen any rust
- a whole can of PB Blaster penetrating oil (eventually)
- Astro Tools The Original Impact Rated Hub Removal Bolt Kit - these bolts stripped and did not provide the “racking” they intended (this may be due to the shape of the knuckle and lack of backing to push against
- Rented 5# hammer puller - this eventually pulled the hub from the bearing body (axle nut was still on)
- Heat heat and more heat - various heating attempts on knuckle and on bearing combined with other listed methods
- Air hammer - attempts to rotate the hub in its frame to no avail
- knocking from the back, regular and air hammer - reinstalled the hub mounting screws loosely to attempt to knock from the back
- good old sledge hammer - the 4# fiberglass hammer now has a bent handle

Any advice or direction is greatly appreciated!

Last year we had issues with the car seemingly under powered and a P0299 code. It was recommended to replace the turbo because of known failures so that's what I did. I replaced it myself and triple checked everything. Unfortunately we're still dealing with the code and the car is currently under powered. If the code goes away it will return if Cruise is used or when RPM rises fast under acceleration.


1. I looked for any possible air leaks and found none on the lines, or intercooler 

2. I replaced the filter regardless and no change

3. The pan is leaking and will be fixed soon

4. I removed the Waste Gate Actuator but it seems to function correctly. I pulled it open and put my finger over the inlet to keep in air pressure and it stayed open until I released it. If I pull and close it I can feel a puff of air.

5. Her valve cover started leaking last year before the code and the vehicle was run low on oil when she was out of town. I found no sign of metal in the remaining oil, but I noticed sludgy oil in the dipstick tube and under the valve cover in a couple channels that I had cleaned out. This was before the Turbo swap

6. I noticed a tiny bit of oil around the oil supply lin for the turbo but nothing substantial.

7. All sensors are plugged in that's all I know. I'm unsure how to diagnose.

1na9lfd,Cylinder 3 Misfire after Washing Truck (Ram 1500 with 5.7 Hemi),"Yesterday I washed my 2019 Ram 1500 Laramie (5.7 Hemi) after it inadvertently got covered in sawdust. I drove the truck before cleaning it and it was completely fine. I used a lot of water to remove the sawdust, but nothing extreme and not directly to the engine bay (hood was closed).

I went to start it up to go somewhere and it was rough idling and I could feel a serious vibration/shaking just sitting in my driveway. It felt like an engine mount just magically disappeared and the engine was unsecured. I drove it down the road and the check light would flash and go out. I also noticed it would Rev higher (I assume to try and get to speed with a misfiring cylinder). I took it home and sat it for the night.

Today the check engine light persisted instead of flashing. I bought a code reader and it read ""cyl 3 misfire (P0303)"". I tried to reseat the connector for that cylinder as best I could, but it's stuck under the wiring harness. Now, if I am correct and cylinder 3 is second on the right when looking at the engine, that connector is right under the windshield where water certainly could have run down onto it. I don't want to break the connector or wires going into it, so I stopped messing with it.

I cleared the codes, and now the check engine light is gone, but the rough idling persists. I noticed when I Rev the engine to around 1100 RPM, the idling is smooth, but as soon as I let my foot off of the gas it comes back again. I drove it 50ft and the check again light is back on.

I swapped the coil pack with another cylinder, and the problem is still persisting in cylinder 3.

At some point between figuring out the fuse taps and now, two things happened: 

a) the wire that was meant to be connected to an always-on fuse turned out to have a bad crimp, and disconnected


b) my battery completely drained. I know it was fine at least just before I started the grounding process, and most likely during some of that too, as that's the last time I was using the multimeter and it was showing a healthy voltage. 

I'm thinking that when the wire came loose, something must have shorted the battery to ground and drained the battery super quick.

main questions: 

a) how fucked is my battery, and what should be my next steps to revive it? Do I need a trickle charger?

b) is there anything I need to particularly watch for to make sure this doesn't happen again? That is, can you think of any alternative theories to it being the cable that came loose?

BitSorcerer (Score: 2): If your car is running rough, like shaking rough, it’s more than likely the timing.  

It’s also not good to run it with the timing off if you have a zero clearance engine.  The pistons that move up and down, will be hitting the valves that are also moving up and down.  If they are not in sync, they smash into each other at the speed of light.  

This means if you continue to run it like this, if not already, your valves will bend slightly, so they’ll never fully close.  They need to close to build up a little compression.  

I’m not sure I would take it back to the same shop but if you do, ask them to take out each spark plug, 1 at a time (and put it back in after checking lol), and check the engines compression.  The engine will have to be at “dead center” so all the valves should be closed, and then they can check for compression.  

If anything is leaking, I would ask them to cover a new engine (head and a new block) and then take that to another mechanic lol

I’m the slightest chance that’s it’s a spark plug, and since you shouldn’t be driving that car in that condition, go to your local mechanic shop and buy a deep socket and a ratchet for your spark plugs and also buy a spark plug tester.  Buy the better tester that connects to both your spark plug and the wire that was attached to your spark plug.  Before testing, just verify the spark is tightened up / snug.  

The test tool you bought will flicker if there is electricity (car has to be running sadly but hook it up before starting your car) If it’s not flickering on one, or one of them is showing no light, or the light is very very dim in comparison to the others, you need to follow the wire back to the ignition coil pack and replace it. 

If this is not a zero clearance engine, you may be in luck that it’s just misfiring due to either the timing or spark plug issue.  If it is a 0 clearance engine, any amount of time that you have it on and running in this condition, will only increase the likelihood of bent valves.

I went through this a few years ago (rebuilt the head due to the smashing and valves being bent)."

But as to answer your question, touch the brakes only if you know what you are doing. If this is your first time triple check everything you do and do only one side per axle per time, watch different mechanics doing brake maintenance like 'the car care nut' on youtube.

Always use jack stands with the floor jack. The best practice is to lift one axle at the same time into air by positioning jack stands under control arm rear bushing(look it up if you dont know which one it is) and lower the car softly onto the stand with the floor jack, then do the same on other side of the axle. This way you can look up other side for guidance if you forget which way something went back in.

They did diagnostics for $140. Told me the alternator was fine and to send it to the Hyundai dealership because they suspected a computer problem. Hyundai told me the computer is fine, the alternator is failing to charge the battery. They want to replace it with an oem part. Now, I understand that time is money. And I’m not expecting a labor refund for the alternator installation. But is it reasonable to ask for some kind of compensation for the diagnostics?

He owns a vet clinic and bought this truck to use for feeding/delivering. With that said some accessories needed to be installed, he decided to install himself and drilled right through the main wire harness. The exact location that he damaged is directly underneath the passenger floorboard, he was drilling through the plastic cap on the floor to run accessory wires through. Now, after looking at it I assumed I could reconnect the wires, check fuses and relays, perform a battery reset and move on, BUT there are 3 large black wires in that harness, they contain one solid copper wire in the core, and aluminum jacket wires in the outer part of the wire casing separated by an insulated layer. The inner core (thick copper wire) reads as 9v positive and the aluminum jacket wires read as ground. I assumed these wires were for the backup camera system, but I may be wrong. Does anyone know the purpose of those wires? And would this damage cause internal damage to the TIPM? After repairing all wires except for the 3 large black wires the truck will crank but not start, and the fuel gauge reads empty. After searching for a fuel pump relay/fuse and not finding anything I concluded that the fuel pump’s circuit is protected internally by the TIPM, and I can only assume that shorting all those wires to ground when they were drilled through, damaged the TIPM cutting off signal from the fuel pump. Is my thought process correct? Is there anything I’m missing? Open for discussion, I am trying to determine whether or not to continue this repair or recommend the dreaded “stealership”.

1n9o3b2,"thinking about starting a career in the automotive industry, any advice?","i am 19 and i was looking into starting a career in this field since cars have been something i have been passionate about since i was a toddler.

i have basic experience doing oil changes as well as other basic service/repairs that i have had to do while owning several 20+ year old trucks. i wouldnt consider myself an expert by any means, but i am at least somewhat knowledgeable about certain aspects and how they would work. 

there are openings at dealerships near me for lube technicians, after looking into it a little bit this seems like it would (possibly) be the correct start to later having a career in the industry. however i am unsure.

my dad owns a shop that works on v-twin motorcycles and i have helped him several times work on bikes (i know its not the same as cars/trucks but it gave me an idea and some insight in how flat rate vs. hourly works and how shops are typically run.)

i dont want to get in over my head into a career that has a chance of possibly not working out for me, so i have a couple of questions to do with it. i have researched into it a good bit, but i figured it would be best to ask people who really work in the field for some insight into it, i appreciate any advice.

1. how is the job market for techs at this time? is there a high demand or is the market saturated?

2. how quickly does someone progress in the career? i know like all careers it differs from shop to shop and person to person, but from your own experiences, how fast were you able to progress from where you started to where you are now?

3. if i were to attempt this, where would be the best place to start? should i start as a lube tech and learn my way up from there? should i take classes at a community college/trade school? (my local CC offers free/discounted auto tech classes with their own designated campus for automotive classes) or should i do a combination of both?

4. do you do flat rate or hourly, and, if you have done both, which do you prefer? 

5. if i do go into the industry, what specific part of it should i go into? diesel mechanic, fleet mechanic, auto mechanic (at a dealer or independent shop?) etc. i have a friend who is my age who is an apprentice diesel mechanic and he loves it.

6. do you have any general advice for first starting out if i take the lube tech position? (i promise i wont torque the oil drain plugs to 74837 lb/ft lol) 

7. is this a rewarding career to jump into? or should i consider something else.

if there are any questions or advice you feel like i may have missed, please feel free to answer them in the comments.

thank you for any and all advice, i appreciate it.

1. I think the markets decent, but I do think it will go down over time as cars become less and less fixable. 

2. It really depends like any careers but I think ten years of the right moves and you can be pretty high up. 

3. I would say a combination of both, definitely community college over trade school as you can pick and choose classes, and there's no fixed timeline. I went to CC it was fine. 

4. I did hourly, IMO way better flat rate is a rip off. 

5. Strongly suggest getting into diesel there's alot more money in it, fleet work is also much better than dealing with customers, but this is just what I've heard I mostly do bikes (which is the lowest paying.) You could also consider being an AMT, they can make a whole lot. 

6. Just be willing to learn, own up to your mistakes, and work hard and show up on time like any other job. I would strongly recommend trying to find a job for an independent that does other jobs too, that way you can move up there. 

7. IMO not really for a few reasons. 1- professional work can suck the passion for vehicles out, this is way more fun as a hobby/ side hustle, if you do this for a living you'll never want to do it in your free time. When I worked full time as a bike mechanic I only really rode my bike to work and almost hated looking at it, now I have time to just work on bikes and cars when I please it's much more fun. And you can make decent money flipping on the side if you have good skills. 2- I feel mechanics are not really respected, both by alot of shops and also by the general public, it sort of has an unfair perception as being low class, even compared to some other blue collar work which I feel I've felt sometimes. 3- I think the health consequences are not talked about often enough the chemicals we work with are often really nasty and carcinogenic and people have a very laissez faire attitude about it. I still think you should absolutely take CC classes to learn more about it, and try it out and see how you like it. Being an AMT could be really cool. Ultimately I think many faucets of the automative industry are kinda scummy, and I am trying to figure out something different to do. These are just my two cents though, I'm sure others have other opinions. I'm not a grizzled vet of the industry by any means."

But it's not clear when you're actually buying the car — are you buying it ""now"" and then keeping it at the dealership until you collect it?  Or only buying it on the day of collection?

If it's the former, do you know that the dealership will assume liability for it (it doesn't seem likely — why would they assume responsibility for a car they don't own?).

1nacokz,Replacing the clutch master cylinder that’s failed - is something else imminent?,"2015 Ford Fiesta zetec (not ecoboost)

Couple weeks ago the clutch pedal stayed down on a drive. I kicked it back up in a panic, that’s never happened to me before so I just put it down to driver mistake and continued. Next day I drive 70 miles and it happens again. Day after i notice brake fluid all over the clutch pedal. Diagnosed as a failing master cylinder. Parts and Labour for fitting a new one £220. 

What I’m worried about now is…does this mean something else is imminently about to fail as well? One mechanic said I might as well change the slave while I’m at it - my finances just don’t allow for this.

Could I just fix this issue and be fine for ages or should I keep in mind something else will be coming sooner rather than later.

For context: bought the car in May, fresh MOT and full service history. HPI clear. 55,000 miles. June the AC belt snapped. July the tyre sensor died. August the master cylinder fails. Can’t help but feel I’ve been sold a dodgy car but all 3 seem like unrelated faults - just bad luck?

Mainly prominent in gear 1 and 2 and when idle.

Also, when I start the engine after a long while eg 6 to 12 hours later the whirring sound is very loud when starting up after putting the key in. 

My car is a mini one. 2008 model.

Is it my clutch or my engine?

Not only that,  my car started making this weird knocking sound about 4 days after the whirring sounds. It only makes this knocking sound when idle, and after the engine warms up maybe after about 5 mins. It doesn't start unless I drive.

I put a video up as well so you can hear the knocking. Have some bearings come loose within the clutch?? Are these 2 sounds linked??

1nabuyt,A bit of discussion: what’s the point of a performance car for a normal driver?,"Assuming the person is not going to track days… what are the benefits?

Performance cars often mean:

- premium price… the difference between the M and the version below is often a big jump (same for Mercedes etc)

- premium insurance

- higher maintenance: petrol, tyres, service

- more expensive problems: when something breaks… it’s way more expensive. 

- more uncomfortable:  suspension, tyres…

- often less practical 

- depreciation after guarantee finishes?

- easy to break a speed limit given the effortless powers well beyond road speeds

- low revs = boring like other cars, low gear and high revs= people think you go much faster

- being targeted /car get stolen

- a modern EV can be as fast or even faster by any average driver 

So… what’s the point?

This is more obvious in dual CC where one side heats up but the other doesn't, but in a single setup its easy to mistake when it just blows cold air throughout. That being said.... I'm not sure they can be replaced separately from the heater matrix. Maybe they are one unit.

1na6xj3,"Bought a Diesel Mazda 6, is it worth keeping?","I bought a 2013 Mazda 6 Diesel with 84k miles on it from a family member last month for £1,000

Having now read all the horror stories about them, I’m thinking of just selling it despite enjoying driving it. 

Main concerns are:

* It's a Mazda 6 Diesel. 
* MOT due next month, last year's had an advisory of rust though it looks fine
* It's mainly used for city driving, with sub 10mile commutes - especially bad on these Mazda 6's DPF. 
* Around 80k miles I've heard the fuel injector needs an expensive replacement
* Front speakers need superglued / replaced as the subwoofer has detached, causing warbled bass
* Can't adjust the clock and the time keeps rapidly advancing, checked and replaced fuses to no avail, could that be a problem in the future with electronics?

  
Does anyone have any reasons I should actually keep it? I was going to take off the door trim to repair the speakers myself and considering I only spent £1k on it maybe I can bite the bullet for the looming servicing costs with the fuel injector / DPF issues.

  
Also would it look bad trying to sell it on after only a month of ownership? I was thinking about taking it to a Mazda dealership and using it as a trade in for a Mazda 3, or are there better options to sell it?

15th July I was parked up in a car park and a vehicle reversed into me whilst I was in the office. Two witnesses were able to note the VRN down as the offender sped away from the scene.

I contacted the police immediately to report the incident,

I contacted my insurance who arranged a vehicle, towed my car and advised that they would pursue the matter.

Few days later The insurance advised that they had arranged an independent engineer from Lairds to assess the damage and enigneer advised me that the car is a write off. My insurance offered me to keep the vehicle or salvage it as per the settlement. The damage was to the front bumper and wing.

Although I was surprised to see that it was a write off, I thought that the engineer has all the neccesarry expertise and accepted his verdict.

I get the vehicle back and sell it on as it is to a garage who repairs vehicles as I had no interest in keeping it as a write off.

2 weeks ago, my insurance said that the third party insurance wanted to inspect the vehicle and I told them i had sold the car due to being informed it was a write off.

They asked me for the new keeper details and carried out the inspection at the news keeper premises. Their engineer disagreed with the first engineer and said he was inflating all the costs.

What options do I have as if I accept their offer of £3600 it would put me at a loss of £5000

The marker value is £11,260

The salvage is valued at £2060

1na470p,How to Choose the BEST Portable Tire Inflator for your Needs!,"The Convenience of a Portable Tire Inflator: One of the most frustrating things when you climb into your vehicle is when the low tire pressure light turns on. Having to drag out an air compressor, connect hoses, and fill up a tire by just a couple of pounds is a hassle. That’s where a portable air inflator comes in handy. After using the LastFit Air for the past year, I can confidently say it has been an incredibly convenient tool—especially as a parent with a small child. It's not just for tires; I've used it for everything from inflating trailer tires to pool floats on vacation, birthday party balloons, and even bouncy unicorns for Christmas. Plus, it works great for inflating sports balls. If you’re considering getting a portable inflator, here’s what you need to think about before making a decision.

Combo Features: More Isn’t Always Better: You may come across models that combine both a jump starter and a tire inflator. While this combo may seem appealing because of its lower price, I would advise against it. After trying out one of these hybrid models, I can tell you that more features often mean compromises. While it's handy to have a jump starter for emergencies, you’re going to use your tire inflator far more often. And when the two functions are combined, both tend to suffer. In my experience, using a combo inflator takes much longer to fill up tires. On the other hand, a dedicated tire inflator is faster and more efficient. My jump starter sits in the back of my truck and rarely gets used, so for me, a good-quality, stand-alone tire inflator is worth the investment.

Key Tech Specs to Consider: When shopping for a portable tire inflator, it’s easy to get lost in the sea of options, with prices ranging from $20 to $100 or more. However, the difference in price typically reflects the quality of the product, so it's important to consider the technical specifications carefully.

Airflow Capacity: One of the first things you should look at is the airflow capacity, which determines how quickly the inflator can fill your tires. For instance, the Airmoto—which is often listed as one of the best portable tire inflators—has an airflow capacity of 20 liters per minute. In comparison, the LastFit Air has a much higher airflow capacity of 50 liters per minute, meaning it can fill up tires faster and more efficiently.

Battery Capacity & Runtime: Battery capacity is another crucial factor that affects how long the inflator will work before needing a recharge. The LastFit Air comes with a 12,000 milliamp-hour (mAh) battery, while the Airmoto offers only a 2,000 mAh battery. This means the LastFit Air will run significantly longer before needing to be recharged, which is ideal if you need to inflate multiple tires or use the inflator for other purposes like inflating sports equipment or pool toys.

Price vs. Performance: Of course, price is an important consideration. The LastFit Air comes in at around $130, while the Airmoto is priced at $70. While the LastFit Air costs more, the extra price translates into better performance, particularly in airflow capacity and battery life. If you’re someone who plans to use the inflator regularly, the additional investment may be well worth it in the long run.

Models and Options for Different Needs: LastFit offers a variety of models to suit different needs. Whether you’re looking for a bike tire inflator, a car tire inflator, or a more powerful truck tire inflator (like the one I use), LastFit provides several options at different price points. This versatility allows you to choose an inflator based on the type of vehicle you own and how often you plan to use it.

Conclusion: Why You Should Buy a Portable Tire Inflator: I’m not here to say the LastFit Air is the absolute best tire inflator on the market because I haven’t tried every model out there. However, after using it for a year, I can honestly say it has made my life easier. From filling tires to inflating pool floats and toys, it’s a game-changer. I highly recommend investing in a portable tire inflator—it’ll save you time, hassle, and frustration. Just make sure to compare the specifications, consider your specific needs, and choose a model that offers the best balance of performance and price.",0,1757176797.0,3,CartalkUK,1757273591,2025-09-06 16:39:57,2025-09-07 19:33:11,"Scottish-warrior05 (Score: 6): Ask your programmer to teach you paragraphs

If you're anywhere near North or East Yorkshire, or Lincolnshire this is my personal favourite area to buy cars because the low population density means lower demand and you can haggle. 

As someone who exclusively buys cars in this price range I'd recommend the 1.8 Honda Civic, Toyota Prius (if the battery is ok), Honda Insight (the battery is easy to rejuvenate), Skoda Octavia/Fabia. 

If you don't need loads of space I'm a big fan of the Suzuki Swift, they're just a bit loud on the motorway. 

Also despite what people say about getting parts there's plenty of bargains to be had with a Saab. You can get one with 12 months MOT for less than a grand and just repeat if it ever becomes uneconomical to repair. 

Other cars I wouldn't rule out are Ford Focus, Vauxhall Astra, Hyundai i30. Again it's more important who you're buying it from and how it's been treated. 

I tend to avoid anything french because electrics can be an issue, my Audi had some electrical issues due to water ingress and BMW/Merc repairs were expensive. I used to avoid turbo cars due to more to go wrong but I've had a few now and had no issues. 

Look for models that sold in high numbers and had long runs, look for facelift versions where any initial issues have been sorted and be sure to check out the Parkers, HonestJohn or RAC used review of a car to see if any other issues have cropped up. 

It's also worth joining Facebook owners groups as cars will often be sold a bit cheaper to people who want them to go to enthusiasts. The Honda Civic and Saab pages are the friendliest/most honest ones I've experienced followed by MG."

Seems like as a lot of these were affected by the diesel gate drama, and seems like there was a software update done on some of these diesels that means the egr essentially becomes a routine maintenence item. My car had recently had a new egr valve and a year later I was running into issues again. The only options seem to be cleaning, replacing or blanking/deleting.

The earlier Fiestas of this generation used a wet timing belt. This was later switched to a chain like this car will have, but the drive belt for the oil pump is still a wet belt and will still fail, just the engine will lose all lubrication and melt instead of going out of time and grenading itself.

Lanoguard is quite famous and easy to apply lanolin based anti corrosion wax that offers around a year protection. However if you apply it before neutralising the rust, moisture will be trapped between metal and wax and you’ll increase speed of rusting. So you have to treat the rust first and then apply a protective layer like lanoguard. 

First wire brush rusted areas as much as possible then apply a converter like Bilt Hamber Hydrate 80 or Dinitrol. On the budget, you can with Jenolite, Hammerite Kurust etc.

I’ve started looking into buying a used car, and this will be my first car. 

I’ve just seen some horrifying stories about Arnold Clark, so I guess that’s out of the window as I know very little about what kind of deals are bad or what should be included but isn’t in places like that.

I think I’ll start looking into dealerships, as they seem to offer better warranty deals overall (this is based on reading some posts here). 
But let’s say I go to a dealership and want to buy an used car, I thought things I had to look out for would be when would MOT expire, if it has has any crashes (or written off), and that its not diesel because of ULEZ/LEZ zones. 

What else should I look out for or ask the seller/worker at the dealership about a car I’m interested please? 

Also what traps or deals I should look out for? For example the 60 days warranty that can be extended but that apparently it’s 6 months under consumer law ??(still need to check on that). 

Dont have any mechanic friends or anything so after getting a car I’ll be back with the same vibe of questions but things to ask/look out for when you take your car to a garage 😂.

The other driver claimed he had entered the roundabout on a green light. My car was 8 months old and I was gutted. I went through my insurance for repairs as it was bought on a PCP and I needed to maintain the warranty. I contacted the local traffic police and they found the video footage, which they could provide to my insurer for free but I would have to pay to obtain it, stupidly I trusted my insurer to get it after I gave them the details. Long story short no one followed up and now it’s been wiped. The company has accepted my complaint about this, acknowledged that I did call and give details plus follow up chasing calls without action being taken and offered £150 compensation but has refused to remove the ‘fault’ on my insurance record- saying that once liability has been proven that can be resolved. However without that footage there’s no proof.. I think the insurer is being unreasonable - I would not have asked for the footage if I had been liable and the fact that they did not request it in time is negligent and they should accept that the balance of doubt is in my favour.

I did an HPI check to make sure it wasn't crash damaged.


I have a strong preference for buying privately, because you actually get to meet the previous owner. You can ask them questions, look them in the eye and find out things that a dealer would never know. You can make a determination on what sort of owner they are. It is easy to spot when someone is a fastidious owner or an enthusiast, and that is a lot of reassurance that you don't get at all with a dealer.


If you buy from a dealer you have no sense as to how the car was treated previously.


In my experience, people selling privately are doing so because they primarily don't want to sell at a huge market undervalue to a dealer. Additionally, they like to know that the car is going to a fellow enthusiast. It is not the case that the majority of people are dishonest. 


Dealers, on the other hand, are only in it for one thing, and that is profit. And if that means screwing you over, they're happy to do that. They like to oversell their perceived benefits, such as their 150 point checks and similar. They often just buy a third party warranty, which is something you can buy yourself! 


If you are buying an older car, you can always bring a mechanic along with you.

First immediate question, what is ""a few months ago?"" I doubt it's less than 1 but is it less than six months?

Before you do anything, write a letter to your finance company right now to inform them that your car has broken down and you suspect it was because of an issue with the vehicle that existed at the inception of your contract with the finance company. You must do this **right now** because it effectively stops the clock in terms of CRA 2015. 

So to make something clear, your dealer did not supply your car to you. The finance company is the party that supplies the car, the dealer is simply a broker. I know that sounds weird, but legally that is the truth of it. 

You need to inform the finance company as in this case, the finance company provided the vehicle. But what about the trader? That's what is called a tripartite agreement. The dealer, the place where you saw and picked the car up from, is the facilitator in this action.

If you go back to the dealership without informing the finance company, this may not count as their one right of repair attempt which they are permitted in the 1-6 month time frame. This is why you have to involve the finance company literally today. Write an email to their complaints team outlining that the car has had a fault.

As for warranty, I have never before heard of one paying out for anything. They are a big money pot that for some reasons used car retailers keep flogging. My last warranty that I simply had to have did not cover drivetrain or electrical issues... seriously, that was in the contract. So what's the pissing use of it then? None? Makes sense. Nevertheless, it's the warranty provider that needs to initiate a claim. So if the dealership want to start a warranty claim to pay for repairs, that's on them. 

Either way, you keep the finance company involved as they will need to liaise with the dealership in order for it to count as their one repair attempt.

Whether they repair it or not, you need to keep yourself covered. Do this right and don't do what I did, go in without a single clue and end up many thousands of pounds out of pocket. I can't guarantee you won't, but at least give yourself a fighting chance. And remember, the finance company will be lovely and nice to you on the phone, but they are most absolutely not on your side!
