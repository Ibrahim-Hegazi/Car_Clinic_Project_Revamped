Several_Situation887 (Score: 2): Unfortunately, the code you found doesn't mean much, especially after having injectors replaced.

When dealing with fuel injectors, I've found it is best to leave the originals in place, unless you know one, or more has failed. Then, replace only the failed ones with quality replacements.

I spent a few weeks going back and forth between lean and rich codes, until I realized that the set of injectors I replaced were inferior to the old ones I thought I was upgrading. I put all the old injectors back in, and the engine ran correctly again.

I would go back to the shop that did the work, and question why the injectors were originally replaced (were they really bad?), and then I'd follow up with making sure that quality replacements were used (did you buy good Motorcraft injectors? or did you buy from Amazon?).

You may end up having to buy a set of injectors to replace the new injectors. Don't cheap out."

To me it seems like a seized caliper but the slide pins both move freely and the piston does move back when compressed. For some additional context, she had a new rotor/pads put on by a shop about a month ago. They definitely should not be wearing down this fast.

It should shoot fluid out. Anything other than that indicates a restriction, and I’d default back to replacing just about every brake component on that wheel end.

1nmbaho,What next steps to take? Should I keep fixing my 2003 Hyundai Elantra or invest in a newer car?,"Hey everyone, I'm looking for a little advice. 

I've got a 2003 Hyundai Elantra with about 150,000 miles on it. The car’s outside is trashed (i.e., peeling outer coat, small dents, cracking headlights), I've actually kept up with the maintenance pretty well over the years (i.e. followed the manual exactly, and made repairs when needed).

Recently, I took it to the mechanic to replace the spark plugs, coolant, and the coolant sensor. 

The morning I got the car back, it started showing new problems. 1) While driving, the car would randomly flee like the propulsion drops out of (i.e., it would briefly slow, in a jerky motion), 2) in neutral, the car sometimes jumps up to 3000 RPM, and 3) the car *says* that it’s overheating when it really isn’t.

The same mechanics took a look at the car a second time. They replaced the coolant sensor again, confirmed that the car isn’t actually overheating, and double checked the spark plugs. At this point, they think it’s a computer issue. They said they can’t inspect or diagnose from here, and suggest I go somewhere else.

So now I'm at a bit of a crossroads. Do I keep trying to chase down these issues, or with the age and mileage, is it smarter to start putting that money toward a newer car?

1nma6m2,Bad idea to try and DIY replacing a valve cover gasket?,"Hello,

I have a 2001, Rav4. The valve cover has been leaking, slightly. I've had a mechanic recommend replacing it. And I am thinking of doing it myself. Would that be a bad idea?

Youtube videos seem to make it straight forward, but I realize without any experience, I may not notice if something else needs fixing or if there are surprises, I may not know what to do; like breaking a brittle hose.

I also will need to clean / degrease the engine, which looks like a lot of fun. I believe the serpentine belt has gotten oil on it, so needs to be replaced to (and all the pulleys cleaned). Might also be best to replace the spark plugs?

My mechanic experience; Replacing a serpentine belt and replacing the battery.

So, for those with experience here... bad idea or I may be able to do it? I am thinking, backup option is call a mobile mechanic if I mess something up.

Bear in mind that everything you've described can be done individually - don't feel pressured to do all those jobs in one sitting if it feels overwhelming.

Some other questions are: Am I just paranoid and the coil being fixed will relieve everything? Is spending the 120 for all the spark plugs to be done something that needs to happen soon?

I would make the owner aware of the fact that you aren't comfortable with the price change, and see how they react. If they make it right, maybe it was a mistake. If they get defensive, you should leave an honest google review about their dishonest business practices and try a different shop.

There're no low signal/voltage codes so, like the fuses, the wires should be good to go too.

The seat occupied sensor also needs to communicate with the ABS module which is sending an implausible message. With that, it looks like a new or used ABS module is in order.

If you’re going to go Autel, I strongly recommend buying a US version versus a global version (sold on Amazon/eBay and some online stores, you’ll see “No IP restriction”). Napa Auto with a 20% off coupon or more if the manager likes you is well worth it over the MK808BT/MX808/MP808, etc. The MX900 is brand new and you can get it for about $450ish plus tax, US support / warranty but more importantly, I did legitimately find issues with the global models reading my cars versus the US. Software is almost identical except the global models give you apps that are in the MaxiSys line (906+).

The MX900 is wired but a solid tool and based off the same new line of Autels. The TS900 came out about a month ago and is about $676 after tax for a Bluetooth version of the MX plus TPMS but may be overkill being for home use. There is a discrepancy in the manual however that BAS (battery testing) is not supported and you have to go to a global model or move to the MS906Pro (after a long thread with support).

Alternatively, if sticking with Autel and looking for cheap and global version, try the Otofix D1 Lite or D1 Pro. The lite is cheap, about $243 plus tax on eBay and is basically a MX808 but slower (about a minute longer to scan) but gives you the same Bluetooth VCI as the one in the MS906Pro ($1,1100). A good value and 2 years of subscription and $119 for renewal if you need it. The D1 Pro is good, a bit large (I prefer the 8” MS906) without a stand but overall very good for about $550 plus tax on eBay.

AES Wave is a solid US distributor and if you call Autel US support, they can verify your serial is US. Any authorized US distributor will be US so just avoid the Amazon, AutelSale, eBay, etc with @hotmail.com emails. JB Tools is good too (good for Launch US as well) though I’ve had good success with Napa and working out a deal that usually beats the other vendors.

The other side of the coin is Launch-based scanners. Launch, similar to Autel has global and U.S. models and private labels to Matco. They also license their software out to other companies such as Topdon, ThinkCar, and Xtool. Launch is a bit more rough on translations and it’s a little less polished than Autel, but, you can get more for your money (Topology on the Topdon Phoenix models, USB C charging, cheaper models for coding and programming). To me, they’re intriguing for the tech factor but I don’t trust them nearly as much as Autel. I had a ton of issues with various Launch (global), Topdon, and ThinkCar scan tools on our 2017 Hyundai Sante Fe Ultimate. All of the ones I tested were around your price point and slowly moved my way up.

Then there’s the other group of Foxwell, Innova, and a few other smaller brands. Fine for basic diag but I’d spend a little more and get an Autel or Launch.

Lastly, there’s Snap-on. Being a Snap-on guy and all my tools are SO, the only thing I can’t justify for home use are the diag tools. I’d buy the Solus Plus that just came out but even at $2,200 (eBay), it’s insane amount for what I’m using it for. If i was making money, I’d buy it in a heartbeat as an entry level tool because you can trust that it will do everything that it shows you and not brick a module.

If you’re sticking with Autel and price point around the 808, the 900 is a nice improvement all around if you can shell out a hair more. Scan times, graph /live data response, functions, battery, build quality (screen, feel, looks), all significantly improved.

Coolant dye, clean your engine bay first. 

Use fluorescent light to see where it is leaking.

Humorouscrustacean (Score: 1): Assuming you checked the coolant level after the car had cooled down, it's possible you had some air bubbles in the loop that came out and that's why the level went down so fast. 

But yeah you probably have a leak that needs to be diagnosed. It could be a pretty slow leak or a leak that's only present while the system is under pressure. 

If you don't want to do the dye route there's also pressure testers that you let you pump the coolant system up to running pressure to watch for dripping."
1nm5lxy,Draining / i accidently put back a tiny amount of old oil back in the circuit,"Hi, 

i'm a pure noob regarding mechanic, but i'm really interested in it.

Today i did my first draining, on my Citroen xsara 1.6 16v.

after the draining i did put back the cap on the thing and then AFTER i changed my oil filter.

This resulting in a tiny amount of old oil in the filter going back in the thing. I'd say 200ml ? 

Should i drain the circuit again before putting my new oil back in or is it something i can accept ?

I aint really sure this oild oil si the same as the new. I used 10w40 for this change and the old one might be some 5w30 ( cant check at the minute ).

I have had an issue where my 92 chevy k3500 7.4l truck has been 'skipping' but not fully misfiring (not enough for a code anyways), especially around the 40mph+ range, but I can hear it also at idle, even tho its a bit more subtle. All the below repairs increased power but symptoms remained.

**Known issues, now fixed**
-fuel pump was weak, formerly 10psi max, now 16psi max;
-Ignition Control Module & coil pack replaced;
-Cap & rotor replaced;
-spark plugs & wires & fuel filter & injectors all <2 years/15000 miles old;
-ground wires front and back redone in overkill manner;

**known issues not yet fixed**
-alternator weak under load (e-fans and a/c) ~12.3v
-suspect dizzy coil pickup bad, due to process of elimination.

*questions*

1: Is the distributor capable and likely causing my described symptoms;

2: I noticed, after a long struggle of removing the dizzy bottom rollpin, that the magnet (?) under the copper dust cover riveted to the long shaft, is crumbling. This is critically bad and needs replacement or is that normal wear? Is this my problem?

3: Is there some kind of maintenancev I need to be doing with my dizzy thats caused this wear?

4: The copper dust cap is cracked and in bad shape all around, can I send it?

5: Is there a way to replace the shaft/magnet and what is the part actually called?

6: should I get a new dizzy, or is this one salvageable? I am broke broke, it will cost my family food money to spend money on a new one, but the time factor and lost transportation factor in also. If replacement is needed, what brand has longevity?

7: There was no snap ring or retainer holding the dust cap to the top under the rotor. No visible slot for one. Abnormal, correct?

Similar with v8 engines, so at TDC there should be 2 cylinders that will be at TDC that you can adjust, then you do the quarter turn for the next two cylinders.

On a lot of vehicles, yes. You may be able to replace ball joints separately from control arms, but in the vast majority of cases a control arm will include a ball joint.

Shops worth doing business with will generally recommend control arms over ball joints in cases where the total part/labor cost to swap out the ball joint exceeds the cost of just replacing the whole control arm, and/or cases where the control arm's bushings are shot and need to also be replaced."

I’m also a welder by trade, so could easily fab up either part buckets, or mounting brackets for magnetic parts trays. I’ve seen some people say they hate the way 4 wheel creepers move however and have no experience with them myself. The 6 wheel also appeals to me, as it’s essentially a much nicer version of the creeper I have now and the magnetic mounts for lights and parts trays look awesome.

	•	P0300: Random/multiple cylinder misfire
	•	P0302: Cylinder 2 misfire
	•	P0303: Cylinder 3 misfire

I replaced the spark plugs and the cables attached to them. The car runs normally, no power loss, but while driving the light sometimes flashes briefly for a second or two, then goes off, repeating a few times during a drive.

Questions:
	1.	Is this normal after replacing plugs and cables, or does it mean the problem isn’t fully fixed?
	2.	Can I safely drive it for a couple more days (delivery work) until the mechanic can check it?
	3.	What else could cause misfires on cylinders 2 and 3 if plugs and cables are new? Injectors, wiring, something else?

I have a 2022 Chrysler Voyager LX with ~$59k miles. Today, my car wouldn’t start and the brake pedal is stiff. When I try to start it, it tries for a second or two, then just stops and doesn’t starts. I don’t believe it’s the battery, because everything lights up perfectly.

This is sort of a bummer and hoping it’s not something that requires a $750-1000 to fix. 😫

•	⁠Changed key fob battery.
•	⁠Turning on and off the parking break.
•	⁠Wished to the car gods for it to start.

If the engine isn't running, you have no power brakes, so it's normal for the brake pedal to feel stiff/stuck/hard (after you've pressed it a couple of times, and used up all the stored vacuum from the power braking system). So ignore that symptom.

""I don’t believe it’s the battery, because everything lights up perfectly."" No. It takes a lot more battery power to start the engine than to power the lights. So you can't assume the battery is OK. Do the dash lights go dim when you try to start the engine? That would tend to confirm that there isn't enough battery power to do everything.

The battery would be the first suspect with your car's symptoms. Try a jump start, with jumper cables from another car (or jump pack). Or get the battery tested -- places that sell batteries will normally do that for free. But maybe also check that the battery terminal connections are clean and tight."

I have a 22 ram rebel 1500. 25,000 miles. 

Mods: s&b cold air, borla exhaust, boost auto illumisteps m2, diode dynamics trailer hitch receiver light pod. 

So here is the issue. Hop in my truck and it says the front right blinker is out. Check the front, mirror, and rear. All is well. Mirror blinker is blinking rapidly and so it the arrow on the dash. 

I have boost auto m2 illumisteps. They are flashing fast as well. 

1st quick rundown: make sure everything is plugged in correctly. Check connections for water or corrosion. Unplug hitch pod. Change third brake lights out. Same thing still happens. Go over it again. No avail. Disconnect passenger side wiring harness for the steps. Blinker on mirror is still fast. Reconnect everything and go inside for dinner and lose sleep over it. 

2nd run down: Hit up AutoZone for fuses, contact cleaner, and more third brake lamp bulbs (read this could be the issue). As I pull the truck into the garage,  I notice that both low beam leds in headlight are flickering. Drl’s are flickering. (Yay more problems). Park truck in the garage. Disconnect the battery and let it sit for two hours. Come back after two hours, While battery is still unplugged, I swap out 3rd brake lap bulbs to fresh set. Disconnect the fuses and all plugs that attach to truck for the steps. Unplug hitch light again. Cleaned the piss out of the contacts for the headlight (male and female) and let it sit to dry. Hook everything back up except for the steps. Hook up battery. Start truck. Boom, front light blinker error again. But wait, dash blinker is fast but no other blinker is. Leave blinker on for 30 seconds. Turn truck off and then start it again. No blinker error, no fast blinker indicator. But head light starts to flicker and continues progressively get worse. Turn truck off and take a shot of whiskey. 

At this point i am unaware of any fuses that belong to the headlights, tail lights, mirror indicator, or third brake lamp. If you know where it is please tell me as I just may dumb and missed it. 

I’m open to any suggestions or advice from those of you that have dealt with this. 

My opinion is the headlight going bad, or is bad.

Okay, so I drive a 2016 Nissan Juke, which has never really run great to begin with. I got it from my stepmom, and I feel like I shouldn't have paid her ANY money, but I did. I have spent so much money on repairs to this car, and it needs SO MUCH MORE. I'm anxious every time I turn the car on now, and I'm always nervous to get it checked out every time I get my oil changed and such.  
Example: I need a new transmission because mine leaks. I need a new battery (again) because it's just time. I might have a bad pump or a broken coolant system (I get an overheating light sometimes, but I don't know if it's a bad sensor because I have other lights in the car that are just bad sensors or the real deal-- but I always pull over if I see it). My AC isn't great. I fear I'll end up with an overheating issue and will need a new engine... there's so so much more.

I feel like I have the opportunity to just... get a new car instead of spending more than I would on a down payment to fix the transmission and the pump, etc. But I also just moved out. Is it worth it to just... get a new used car? If so, any recommendations?

1nmbagt,What next steps to take? Should I keep fixing my 2003 Hyundai Elantra or invest in a newer car?,"Hey everyone, I'm looking for a little advice. 

I've got a 2003 Hyundai Elantra with about 150,000 miles on it. The car’s outside is trashed (i.e., peeling outer coat, small dents, cracking headlights), I've actually kept up with the maintenance pretty well over the years (i.e. followed the manual exactly, and made repairs when needed).

Recently, I took it to the mechanic to replace the spark plugs, coolant, and the coolant sensor. 

The morning I got the car back, it started showing new problems. 1) While driving, the car would randomly flee like the propulsion drops out of (i.e., it would briefly slow, in a jerky motion), 2) in neutral, the car sometimes jumps up to 3000 RPM, and 3) the car *says* that it’s overheating when it really isn’t.

The same mechanics took a look at the car a second time. They replaced the coolant sensor again, confirmed that the car isn’t actually overheating, and double checked the spark plugs. At this point, they think it’s a computer issue. They said they can’t inspect or diagnose from here, and suggest I go somewhere else.

So now I'm at a bit of a crossroads. Do I keep trying to chase down these issues, or with the age and mileage, is it smarter to start putting that money toward a newer car?

I remember a silver one here that was in the auto trader for about 4years, owner was looking 12k for it because it was rare, and I'd be surprised if anyone gave that kinda money for it. 

The most tragic part about the Sera imo - Toyota were still using the 4efte in the Galanza when they released the Sera, the 1300turbo was twice the engine that the 1500na was, the 1300t made 144hp and the 1500 made 100hp.

At the time here in the early 00s, we must have had about 80% of the GT turbo starlet and Galanza Vs ever made, the next best thing to a GT/Galanza was a 1.5 Cynos which was the same as the Sera mechanically but way faster. - The Sera was a joke car

On a tight turn it will clunk, clunk, clunk, it’s almost like it’s stuttering. It’s how I imagine a car with square wheels would move, but not as dramatic. I’m not sure how to explain it well. It never stalls or anything, though.

We took it back and they removed & replaced the front lower control arms. The invoice also says ""Things to be done: Front link pins."" 

We've picked it up today and it's still doing the clunking thing. They never told us what the front link pins are for? Is it still acting up because they haven’t done that yet? I’d like to assume with the thousands we paid and all the stuff they replaced that it wouldn’t still be doing that, haha

Before she gave the car to me she went to multiple mechanics and got a lot done to fix the car. Unfortunately i dont know who the mechanics are or what specifically was done to the car besides a battery replacement on 8/11/24 because the contact between her and my mom about the car was very minimal.

I have asked my dad and a few other people what they think but lowk my dad thinks that theres nothing wrong w it… 
So over the past 4 months ive noticed
- when i first start it in the morning the engine surges and jumps from 1.2k rpms to about 1.8k (which isnt a whole lot but i feel is enough to be like why is it doing allat) 
-it will also noticeably idle really rough and ive noticed randomly that no matter the temperature it is the car will start and idle at 1.5k rpms instead of its normal 0.7k
-it has a lot of trouble getting up to speed and picking up speed and sometimes when it gets bad it will not go above about 60mph no matter how much i press on the gas pedal (i live in between states where the speed limits on the interstates go from 65-70 so people start getting pissed at me lol) 
-i have a lot of engine noise that comes through my radio and i also have this strange almost vaccuum sounding noise that comes through whenever i accelerate. 
- when im in town with stop lights or where i have to stop and go or slow down and speed up often it again has trouble regaining speed 
-ive noticed theres a lot of shaking that definitely is very recent and had just gotten worse
These are the things off of the top of my head that i could come up with, some other things to consider is
-im not due for any oil change or maintenance as far as me/my parents are aware
-the problems ive been having havent been detrimental yet as theyve gone on for awhile and could just be because its old..?
-ive tried coming up with things that are wrong and my parents will check on my car and find nothing wrong

1nma8so,get repairs vs new car -- what do i do?,"Also posted to r/carbuying  
Okay, so I drive a 2016 Nissan Juke, which has never really run great to begin with. I got it from my stepmom, and I feel like I shouldn't have paid her ANY money, but I did. I have spent so much money on repairs to this car, and it needs SO MUCH MORE. I'm anxious every time I turn the car on now, and I'm always nervous to get it checked out every time I get my oil changed and such.  
Example: I need a new transmission because mine leaks. I need a new battery (again) because it's just time. I might have a bad pump or a broken coolant system. My AC isn't great. I fear I'll end up with an overheating issue and will need a new engine... there's so so much more.

I feel like I have the opportunity to just... get a new car instead of spending more than I would on a down payment to fix the transmission and the pump and etc. But I also just moved out. Is it worth it to just... get a new used car? If so, any recommendations on what I should use or what car to get? I'm just mentally exhausted by this car, and I can't take it anywhere until I get it fixed, so I feel like at this point I can spend a few thousand on repairs OR I can spend a few thousand on a down payment...

1nm4teq,Inconsistent braking issue,"I have an 2009 Suzuki SX4 which has disc brakes in the front and drum brakes at the rear. Last year I had an issue where the rear left drum brake would not properly disengage and got hot (this was fixed by a certified mechanic that changed the brake wheel cylinder and then greased up the moving parts).

Now I have an occasionally reoccurring issue when I brake. Most of the time the car brakes normally. The car brakes well and goes straight even under emergency breaking, but now and then (around 1 in 20 times) the pedal suddenly goes much further in than normal. Under this condition, I am able to push the pedal all the way to the floor, the car still brakes a decent amount but the steering pulls heavily to the left. If I let the pedal back up again the problem is gone the next time I press it and the car brakes normally again. I usually have to try between 6-30 times to get this issue to happen, and I have never experienced the problem twice in a row.

Does anyone have an idea of what could be causing this? Since it's pulling to the left I think the issue must be on the right side, and since it still is braking a decent amount I was thinking maybe it is the rear wheel and not the front?

1nmafj9,"High clutch biting point, rollback issues, and oil spill after 8K RPM slope launch — what should I replace?","2019 Volkswagen Golf 1.0 TSI (116 HP), 6-speed manual

Two weeks ago, I went on a vacation to a hilly area. While stuck in traffic, I had to use half clutch frequently to avoid rollbacks. After coming back to the city, I noticed a slight rollback on slopes and a higher clutch biting point than usual.

Today’s incident:
I’ve kind of gotten used to this new high biting point, but during a short city trip I got stuck in standstill traffic on a sloppy flyover.
	•Even though my car has Auto Hold, it started rolling back as soon as I released the clutch and pressed the gas.
	•I braked and tried again, same issue.
	•So I put it in neutral and let Auto Hold / Hill Assist keep the car in place (I have an electronic handbrake, so not really useful for quick slope launches).
	•Then, on half clutch, I gave it gas — and suddenly the car shot up to 8000 RPM within a second. It basically launched uphill.

After parking, I noticed a small oil spill around a part in the engine bay (picture attached). I also compared the oil color with fresh oil, and it looks a bit burnt.

Questions:
	1.	Does this indicate a burst pipe/valve, or is a little spill normal?
	2.	I’m already planning to replace the clutch — should I also change the flywheel?
	3.	What other services/parts should I consider if this oil spill isn’t normal?

Disclaimer: I used ChatGPT to help organize my post and make it more readable, but the content/experience is original.

TL;DR: Used half clutch a lot in hill traffic → now high biting point + rollback issues. Today, car rolled back despite Auto Hold, then accidentally launched to 8K RPM on a slope. Later saw oil spilled in engine bay. Already planning clutch replacement — should I also do flywheel + anything else?

1nlqniw,Possible bcm issue with headlights,"Hello. I recently had an issue with a 2020 Ford ecosport ses. I bought led replacement bulbs for my headlight only for the driver side low beam to not work, I swapped the bulb with the passenger side, and it had the same problem. I had done some research to see what is going on and thought it might be a fuse issue, after checking my owner's manual I could'nt see which fuse was for the headlights. After digging further I found out that the 2020 model powers the headlights with the body control module. And was recommended to go to a mechanic to check for a code. Would checking for a specific code with the scanner cost a lot? I've tried to search for costs, and seen that diagnostic can cost upwards to 100 and over. I understand why it might cost as much, but dont have much at the moment, and i dont want to pay that much only for their to not be much of an issue, like a loose connector or something? Or paying that much just to be told that I might have to replace something for like 300 or something. Also in the long run is it cheaper to buy a scanner that can scan bcm codes and such and just fixing certain things at home?

(I put those longer bolts in there temporarily to keep things sorta lined up until I figure this out).

Short of tearing everything back down, any tricks of the trade? I would like to think there is possibly a slight misalignment between the input shaft and the pilot bushing keeping it from going all the way, but I don't know if I've even reached the pilot bearing yet.

If I could find a way to release pressure on the clutch disc, maybe that would give me some wiggle room?

1nlvgsw,Wheel alignment issues will my partner not be able to do her driving test.,"Hi all.

So im in the UK and my partner has a driving test on the 30th....after 6months of waiting and one cancellation by them. (Dont get me started!!).

Unfortunately her instructor isnt available and the only car available for the test is our 2008 ford fiesta.

I got the car serviced and cleaned in preperation and all fine aside from the drivers side tyre needing replacing which I got done. The reason for that tire was due to wheel alignment.

So I took it to a garage to check the alignment and they said it was shot. They have tried to fix it as best they can but are at the limits of the machine. They suspect it has been hit hard and the axels maybe slightly out.

I feel the alignment is worse now as to stay in a straight line the steering wherl needs to be slightly turned to the right...much more noticeable than before the wheel alignment check.

If the  examiner notices she is holding the steering wheel slightly right will they abandon the test on grounds of safety?

The car is fine otherwise and for us perfect as once she is past the test it will be used maybe twice a week as we both work from home, so no need to go anywhere other than social occasions and the weekly shop.

We are saving for a new car but hoping to keep this one going for another 12months so she can gain experience driving by herself and it doesn't really matter what happens to it via trials and tribulations of a new, inexperienced driver.

Had my classic Chevy at a shop owned by a family friend that a family member works at since I was having issues with getting a firm brake pedal after doing some work myself. Got the car back yesterday, they remade a few lines to clean up a line lock install and rebled the brakes, as well as threw a new proportioning valve at it. Well as I leave I realize the pedal isn’t any better, but they said it was fine and I was hoping to race it, so I decided to send it. Got to the track and looked under the car and brake fluid everywhere. Took a look, and the tech forgot to tighten the rear line from the proportioning valve and the rear line from the master, like barely finger tight so it was pouring fluid out, luckily it made it to the track. Decided I wanted to tow it home since I didn’t know what else was wrong, the owner of the shop said no and drove out to fix it himself, only to still not have a good brake pedal feel still. Got a tow home today and I realized my newer inner fender and prop valve mounting bracket have peeling paint after the brake fluid ate it when they didn’t wash it off, and there’s a giant scuff on the fender. I pointed out the brakes sucked at which point the owner and the family member both exploded and saying I was being a bitchy little brat and other bullshit insults because they wouldn’t admit they were wrong. I’m out a few hundred bucks from them plus about 600 for towing plus whatever it’ll cost to fix the paint, they say they didn’t do anything wrong.

We got it fully inspected by multiple mechanics we trust and everything is perfect. I live in the midwest and so I've heard that during the winters I need to wash my car often due to salt eating away at the bottom. 

I was doing more research today and found that the usual touchless washes are not worth it at all. I saw some other self-serve car washes that could be good (i can spray underneath and clean), but I wanna be washing it as often as possible and they tend to be expensive, I dont wanna spend that much per week if I dont need to. Couldn't find any specifically undercarriage car washes in my area at all unfortunately.

I know im able to clean my own car if I were to buy some soap and towel etc, but what should I do in regards to the bottom? It came with no rust underneath it so I wanna keep in the best shape possible. We got really lucky finding a car this great so I want to make it last as long as possible. (it was taken very very well care of)

Besides making sure my undercarriage is safe from salt, I'm going to probably get all the fluids/oil changed every 4k miles. What else is there for me to do in terms of maintenance? How can I learn more about what to look out for, how to take care of my car etc? I'd love to learn to work on it so Ill probably start by learning how to change my own oil/fluids but any other tips? 

Thanks!",1,1758408155.0,10,AskMechanics,1758483068,2025-09-20 22:42:35,2025-09-21 19:31:08,"PRFitnessYT (Score: 1): No no no. Do not wash the car in the winter. Get it rust proofed with Fluid Film, Woolwax, or Krown (in Canada). Every year before winter. Then only wash when the salt is gone and it’s rained like 3 times. I’m talking end of April, May. From there, wash it every day, wax it, make it look pretty. But from November to May, do not wash the car, let the rust proofing do its job. 

Some may disagree with this. I live in Ontario Canada. Every car is rusty unless done this way. I know what I’m talking about. Some people say “wash off the salt every day”. No. You’ll never get it all off. You’re adding water into the mix. The solution to keeping metal from rusting has always been OIL.


Also, in terms of fluids. Oil every 4? Great? Everything else is WAY overboard. You can still go overboard without going THAT overboard. Just do some research into what people in the Corolla community do. Some fluids are good for like 2-5 years. Don’t change them every 4K miles lol

EEL123 (Score: 1): congrats on getting an excellent first car!

For the salt, you could get an undercoat. avoid rubberized coatings, they just seal the moisture and salt in. Fluid film or NH oil undercoating are ideal in my opinion.

[here is your service manual](https://charm.li/Toyota/2006/) \- refer to that for fluid change intervals, torque specs, etc. 

I think the best underrated mechanic skill is observation. so listening to the car, looking for leaks or broken bits. If something seems incorrect learn what to look for.

When you change the transmission fluid be sure to get a replacement aluminum crush washer. 

my advice is to try to do whatever you can, and buy an extra tool if you need it for a job. 

Good luck!"

Two weeks ago, I went on a vacation to a hilly area. While stuck in traffic, I had to use half clutch frequently to avoid rollbacks. After coming back to the city, I noticed a slight rollback on slopes and a higher clutch biting point than usual.

Today’s incident:
I’ve kind of gotten used to this new high biting point, but during a short city trip I got stuck in standstill traffic on a sloppy flyover.
	•	Even though my car has Auto Hold, it started rolling back as soon as I released the clutch and pressed the gas.
	•	I braked and tried again, same issue.
	•	So I put it in neutral and let Auto Hold / Hill Assist keep the car in place (I have an electronic handbrake, so not really useful for quick slope launches).
	•	Then, on half clutch, I gave it gas — and suddenly the car shot up to 8000 RPM within a second. It basically launched uphill.

After parking, I noticed a small oil spill around a part in the engine bay (picture attached). I also compared the oil color with fresh oil, and it looks a bit burnt.

Questions:
	1.	Does this indicate a burst pipe/valve, or is a little spill normal?
	2.	I’m already planning to replace the clutch — should I also change the flywheel?
	3.	What other services/parts should I consider if this oil spill isn’t normal?

Disclaimer: I used ChatGPT to help organize my post and make it more readable, but the content/experience is original.

TL;DR: Used half clutch a lot in hill traffic → now high biting point + rollback issues. Today, car rolled back despite Auto Hold, then accidentally launched to 8K RPM on a slope. Later saw oil spilled in engine bay. Already planning clutch replacement — should I also do flywheel + anything else?",2,1758404696.0,4,AskMechanics,1758483068,2025-09-20 21:44:56,2025-09-21 19:31:08,"Aggravating_Day1851 (Score: 2): I can't tell if that's engine oil or dirty hydraulic oil.

Most everything was good, aside from my right shock absorber having a leak and also a recommendation to do a brake flush. They gave me a quote for the repairs, but I decided to go to a second shop I'm familiar with and get another quote.

Very curiously, this second shop didn't agree the car needed a brake flush.

So, the consensus is as follows:

Shop 1 says I need to replace the shock and get a brake flush, but the brakes themselves are good.  
Shop 2 agreed on the shock replacement, but denied the need for a brake flush and were the only ones to mention the rear brakes need replacing.

BriefCorrect4186 (Score: 2): In fleet, run all repairs past the foreman. You don't know which vehicles absolutely must be back on the road the same day and if you disable a vehicle for repairs then people get grumpy.


Before starting any repairs, make sure you have the parts in your hand. The store man may promise you have the right item in stock, or that the local parts supplier 'will look after us' but you will be the bunny holding the ball if it falls through.


The drivers will have a way to report work needed. Make sure they use it, don't let them give you a verbal description of work needed without a paper trail. Driver's like having new shiny shit on their rig or trailer and your foreman will have their chosen favourites and whipping boys who get crumbs.
Don't loan a driver tools to 'adjust' anything. They will fuck it up and you will have to unfuck it. Probably at 3 am as a call out.


Don't forget to take care of the yard pigs and trailer tugs, they need love too and are likely to be neglected.


The fleet will be neglected when you get there. Don't try to 'prove' yourself by fixing every POS that the last guy touched. Document everything. Ask how the shop does things, like how they actually measure remaining brake shoe lining. Is it a guesstimate or do they actually measure using a ruler ( not just holding a thumb up to the inspection port).


You may be the one doing a tear down, but some other poor bastard may be putting it back together. And vice versa. Learn who is decent to pick up after, who is best to shadow and who is best to avoid. Try not to get sucked into the snitching and bitching, it gets addictive and doesn't help.


Fleet work can be good, you will learn the vehicles and get to the stage where you can service them with eyes shut. You get the chance to do the same repairs many times and improve and it becomes worth investing in specialty tools for the whole shop. It is a nice feeling when everyone hooks in and can reline a trailer efficiently and without fuss and not one person doing the whole job.

I have a 2022 Chrysler Voyager with ~$59k miles. Today, my car wouldn’t start and the brake pedal is stiff. When I try to start it, it tries for a second or two, then just stops and doesn’t starts. I don’t believe it’s the battery, because everything lights up perfectly.

I drive an old car, Renault Twingo I, from 1999 or 1995.
I was going straight, downhill, at around 25-30mph, when I started to brake while downshifting. At first it was braking relatively fine, usually this car doesnt brake as well as other cars as it is an old car, but then the brake started working very little, I nearly rear ended the car in front of me (and at the time it stopped working I was going at like 10mph max).

It was raining, and I think the patch of road I drove on look slippier than the rest of the road.

I was near home so I went back slowly, but the brakes were working just fine.
Is it possible that I hydroplaned even though I was going straight ?
I replaced my tires recently (2 months ago), they weren't new but my father said they could hold for 2500 miles at least before needing a replacement (he's not a mechanic though).
Also, my tires makes that squealing sound (the one it makes when you turn very fast) very often, especially when I turn or brake, even at low speed and even when I'm not braking hard.

I'm planning on replacing all tires, 2 months ago my father already checked my levels (oil, brake fluid etc) and he also said that my brake pads were fine (but then again he's not a mechanic).

You most likely have some corrosion in the caliper cylinder bore that's causing the piston to hang up.
Depending on how broke and/or ambitious you are, most calipers can be rebuilt fairly easily...

I was doing some maintenance on my 2006 Mitsubishi Pajero NS petrol and I made a mistake 😩🫣

I was trying to remove a bolt on the engine hanger that goes from the cylinder head to the intake plenum on the right bank. I was using a ratcheting spanner with a nano socket, to avoid taking the EGR pipe out, which worked great, too great and got a bit carried away, causing the bolt to come out at a slight angle. It cross-threaded and damaged the entry of the aluminum threads in the cylinder head.

The bolt eventually came out after I removed the EGR pipe, but the damage is done.

I need to put this hanger back on properly. What's the recommended repair for a stripped thread in a cylinder head like this?

I recently bought a used 2009 VW Polo, and it came with an aftermarket rear parking sensor system already installed. It’s causing me some anxiety, and I’d love some help figuring out how to fully disconnect it.

Here’s what’s happening:

It beeps loudly for a few seconds when I start the car, even if I’m not in reverse.

While I’m driving forward, it will randomly start beeping again, like it’s detecting something — even when there’s nothing behind me.

I’m pretty confident this isn’t the factory system. It looks like an old aftermarket install, and I’d be perfectly happy to disable it permanently. I'm just not tech savvy.

Things I’ve already done or learned:

I cleaned all the sensors gently — no obvious damage, but the beeping continues.

I'm aware that this kind of issue won’t damage the car, which is a relief.

I’m just looking to get rid of the beeping and avoid messing with anything unnecessary.

Apprehensive_Shoe_39 (Score: 2): Firstly my source/experience is from A4s.

They won't kick in just from AC being turned on. There is still sufficient ambient cooling to negate the needs for fans even with AC on if the ambient temp is low enough. I very rarely get my fans to kick on, and mostly that's high temp/high humidity days.

If your coolant gauge is saying 90c that's not necessarily the actual real time temp of the coolant as it's a rolling average You need to use diag tools to get the actual, live, data. Also, the temp sensor that triggers the fans on/off may not be the same as the one that sends data to the dash cluster (\~70% sure they are different but not 100%).

I'd be very surprised if you can get a 1.6 TDI hot enough in September to warrant the fans to kick in.... within the UK it's more of a problem to keep heat **in** the engine.

The fans are very well monitored by the modules so if they fail to turn on when commanded there will be a fault code to give you an idea why. It won't trigger a CEL. But an appropriate diag tool will read these codes.

Lastly in my A4's the fans are powered through a distro box under the bonnet. They do have conventional fuses to activate but the core power draw is down a strip type fuse. I know the A3 has the battery up front and the A4 has it in the boot so that may be a model specific way to power the fans, but I'd check if it's similar setup to the A3.

Yes, cars go wrong more often, because there is more to go wrong (more parts, more sensors, more points of failure) but the way they go wrong is usually less fatal than it used to be. Alot of problems are sensors reading values outside of their range for one reason or another, and because everything is so sensitive, vehicles will often refuse to start or enter limp mode for the smallest of problems, even if it's not *really* a problem.

The issue though, is that there really isn't much difference between a faulty sensor, one off bad reading or minor electrical issue and an actual fault like starter motor, alternator, coils etc. They all result in you not being able to use your car, even though alot of these issues are solved with code clearing and/or battery resets, so technically I would say cars are overall more unreliable.

As for different makes, some are more reliable than others. Peugeot, Citroën and Vauxhall are all the same cars underneath and are riddled with issues over the last few years (wet belts causing catastrophic engine failure, electrical issues plaguing EV variants of all models to name a few). Nissan and Renault (also Dacia, super-budget Renaults) are the same underneath for the last decade, that's why Nissan has gone from reliable and affordable Japanese brand to sharing the same build quality as a Renault; poor. Ford have also been plagued with wet belt issues, but are otherwise quite reliable. VWAG group cars (vw, skoda, seat, audi, cupra) are all still quite a solid bet, and are priced as such.

Tldr; yes, most cars are usually less reliable."

I think that it’s time we spoke about the misconceptions with diesel cars. 

Yes, I know, we could use many Land Rover models as examples of diesel cars being unreliable, but that’s due to the very poor manufacturing. A good example would be something like a Toyota Land Cruiser, that we all know, is absolutely solid! 

I’ve seen/heard many people speak quite negatively about high mileage diesels, but what many are failing to remember/realise is that diesel cars were built to rack up high mileage, so long as they’re maintained correctly… 

Buying a higher mileage diesel car might actually be beneficial, due to the fact that many of the expensive things that go within the first 100k miles have already been done. 

I bought my Land Rover Freelander 2 at 149k miles last year June. It has now done 175k, and still runs beautifully.

1nm6xr7,"Tiguan 2014 4Motion, with too much motion.","Hi Mechanics,

I bought a 2014 Tiguan 4Motion TDI a couple months ago, it had a little wobble on it, which I initially thought was the tie rods. Car has been for a good service at a reputable dealer and came back tip top.

However, they could not find the wobble, and checked the tie rods, all is well. 

The wobble is still there, under heavy acceleration I can nearly shake the car to bits. If I simply accelerate normally I can feel it but it’s ok. NB: The steering wheel is solid in my hands and does NOT rattle around as one would expect with a bad tie rod or wheel balancing.

If I accelerate hard, the wobble is bad, and as soon as I let off the throttle it vanishes. I have done around 500mls(maybe more) and on the motorway it’s very balanced and the wheel alignment could not be better. On an uphill the wobble kicks off too, so it only happens when the car is under some load.

I can kick off the wobble at any time by mashing the throttle to the floor.

My mechanic said it may be a problem on the gearbox, but I’m sure that would be immediately apparent and affect the fuel economy or gear change or anything in that department, which is really good! Gear change is perfect on the DSG auto box.

I have a feeling this has to do with the 4Motion system, which is frightening… I have checked the wheels and everything is tight. Just have no idea what would cause this to happen only under load.

1nm6i80,Best way to get benefits from VWFS on HP when plan is to pay cash,"Hey folks. Thanks for taking the time to check this post out and help a fellow human. I’ve just put a deposit down on a new car. The dealership mentioned that if I use HP to finance the car, I’d get two years worth of servicing for £99 and two years of warranty. If I pay with cash, I don’t get much less benefits. Here’s exactly what they said:

“I have attached what I think is the best option for financing. It is an 18 month Hire Purchase borrow of £5,000 which is the lowest borrow/term to get the benefits. The cash price of £27,793 is the car at £27,499 + 195 for 12 months tax + £99 for the service plan. The advance payment is your car plus £5,293 which totals £22,793. The add charges are the interest due over the term
 
The benefits are an additional year’s warranty (£700), additional years breakdown cover (£250) and a reduced-price service plan (£99 instead of £519 saving £420). This totals £1,370 which when compared to the £499.54 of interest payable saves you £870.46 so it’s in essence better than a 0% interest loan.
 
The Hire Purchase is more straightforward than the PCP as it doesn’t involve maximum deposits or final payments etc.”

What’s the best option for me here? Is it possible to settle from the agreement within the 14 day cooling off period and keep the benefits? The dealership said to let it run for a few months or there could be “difficulties”. Am I being ripped off here somehow, or is this genuinely a good option?

I’m not a car person, but got a good vibe from the dealerships online presence and professionalism in person. However this car just died on me with an engine misfire fault. A local garage did a compression test and confirmed it would need a new engine. So my wife and I decided we would have to cut our losses and sell it at webuyanycar.

We paid the dealer 6.5k. WBAC informed us the car was cat-n which basically knocked a whole load off the price combined with the engine fault so we are now just shy of six grand out of pocket after barely a year of ownership.

With Japanese cars you need to worry about rust, and it did get an advisory in 2023 for ""underside of vehicle generally corroded"". Hasn't been mentioned since then, however.

Based on the annual mileage, it seems like the same person has owned it for many years. And I'd say they've been a bit... iffy about maintenance. You can see the same advisories appearing for multiple years before they get sorted, usually only after the car's actually failed. Not a good sign. However, these fails have mostly been for stuff like suspension bushes, ARB linkages, etc, problems which are isolated and don't have long-term consequences once they're fixed.

I'd closely check the service history; make sure there's a stamp for every year, not every 10-12k. Have a look under the car to see if the underbody corrosion is visible. If the whole car is coated with underseal I'd be suspicious the rust has just been covered, rather than properly treated.

The basic EJ20 SOHC is a reliable engine, but thirsty. Mated to an auto gearbox it's going to be slow as well (0-60 in 13s). A I'd definitely get a test drive to see if it's good enough for you; looks aren't everything.

Personally I'd go for something more economical or quicker (depending on your priorities). However, I'm not sure what's available for £1750, especially if you really want/need 4WD."

I booked it in at another main dealer, who have been very helpful and they have fixed the recall! They said there is a fuel leak which is where the smell is coming from - it’s the fuel injector seals that need doing and a new fuel rail - all covered under warranty.

When seeing what else was available, the Mazda 2 comes up which is the same car and same price, but also, the MG3 comes up. Seems very similar to the Yaris in terms of engine (1.5l self charging hybrid) and has all the modern features the Yaris does. But, offers on Carwow start at £15,745 which is hilariously good value.

Need your help!!

So I bought a car from a dealership( Proper Motors Ltd) recently (Citroen C3, 2014). Looked great – shiny exterior, clean interior, everything seemed fine. But a couple weeks in, I’ve hit a massive problem. The car basically has no power going uphill – even on a tiny incline in first gear it feels like I’m driving in 4th/5th. Took it to a garage, they said it’s a compression issue but can’t pinpoint the root cause. Just diagnosing it properly would be expensive and apparently not even worth it for this car. I’ve already sunk £300 into servicing and other little fixes since buying it.

Now I’m stuck with two questions:

1) Consumer Rights Act 2015
I know I should be covered since it’s been less than 30 days. I emailed the dealer and also sent a physical letter to their registered address + the Google Maps location. The problem: they’re shutting down the dealership next week and leaving the country. Pretty sure they’ll just ignore me. What can I actually do here to enforce a return/refund before they vanish? Am I basically screwed if they just disappear?
(FYI my 30-day period ends on 25 September).

2) Insurance
If I manage to return the car, what happens with the insurance? I only took out the policy less than a month ago. Do insurers normally refund most of it if you cancel that early, or do you just eat the cost?

Extra context: I’m based in Truro, but I bought the car from Luton. (Before anyone asks why I went so far — we were on a trip to London, saw the listing on AutoTrader, and the MOT history looked perfect with no advisories, so we went for it. In hindsight… yeah 😬).

1nlqfo8,Looking for advice on a 2019 Leon FR (1.5 TSI) vs 2020 Leon FR (2.0 TDI DSG),"Hi everyone,

Yesterday I test drove a 2019 Seat Leon FR Black Edition, 6-speed manual with the 1.5 TSI engine. I really liked it – fun to drive, well equipped, and it looks great. I even reserved it so I could go back today to sort out a possible PX and negotiate a price.

But last night, while doing some research, I stumbled on a lot of posts about the infamous kangarooing issue with the 1.5 TSI (especially in cold weather or stop-start traffic). Digging into the car, I found it has the DADA engine code. Opinions online are all over the place – some say the software update fixes it, others say it doesn’t, and a few claim they never had the issue at all.

When I test drove it yesterday, I did notice a couple of slight kangarooing moments in 1st gear while crawling in traffic. At the time I just assumed it was me not being used to the clutch, but now I’m second-guessing.

To complicate things, I went back on Auto Trader and found another option for £280 more:
	•	2020 Leon FR Black Edition
	•	Same colour/spec
	•	2.0 TDI with 7-speed DSG auto
	•	1 owner from new
	•	60k miles (vs 40k on the TSI)
	•	Minor bumper damage (visible in the photos)
	•	Full service history & 12 months MOT

Meanwhile, the 2019 TSI has 2 previous owners and ~40k miles and needs a fresh MOT.

The kangarooing issue with the 1.5 TSI has honestly put me off a bit, since it feels like a gamble. Part of me says to just go for the 2.0 TDI DSG instead and avoid the problem altogether.
