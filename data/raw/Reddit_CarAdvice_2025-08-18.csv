1mt48om,Cannot find root cause of vibration,"Hi All,

Appreciate this could be anything but wanting to hear thoughts or advice before returning to a mechanic. Based in the UK, Hyundai i40 Saloon 2013. 

Context and background is for the past few weeks or month, my steering vibrates massively when braking at high speeds. Got it checked by a mechanic who spotted a bold patch on a rear tyre and a dodgy track rod end front right hand side. 

I had the track rod end replaced, and all 4 tyres changed (part worn), balanced and had tracking. 

Now the vibration has reduced a lot, but hasn't completely gone. There is still some vibration when driving at 60mph even moreso at 70mph.

When braking there is also vibration at higher speeds. 

I will be returning to the tyre place, to ask them to recheck balancing, but if that doesn't solve it, any ideas what to try next? One mechanic said to me there's a possibility it could be the discs, but even he was unsure as he said the brake pedal doesn't pulsate. Although he noticed ever so slight uneven surface on a front brake disc, which he said take it back to the garage that originally did it because I have only covered 9,000 miles and they shouldn't develop a fault so soon(car is used daily, never stood).

Before I do that, I wanted to check it is not anything else, as I know many individuals will not want customers coming back after a period of time, mentioning these issues.

Recently (hard to pinpoint when, but within the last few weeks) my brakes have started squeaking/squealing for the first couple times I brake each morning, and then go back to normal. By the time I am out of my driveway brakes are silent. I think that the sound is coming from my rear brakes (drum brakes) but it is hard to know for sure.

Any ideas what this might be? I replaced pads and rotors on my front brakes in November, but I have not touched my rear brakes in the time I have had the car (about 30,000 miles, three years). I am not sure when they were last replaced. My grandparents (previous owners) might know, but I don't want to burden them with going through years of service records they may/may not have. One of my rear wheel bearings needs a non-urgent replacement, which I have been putting off, put perhaps this noise could be related?

I do as much of my own work as I can to learn about my car and save some cash, so bonus points if this is something I can fix on my own!",1,1755468455.0,3,MechanicAdvice,1755545686,2025-08-17 22:07:35,2025-08-18 19:34:46,"Odd-Concept-6505 (Score: 1): You'll need to pull wheels, maybe even pull calipers off of rotors (front..those disc pads have wear indicators designed to squeak when pad thickness becomes thin)

1mt3qvd,"2011 Chevy HHR - prior repair attempt p0172, p0455, p0300","Hello,
I'm at my wits end on what I need to fix here. 

I did valve cover gasket replacement, AC Delco plugs, new O2 sensor, new MAF sensor, new evap purge valve sensor. 

O2, MAF and evap purge valve came from Amazon. 

Side note on the purge valve - some guides say you can blow through it when it's new. I bought 2 of them and neither were like that before installed.

After all that work, my codes stayed off and car ran fine.

Once inspected, I first got a message on my dash saying check gas cap. Never knew the car could even display that lol.  Anyway checked gas cap, all was fine. Then P0455 popped about a week later.

Next up p0172 came back, then misfires. My obd doesn't tell me which cylinder but on the prior repair seemed like 4th, right most when facing the driver, was the culprit as it had oil on it.

Now when I'm driving at lower speeds, it runs fine. Once I get up around 75-80 is when the misfire happens however not always. 

When it does start to misfire I can smell it, not sure if it's coming through AC but today when it happened I def smelled a gas like odor.

Is this an evap vacuum leak? Where/how should I start trying to fix these issues. I know it's an old car at this point, I'm around 210k but I can't buy a car currently so fix has to happen.

Any tips are appreciated!",1,1755467467.0,8,MechanicAdvice,1755545686,2025-08-17 21:51:07,2025-08-18 19:34:46,"Flaming-Wreck7986 (Score: 2): Stuck open purge valve could definitely cause all of these. Amazon parts are terrible usually, especially an O2, and doubley especially a MAF, both very sensitive and critical sensors to your engines performance. Hope you kept the OEM ones just in case.

Try disconnecting the EVAP line from your purge valve and putting your thumb over the vacuum port while the engine is running. Is it constantly pulling a vacuum? If so, purge valve is stuck open, causing these conditions.

Could try putting your OEM MAF back in if you still have it, see if that changes anything. It's possible the evap leak and running rich/misfire aren't directly related.

Purge valve should be closed without power though - to answer your blow through it question.

Also p0300 is a multiple cylinder/random misfire. So typically that would be something outside of the individual cylinders. Honestly with a multiple misfire condition along with running rich, realistically that's pretty much just going to be a restriction in the intake system, or MAF/O2 giving faulty readings (if it's not the purge valve stuck open)."

Among all the different styles of wrenches that I've seen I think these 2 types are most versatile and complementary each other to cover all the bases for doing basic car maintenance.

\--Double box-end wrenches with fixed & flex ratcheting head

Red oil light on dash = low oil pressure.

No oil pressure means metal parts grinding together make very bad noises and do very bad permanent engine damage if the engine isn't stopped immediately (seconds).   Under high load going up a hill this would happen almost immediately.

No sparkles in oil = oil stopped circulating so the metal bits are not getting flushed out from where they're being created (between the bearings and journals), and thus not into the oil pan where they would normally wash up on the dipstick.

I was driving to the camp ground I was staying at, about 2 hour drive, and it involved going over a mountain pass and then down.   Before I left I checked everything, oil tire pressure all that, everything seemed good.  It all happened on the mountain roadway.  i climbed the  mountain pretty good, car felt great lots of power, but as I was coming down the mountain I left off the gas to coast, and the car downshifted automatically into a lower gear which seemed to help as the engine braking was keeping my speed where i wanted and not gain speed from the steep downhill.  well half way down the mountain all of a sudden I heard this ticking sound, very noticable from inside the car, not so much from outside but its still there.   I sounds like metal clicking and it increases and decreases as the engine rpm goes up and down, also it doesn't seem to be there when there is no load on the engine, like sitting idle but the engine seems to be running with a clunkyness to it, not horrible, but its not 100% smooth, then when I pull away at around 1500 rpm or so the clicking will start again.   So after I first noticed the sound I Drove about 5-10 minutes until there was somewhere safe to pull over.   I noticed the car was lacking power now, not half but it felt almost like I was out 20-30% power.   I pulled over and first thing I did was check the oil because I thought I blew my motor from running it out.   there was oil in it, thou it seemed to be down about half a litre or so but the one thing that stood out was the oil was jet black, and had a slight grittiness to it, like there was fine sand in the oil or something.   i didn't notice any smoke or anything coming out the exhaust and the engine wasn't overheating, so after that I decided to just drive the rest of the way to the camp sight which was about 30 minutes away.  we made it, stayed 3 nights, then it was the long drive home which I was nervous of course.   checked oil before leaving and car was cool and settled, it was down probably about 1 litre.  so about 20 minutes into the drive I stopped and grabbed oil to top it up.   the car made it up the hill and all the way home and nothing seemed to have changed other then its using oil up and the oil is black and that ticking is still there.    anyone know what might of happened?

I wouldn't bother taking this to a body shop.  They're going to want to do it the right way (factory repair), which is going to cost you big bucks in labor and parts because all that rust is going to have to be addressed.  At least a few thousand if not more.

Can you fix the spot yourself?  Yup.  And honestly that's what I'd do.  Get some rust stopping paint like por15 or masterseries and coat everything you can.  Get your piece of metal (also painted) and pop rivet it over the top.  You're just looking to keep debris and critters out of the car, and that's all it will take to do it, and you're into it for less than $100."
1msret9,"2008 Nissan Pathfinder Ti (R51) – Can’t lock the car at all, fob won’t reprogram","Hey everyone, I just bought a 2008 Nissan Pathfinder Ti (R51, 2.5L YD25DDTi turbo-diesel) and I’m trying to sort through some issues. The most urgent problem is that I can’t lock the car at all, but I’ll list everything in case it’s connected.

Background:

	•	Car has been sitting for about a year (previous owner had health issues and wasn’t driving it).
	•	Battery is weak/old (the car does start, but I suspect it needs replacing).
	•	Oil is completely black and needs changing.
	•	Surface rust in a few spots, but nothing major.


Interior/electrical issues:

	•	Center console was replaced by the previous owner, and it’s wobbly. Since then, the AC doesn’t work.
	•	Driver’s window doesn’t go up or down.
	•	Front passenger window also doesn’t work (motor is missing)
	•	Both rear windows work fine.


The main problem (locks/fob):

	•	Remote key fob doesn’t work, even after I replaced the fob battery.
	•	Tried the ignition reprogramming sequence (insert/remove key 6–10 times until hazards flash) but the car never enters programming mode. Hazards never flash.
	•	The immobilizer/security light (red car with a key symbol) just keeps flashing.
	•	The only manual lock is on the front passenger door, but turning the key there only locks that one door, not the others.
	•	I checked all the fuses (both cabin and engine bay) and they’re fine.

At the moment, I can’t lock the car at all… The fob doesn’t work, the only keyhole (passenger door) only locks that door, and there are no manual lock pins inside to push down.

Any advice on where to start? Could this all be linked to the weak main battery, or does it sound more like a BCM/central locking issue?


TLDR: Bought a 2008 Pathfinder Ti YD25 turbo-diesel that sat for a year. Key fob dead (new battery didn’t help), central locking won’t work, car won’t enter programming mode, only passenger door locks manually. Battery is weak but car still starts. Can’t lock the car at all… is this likely just a bad main battery or something bigger?",1,1755438535.0,2,CarTalk,1755545686,2025-08-17 13:48:55,2025-08-18 19:34:46,"thekapitalistis (Score: 2): Doesn't really help your issue of faulty remote system, but isn't there a central locking button/switch on the driver's door, near the window switches?"

Have you checked the recommended wheel width for the tires?

U-Conn (Score: 3): https://tiresize.com/calculator/

Use the comparison tool to make sure the diameters of the front and rear tires are within about 3% of each other. If they are, no issue at all.

The diameter of a tire is calculated by multiplying the tread width by the aspect ratio, doubling that, and adding the rim diameter. For example, a 225/45R20 tire is 225mm wide. The diameter is 2*(225mm*0.45)+20in, which is 28in. Yes, we use mixed units for tire sizes.

Keep in mind, with wider rear tires you’re looking at what’s called a staggered setup. This can be advantageous for a RWD or heavily-rear-biased AWD car for performance reasons (and looks) but eliminates the ability to rotate tires front-to-back."

Those gouges are way beyond the clear coat. The only way to fix it them properly (so it looks OEM) is to sand everything down,  add filler,  and re-coat the entire bumper cover. Not worth it IMO but that's your call. It's not physically possible to fix those gouges without adding filler as they are well through the paint and into the plastic. 

Looks like the previous owner covered the gouges in touch-up paint.  That's what I would recommend for most people.

Edit: took another look at the pic. You might be able to get away with just sanding and re-spray (no filler work) but the chips are too deep to not require paint. The color and clear are gone where the damage is."

Battery - indicates an issue with the battery or battery charging system.

Check engine light - indicates that there is some issue with the car that has been logged by the car's computer.

**Right now the engine isn't running.**

So, since the engine isn't running, the alternator is not spinning, so the battery is not being charged. Thus you may get a battery warning light.

Since the engine isn't running, its oil pump isn't spinning. Since the oil pump isn't spinning, it's not pressurising the oil system. So, the oil pressure warning light could be on. 

Finally, since the engine isn't running, the engine control unit (ECU) is getting weird readings from various sensors, so it throws some temporary codes about those things, causing the check engine light.

**If these warning lights disappear when you start the engine, everything is alright.**

**If they don't disappear, something is wrong. If the oil light doesn't disappear, don't drive and check the owner's manual for an explanation of what it exactly means (whether it's low oil or low oil pressure, with the latter being potentially catastrophic if it's not just a bad sensor).**"

As for cost, shocks aren't terribly expensive if you do it yourself. For a shop to do it, probably a few hundred dollars. Struts can be more expensive.

But you want to have good shocks and struts, if they're worn out, they won't put the proper force down on the tires and you can end up with bad wear patterns and cupping that destroys the tire.

You SHOULD mark the tire, locations on wieght on the face (if present) and then make sure the tire goes back on the same way because that's the orientation that it was balanced in.

As computer-controlled engine management developed, 0-60 times of sports cars dropped into 5-second and 4-second territory.

As traction control systems developed, 0-60 times in the 3-second range became less of a rarity, and now with electric vehicles delivering high levels of torque from 0 RPMs, 2-second 0-60 times are becoming commonplace and 1-second times are the rarity.

There is a weather strip- the rubber piece- that goes around the door opening of the body, and another one around the door. They usually last for years, I don't know that I have heard of one failing but I suppose it could happen. 

Another reason for water in the floor is a leaking heater core. Do you ever notice a sickening-sweet smell inside, and maybe the windshield gets a fog on it that can't really be wiped off? If so, then check out the heater core. 

It may require someone to sit inside the car while someone sprays the outside with a garden hose or a car wash high pressure hose to see if you can detect where it is coming from.

1mt5sna,Should we keep my car or should we sell it?,"Hey r/AskMechanics,

I usually don’t post stuff like this, but me and my wife are in a bit of a pickle! Hoping for some help here. Two years ago, my wife financed a white 2015 Mazda CX-5 (AWD). We got it for roughly $15k in 2023. Last December, she was t-boned, and the cars frame was damaged. Fortunately it is still drivable, but not street legal. 

A few months after us spotting rides from folks, we bought a new white 2015 Mazda CX-5 (FWD) for $15k! Literally the same car, but with the changes in the AWD to FWD. But this time in full. After this, we paid off the full amount left on the 2023 Mazda (roughly 12k left on the balance.) This was a huge bummer to us as we wanted to buy a house and these purchases set us back to around $25k in savings.

What’s been nice about the old and new car is we can swap out parts at a moments notice. We swapped headlight, side mirrors, etc. Funny enough, someone hit and ran her back right (when she got in the t-bone, it was the back left!) door. We still have the old car and swapped the door easy peasy!

What I am curious is, should we buy a garage to store this (we live in an apartment complex without a garage) and keep it as a just incase for parts, OR should we sell the old car? Obviously selling for us is a bit more appealing as we would love a boost to our down payment fund for a house.

Never any issues with the engine or transmission, no signs of them going bad (no jerking, no fluids mixed into the oil, no previous smoke).
I was driving to my mother's house, she lives 19 minutes away. About a mile from her house a light came up on the dash, the red lightning bolt in parenthesis which I later learned has something to do with the throttle body. 
As I was getting off the highway, my van just died and I coasted up the off ramp and pulled off to the side as best as I could. 
I tried restarting the van, it sounded like it wanted to start again, but it just wouldn't get there. 
We jumped the vehicle in case that was the issue. I tried starting it again and smoke was coming up out of the hood from near the radiator. I had it towed home after that, fearing starting it again would cause more damage or start a fire. 
I got home and noticed these 2 black hoses under the van where I usually park. I do have another vehicle that I sometimes park there as well, an 04 VW new beetle convertible 1.8t gls. It doesn't have any issues except the speedometer isn't working, so I don't believe the tubes came from there. 
I also noticed under the hood of my van there's a long silver tube coming out of the alternator, winding in front of the van by the radiator, then taking a 90 degree turn towards the back of the engine. Every connection point looks black, grimy and oily. Van battery is completely dead.
So my questions are-
1) What are the tubes? 
2) does anyone know what possibly caused my van to die while driving, and is it related to the black tubes?
3) what is the silver tube coming out of the alternator?
4) Is it worth even repairing with 200k miles?
5) If it's worth repairing, or possibly a simple fix, what should I do next?

I am able to fix some things on my own. I worked on my VW bug and repaired multiple issues like the power box and cables, redoing old crumbly wiring and converting a rare 9 pin headlight connector to 3 pins, removing the ECU and sending it off, replacing alternator belts, replacing thermostats, simple things like that. I just haven't worked on the van very much.

I’m having trouble with the trunk on my 2015 Audi A3. It won’t open using any of the usual methods. Whether I press the release button inside the car, use the latch on the trunk itself, or hit the button on the key fob. The taillights flash when I try, which suggests the signal is being received, so I don’t think the issue is with the remote or the buttons.

To open the trunk, I’ve had to crawl through the back seat and use the manual release. When I do this, the latch feels like it sticks slightly, which makes me suspect the trunk release mechanism might be faulty. However, after doing some research, I found that a frayed or shorted wire in the wiring harness leading to the latch is a common issue with Audis and could also be the culprit.

Interestingly, the trunk does occasionally open with the button, but it’s rare and inconsistent.

I’m hoping to fix this myself if possible. Is there a way to pinpoint whether the issue is with the latch itself or the wiring without having to buy and install a new trunk latch right away?",1,1755462335.0,3,AskMechanics,1755545686,2025-08-17 20:25:35,2025-08-18 19:34:46,"Far-Library-1624 (Score: 1): See if you can find a tsb relating to rear view camera or tail light wire chaffing.

I’ve got a 2021 VW Passat with about 51k miles. 2.0 & Auto trans. Lately it feels like the car is “dragging” or has some resistance, almost like driving through water. It’s most noticeable when coasting around 25–30 mph. 

Acceleration is otherwise fine and it has no problem getting up to speed, it just doesn’t feel right. Feel it even more if I let off the accelerator. 

What I’ve checked so far:

All 4 wheels spin freely when jacked up, no noise or grinding.

The driver’s front wheel has more resistance than the other 3, but not seized. I read this could be normal since it's fwd? If I spin by hand, it definitely stops faster. 

Spark plugs are fairly new, tires are brand new (issue predate having them changed yesterday), air filter is new. No weird turbo sounds. No codes stored.

So I’m debating whether this is a mild brake drag issue (maybe a sticky caliper/slide pin on the front driver’s side?) or if it could be transmission related. I know these Passats are “lifetime fill,” but I’m right at 51k and I’ve read fluid/filter changes are smart around this mileage.

Anyone with experience  — does this sound more like a brake caliper dragging a little, or is this maybe the torque converter/trans fluid starting to cause that “engine braking” sensation?

deepplane82142 (Score: 1): As someone else had mentioned, this should be normal as the shaft itself is moving all as one unit.

I assume the transmission is automatic. The play you see is a from how the park pawl is designed. I don't have a picture of the park pawl assembly that I've personally taken, but this picture shows how they all pretty much work.

https://preview.redd.it/xtyzpdmpomjf1.jpeg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bed5aefe52b72b68eaab128dc2ae2280ae61c478

Most manufacturers leave a little bit of wiggle room for the park pawl because they would rather allow the car to have 1 inch or less of forward and backward freedom while in park than for the park pawl to get stuck and essentially disable the car by parking.

Edit: ok, I just saw you do state it is manual. Forget the park pawl then, this is still normal levels of play within the transmission. The shaft is fine as you can see when you turn the shaft at the rotor, the inner joint instantly reacts.

Again, manufacturers don't build the tolerances of any transmission to press fit levels of accuracy on most of the moving parts, but close enough that they won't damage each other by simply existing and operating. Gear to gear tolerances are much tighter than the above depicted park pawl, but there are still small clearances present all the way down to the differential."

1msth9u,ACURA MDX Suspension Quote from Meineke Need some advice,"I drive a 2009 Acura MDX and just had an inspection done. The shop flagged a bunch of suspension issues and gave me a pretty steep quote. Before I move forward, I’d like to know if this all makes sense and what (if anything) should be prioritized.  ALSO I am from Cincinnati Ohio. 

# Inspection Issues (Shop Notes):

* **Left Upper Ball Joint Has Play**
   * *Recommended Action:* Replace front upper ball joint.
   * *Notes:* “Your ball joint is loose. If it were to completely fail you may lose control of your vehicle and if not repaired it may lead to additional steering and suspension damage. We need to fix this today for your safety.”
* **Rear Suspension**
   * Rear strut/shock/spring condition flagged (no clear recommendation).
   * Sway bar frame bushings worn/damaged → *Replace rear sway bar frame bushings.*
   * Trailing arm bushings damaged/worn → *Replace rear trailing arm bushings.*
* **Under Car – Fluid Leaks**
   * *Condition:* Engine oil leak.
   * *Recommended Action:* Dye and inspect.
   * *Notes:* “Your engine has a leak. If enough leaks out your engine will be damaged. We recommend fixing this to keep your vehicle running and you safe.”

# Meineke Quote (with Labor & Parts Descriptions):

**1. Remove and Replace Front Lower Suspension Control Arm (BOTH SIDES)**

* **Labor:** Remove and replace front lower suspension control arm (both sides) – **$378.30**
* **Parts:** Suspension control arm and ball joint assembly – **$589.95 each side**
* **Total (w/ tax): $1663.38**

**2. Remove and Replace Stabilizer Bar Link Kit (BOTH SIDES)**

   * Suspension Stabilizer Bar Link (1) – **$159.95**
   * Suspension Stabilizer Bar Link (1) – **$159.95**

# Questions for the Community:

1. Does this work/these issues line up with what’s expected on a 2009 Acura MDX?
2. The inspection note called out the **upper ball joint**, but the quote is for **lower control arms with ball joint assemblies**. Is that a red flag?
3. The parts pricing looks really high (e.g., \~$600 each for control arms, $150–$160 for sway bar links, $290 for trailing arms). Does that sound like OEM parts, or just markup?
4. Would you recommend getting a second opinion from an independent mechanic and/or sourcing parts myself (RockAuto, etc.)?
5. I need to figure out how to pay.. financing etc...

I’d love some perspective from mechanics or other MDX owners before I sink nearly $4,000 into this.

I actually found kits on PARTS GEEK that were CONSIDERABLY LOWER and seemed to include the entire kit BOTH SIDES for LESS than just one of the sides that Meineke quoted.. (which is crazy)

I know these are SERIOUS issues.  (Long back story about this Used car I bought back in May) So I need to figure this out ASAP.  I don't know if this is something I can get my partner to do (or another guy we know who is a mechanic)  My partner is somewhat familiar with cars and did do a total brake job on his Ford F150 but doesn't know about this work.

Any recommedations about how to approach this at a much more affordable manner. I got this quote for FREE but I am wondering if sending this on to other garages for their costs and recommendations.

I have a long trip (2 hours each way) planned in a week's time and haven't been able to get an appointment before then.

The problem is long term, it's always happened like clockwork when I go above 70 or so. I feel it in the wheel and also in the car itself. I asked the place I bought it from the look at it and realign the wheels (as it was like this when I bought it) but I don't know if they actually did anything because the problem is the same. They aren't the most reputable place, to put it lightly, so I doubt they even looked tbh. 

I've driven it liked this a few times but generally tried to stay just below the shaking threshold. But this weekend is a long try and going there at 65mph seems a bit ridiculous. Moreover, I don't want to be on the highway if there's an underlying problem that's dangerous.

Recently, on a road trip, my girlfriend's 2015 Subaru Outback started making a whirring noise whenever the car was moving and the wheel was turned straight or slightly left. When the wheel was turned right, the noise completely stopped. The noise was unrelated to the gas pedal being pushed down and was totally dependent on the speed of the wheel turning. The sound was coming from the driver's side wheel.

A few weeks ago, her grandpa and brother replaced the brakes and brake pads on her wheels.

After taking the car to a mechanic, who is allegedly a family friend, he claimed that the brakes were rubbing against the rotors, which was causing the noise.

Fast forward to this week, he is now claiming that the brakes are actually fine, and the transmission in the car is done. Several thousands of dollars to repair it.

I don't know enough about cars to know if they are getting scammed. Her mother took the car in to the mechanic, which is concerning me because I know there is a tendency for some scummy mechanics to take advantage of women who bring their cars in because they think they don't know any better.

8.  Water pump actually leaking?  Yes


I would address in the following order


Water pump+thermostat+coolant replacement (not a flush) together to keep cost down.  If your water pump goes, your engine is toast if not caught in time.  It can also leave you stranded


Transmission pan gasket and ATF replacement, might want to throw a transmission filter in there too if applicable

I was driving to work and my engine suddenly made squeaking noises. At first I thought something may have got stuck on my wheel, so I pulled over. When I got out, it was coming from under the hood (uh oh..) 

I popped the hood and the squeaking noise was coming from the engine. I suspected it could be a belt or something else. Being unsure, I turned my vehicle off. It wasn’t overheating. I gave it a few minutes then decided to crank it back up and get it out of the road at least. When I tried cranking it, it struggles A LOT. It took a few tries and toggling either the gas pedal to keep it on. It’s almost like turning it off made my issues A LOT worse than they already were.

It cranked up and struggled to keep life without playing with gas pedal some. I didn’t want to do much, because I would hate to cause it more damage if the problem was detrimental. Well, I got it parked at least, but it died and definitely struggled/wouldn’t crank. Checked under the hood once more. I could feel some heat come off engine. It wasn’t showing the vehicle was overheating on my dashboard, but the heat was definitely more prominent than the last time I raised my hood. 

I had my car towed back home. Couldn’t make work today (hour drive). So, I got a lift and went to buy a diagnostic scanner from Walmart Automotive. They only had one, so better than nothing. The reviews showed it was worth the investment. The following codes showed up and I took pictures of them. I’ll post the photos, but just incase they do not post, the order as followed:

I buy a thermostat + housing + cross coolant pipe (all nice upgraded parts.) I tow the car back. I start the car so I can park it, and the engine shakes and bangs for a few seconds and then stops. The engine never shook like that before. I replace the parts. 

Yay, I should have no issues right? Hah, good fucking luck. I had noticed the revs were unusually slow up and down before it was overheating. I look at the throttle body. It's barely opening at all. Only good news is that the engine isn't shaking Another mechanic who happens to walk by as I'm working on my car advises me to replace the air intake sensor. So I replace it with a Mopar sensor and clean the throttle body to remove all the carbon and oil buildup. Throttle body still barely opens at all, absolutely no improvement.

I take apart the throttle body, it seems okay but I guess that the motor is out. I get a new throttle body. I install it. It doesn't open literally AT ALL. And when I remove it there's oil all over the inner side:

1msctoo,What causes these steering noises combined with stiff steering?,"Hi all!

Recently my BMW 116i from 2008 has been starting to produce this sound while steering after roughly 10-15 minutes of driving.

Whenever the car/engine is cold, the car steers normally, no stiffness, no noises. Whenever I take it for a drive, it gradually stiffens up overtime. Which then also decreases again once the car cools off again.

I have checked/noticed the following:  
\- The powersteering is electric, so there's no fluid that needs changing/topping up.  
\- The car battery is fine, voltage is at 14.8 while running, even with AC/lights etc. on, which should rule out a shortage of power to the EPS-unit.  
\- The tires are inflated to the correct PSI.  
\- The steering wheel does always return to it's zero-point when releasing it after turning a corner.  
\- The noise seems to be coming from the steering wheel/dashboard, not further down.  
\- No dashboard lights have started to show up regarding my steering wheel/EPS failing.  
\- The connector to the EPS-unit has been cleaned and checked on how well it's seated and stays seated.  
\- Other parts of the steering mechanism have been lubricated where possible.

I hope these issues ring a bell with someone, my thought is that it's some kind of thermal protection of the EPS-unit..

1mt62g5,Update to my last hated post. Dealership sold 1977 micron filler car.,"Just a follow up post given my last post got quite a bit of hate lol. The reason I care is because the Mercedes dealership was bragging the car was sold new by them, serviced through the life (5 years) with them and sold back to them. This was in response to me asking about some scratches. To which they said they knew the car inside out. Assuring me it was in top condition, apart from some scratches. 

Given its a black car i wanted to get some detailing work done for a 2 or 3 stage polish with some ceramic coating to make it more maintainable. Thats when the detailer did the paint thickness test to see if the paint is in decent condition to do so. A large part of the quarter panel came back with 1977 microns of filler. To which he said. no one would want to machine polish that area as no one is aware of how the paint and filler job was finished. As the machine could cause damage to the filler area. 

This is my frustration as now I feel im limited in detailing options and went with a mercedes approved car for the reason that I thought there would be a better quality check, especially considering them saying they knew this car so well. 

They also claimed 5 full service history with them and only after I paid and went to collect the car they suddenly tell me one year is missing. I also had to chase about log book ownership transfer after 10 days of not receiving. To which it was obvious they forgot to submit.

So couple of frustrations which has added to the above.",0,1755473402.0,4,CartalkUK,1755545686,2025-08-17 23:30:02,2025-08-18 19:34:46,"I_am_feel (Score: 6): You're absolutely milking this, how many subreddits have you posted this to?"

I really like the idea of some sort of electric or hybrid, although we currently live in a flat so home charging isn't an option.

The other issue with the fully electric option is that none of the cars I've seen look particularly appealing. My partner is keen on a VW Passat, which is available as a hybrid or plug in hybrid, but is that just the worst of both worlds?

1msym57,"Help with 5dr hot hatch - Audi S3 / Civic FK8 / Focus ST/RS, etc.","The time has come, and it seems like my 2007 Honda Civic Type S (FN1) is going to need a replacement. We are expecting a baby before the end of the year and my wife wants to move to a car with rear doors, so it's easier to get in and out of the car with the baby, etc.

For most people this would be the time to get rid of the hot hatch and get something more sensible... but hear me out first.

I (34M) WFH 5 days a week, with the odd trip to someone's offices somewhere in the UK, or for an event, maybe like once every 3/4 months. Last few years I've done 3/5k miles for reference.

My wife (34F) has a hybrid schedule (1-2 days in the office), but her commute is basically taking the train to a big city nearby, so she just takes the train. She does not have a valid UK driving licence yet, which is important here.

I may not drive long distances, but I really enjoy driving; always have. I bought the Civic FN1 as my first car in the UK with the idea to keep it for a few years so I could build my NCB and get some reasonable quotes. Then, I'd upgrade to the FN2, the car I always wanted. That was the plan.

It's now 2025 and my 2007 FN1 Civic is still waiting at my door with 120k miles on the clock. It's served me great and never gave me a reason to replace it.

Now I have to replace it, but I still have that itch in me of getting a proper hot hatchback.

If my wife needed to drive we could look at this completely differently and have 2 cars, her reasonable 5dr car and I'd just get an old FN2... but since she doesn't, having 2 cars for me to drive, when I do so few miles, just sounds stupid to me.

Therefore, I've been scouring the net for all the options, and there's quite a few. The problem is that the more research I do, the more pros and cons I add against each of the cars on my list, not getting any further with making any kind of decision.

Since it's going to be our only car, I'm not looking at anything older than 2017 , as I'd like it to be somewhat up to date and last us a few years (I'm used to the reliability of my Civic). Budget would be £20/30k. I prefer manual, but some autos can be considered.

\- My first option was the H**onda Civic Type R (FK8)**. Look-wise you hate it or you love it, and I 100% love how aggressive it looks... but finding units that meet the criteria is not that easy, with most being £25k upwards.

\- Second in my list is the **Audi S3**. Looks nothing like the Type R, but not necessarily a bad thing, as it'd be an easier sell for the wife, and it's still a really fun car. A tad more expensive, but more worryingly, insurance seems to be 2x/3x what others are, and servicing and anything the car needs doing would most likely be more expensive than any other car on the list.

\- **Ford Focus ST**. Plenty of them available, should be cheaper to run than any other car in the list... but at the same time, it doesn't seem to be as good value considering the quality of the interior and that it looks pretty much like a regular Focus.

\- **Ford Focus RS**. The opposite of the ST... there are just a few unmodded RSs available. Should be the best one maintaining value, but not sure if it's a good investment as a daily (even though not used much).

\- **Hyundai i30n** \- Can't seem to find good value units. They are as expensive as the FK8 by the looks of it, and I'd take a FK8 all-day ahead of an i30n (personal preference).

\- **Golf GTI** \- I just don't love Golfs, and although quite popular, they seem to be the more expensive of the Civic/FocusST/i30n group, without having anything better than them.

\- **Peugeot 308 GTI** \- Few units available and, even though the cheapest by far (circa 10k), reading about the headaches with their breaks just puts me off.

There's probably a few more cars in the list like the Cupra Leon or the Megane RS, and although I'm not ruling out any car yet, I'm just not that keen on them at the minute.",1,1755455432.0,27,CartalkUK,1755545686,2025-08-17 18:30:32,2025-08-18 19:34:46,"Tek9293 (Score: 3): Sounds like you want the FK8 and are asking reddits permission 😂 Get the damn civic, it’s arguably the best car on the list anyway.

1msvu4k,What car to chose.,"Hi group.
Me and my partner are looking to buy a second-hand car. The model we are interested in is a Mazda 3 Gen 3 2.0.

Our budged is somewhere around £7-7.5k at max.
One of the cars I found is a 2014 Mazda 3 with 62000 miles on the odo that is priced for £6k from a private seller. I test drived the car, and it drives nicely. There are no awkward noises from the engine or any other mechanical parts. I also had a look underneeth the car, and the rust is minimal. There are a few scratches on the car (which is normal for a car of this age). The MOT history looks good. It only had 2 fails: one due to the break disks being worned out and the other due to the one suspension spring being in bad condition. It has a full service history, but the only concern is that the seller told me the car was serviced at a family mechanic (I suspect that not all the issues were listed on the MOT). This car will come with a full service and a fresh MOT, but no warranty.

The second car is a 2015 Mazda 3 with 17000 miles on the clock that goes for £9k (I know it is £1.5k above the budget). This car is in prestine condition - the interior looks like one from a new car, and the exterior is in the best condition a 2015 car can be. This car would come with a 6 month warranty and a fresh MOT.
We can stretch the budget to £9k but that would leave us with no savings left.

We are both in our mid-20s, we bought a house last year and our combined anually income is £52k

Even though it works fine and has never let me down, it has a noisy and somewhat temperamental clutch, it constantly fogs up if the Aircon  isn't running all the time, and now the Aircon is becoming a bit inconsistent with how cold it is capable of blowing.

I have a family with two small children and the size of the car hasn't been a problem (it's surprisingly roomy).

I have 5 grand to buy a new car, which doesn't feel like a lot these days. And in theory I could keep paying for the Civic's niggles to be fixed/patched over for years to come.

Qweasdy (Score: 3): 95%+ of the time the mileage allowances and excess mileage/damage charges do not matter at all. You don't pay them, it's one of the many big misunderstandings of PCP.

You have 3 options (actually 4 if you include voluntary termination) for ending a PCP deal.

* Just buy the car by settling the finance, paying off any amount you still owe and keep the car. In this case the car is yours and any damage/overmilage isn't any concern of the finance company. You don't pay the mileage charges here.    

* Trade in the car to take a new PCP out on a different car. In this case the dealership is buying the car off of you and settling the finance on your behalf, from the finance companies POV this isn't any different from the first option, they get their money regardless of the condition of the car. The money you receive towards the deposit on your next PCP is the difference between the value of the car and the settlement figure. This is by far the most common option and you don't pay the mileage charges here either. 

* The last option is almost always the worst option for you unless the finance company has made a serious mistake. This is the default ""hand the car back and walk away"" without money changing hands option. This is the only time that the mileage charges actually apply. Almost nobody actually does this, even if you don't want a new PCP and you don't want to keep the car you can still do option 2 and just pocket the difference instead of putting it towards a new car. Yes, you can sell a car that is on a PCP deal though usually only to dealerships, selling them privately is more difficult.

The mileage charges exist solely to protect the finance company from losing money on the car in the event that you manage to put so many miles on the car that its value depreciates below the guaranteed future value and hand it back. If a car has a guaranteed future value of £10k but is only actually worth £9k after 4 years then the best option for you is to just hand it back. The finance company would have lost £1k on that car. 

So the basic calculation the finance company is making to set the guaranteed future value is that ""if the car does less than 8k miles per year and is in good condition then in 4 years it will be worth *at least* X"". If you do more miles than that then they can't guarantee they won't lose money on the car so they include the mileage charges in the terms to protect themselves.

MPG will be slightly less in the 35 given the higher output and X-Drive. Depending on how many miles per year you do along with your driving style, very minimal difference, maybe 5mpg? Not worth worrying about imo. You really need to be doing over 10k miles a year and be doing a lot of motorway driving to make the diesel worth it. Any less and you’ll just be paying more to run it and will likely get the usual DPF/EGR issues that kill any diesel doing mainly short trips. 

Dynamics wise I can’t comment on the specific difference between x drive and RWD, I’ve never driven X drive. I’ve gone from the Quattro system into an M135i and for what it’s worth, on a dry day when I’ve got a nice road to myself the RWD is much more enjoyable.

My arse clenches in the BMW every time I hit some standing water. 

As a daily driver, I’d honestly go for the 35 x drive. A pure rear driven BMW on a nice road is a lovely thing, and I’d love an M2 or M3 as a weekend car.

So, facing a choice here. I need a big car, something that will be a band/gig wagon on occasion and carry wife and baby with all related accoutrements and peripherals. Please don't say buy an electric, already considered and it will not fit. Petrol or diesel only. It also needs to be an auto as the wife has an auto-only license.

First option is to spend £3k max on an estate in cash. There's a few around, I'd select something Honda Accord, VW Passat or Toyota Avensis shaped. Most are very old, at least 15 years old now, and high mileage. I can justify it by saying we don't do mega miles per year but that's likely to change in about 3-4 months for various other reason.

The other option is around £13k worth of people carrier on finance, currently looking at the later generation of Ford Galaxy with the higher up version of the Powershift that didn't self-kaboom at a moment's notice with a 2.0 diesel.

I currently have a 2012 Vauxhall Astra with 83k miles. It's run beautifully and I've only ever had minor issues with it. I think it'll get to 100k and then I'd be looking for a new car.

- Fuel efficiency 
- Value for money
- Comfort
- Everything else

shoopaaa (Score: 2): If you have a good budget like that, you have a lot of options. Selling your astra privately will yield the best result unless you get a decent part exchange offer when looking at another car. A cars value tends to drop off quite dramatically when it approaches the 100,000 mile mark (although after that initial drop, it stays very much the same until around 150K), so 83K or thereabouts is a very good point to sell.

Volvos can indeed tick all the boxes you're mentioning, but there are some caveats to that. Volvos aren't the same invincible, durable machines they used to be. The newer modular 4 cylinder engines are very sensitive to a tight service schedule. Oil needs to be changed on time, every time, and there are some issues present.

2015/16 petrol models had faulty piston rings that made the oil vanish and ruin the engine. Diesels can be quite leaky, and unless you're mechanically sympathetic, the turbos can have an early death.

A very, very sweet spot is Volvos 5 cylinder engines. Whether it's a 2.0 or 2.4 diesel, or 2.0 or 2.5 petrol. These were phased out by 2016 due to emissions regulations and were only used in select models by the end. Generally, very reliable units that made good power, brilliant torque, and reasonable economy. If you can find a 2015 or 2016 volvo with a 5 cylinder and reasonable mileage (don't be too worried about higher mileage), then that would be a car to run into the ground."

backstory, we have a family cx5 which I absolutely love to drive, back in the day I was going to buy a XC60 Volvo, but costs and whatnot scared me away so went with a CX5 and we love it. I read a lot even back about how for Mazda its important that they make fun to drive cars and hell, even our \~2ton is very fun to drive, super reliable, cheap to do maintain etc.

Time has come to buy the MX5. So in my current life situation I have 2 options: I am about to do an exit from our company, which if works out okay, I probably will have 8-14k to buy a ND. In there, I am very undecided because I'd love a hard top, but that is a more targa like while the soft top looks better I think.

2nd option is that my exit doesn't happen or the valution will be trash, but even then I want to get at least an NC Roadster. I like the NC roadster because its both hard top but when its down, its not targa, its a proper cabrio. these ones I see from £800 all the way to £8-10k+

My questions, regardless of the above are, what to look out for and what sort of money can get what (in the UK) ?

Even if my exit doesn't happen as well as I hope I will still want to spend £3-4k at MAX to get an NC Roadster, but around what will that give me? and what to look out for? I know the usual suspects as rust, etc, but what else is there?  
If exist goes well and I can go for an ND, then I ll probably go for a high mileage cheaper hard top or soft top (not decided yet).

The 1.8 has a major problem and that there is a design fault in the engine (something to do with the pistons) which means it eventually starts allowing oil past the pistons and it uses oil like it's gulping it. I would look at the 2.0 instead as it doesn't have this fault and has an LSD as well. 

The £800 ones will be rusted to death, they do rust quite badly, but they rust from the inside so when you see it on the outside it's too late. Fortunately most owners knew about the mx5 rust issues by the time the NC came out and many were well looked after. The £8-10k ones will be the better ones, there are 3 versions of the NC, NC1, 2 and 3, NC2 had visual and engine upgrades and the NC3 had more visual upgrades, I would get the NC2 or 3, better engines and just look a bit better than the NC1, the NC2 came out in in the UK late 2009 (iirc) ao if you look for a 2010-2014 you will get one (the quickest way to know is the grill is more of a smile than an oval).

The ND is fine but as you said, it's not a roadster, they also ditched the 1.8 for a 1.6, early 1.6's also have a big issue and worth ignoring them. Again like the NC, look for a newer ND as they improved them in the later versions.

What's the best way to push for the best deal (I am a cash buyer, but know they prefer finance so how do I deal with this)? Are there any ways to tell if a car is a good one or junk for someone with zero technical knowledge?

I don't want to sound stupid (and I know some will think the questions are), but don't really have anyone to ask as I live on the other side of the country from family and close friends.

Find car you like. Go to dealer. Decide if you really like. Test drive. Agree terms. Take delivery. Drive away.

You will not get a discount for cash. These days there's not much of a discount available regardless of payment method."
1mskykm,Buying a car from Carbase,"Looking at a car we may buy from Carbase, but the annoying extra on top of £300(399?)   
Giving you RAC cover, which you can apparently 'store' waiting for your current breakdown cover to expire.  
Giving you 'access' to an RAC garage for any 'warranty' claims. To me, that's charging you for what you have anyways as a legal standpoint.  
So, basically, they are dressing up their 'admin' fees to sweeten the 'package'

I also heard, they don't negotiate on the price.

Mine was remapped to about 370bhp and was a very quick car for its size and weight. Way more than you'll get out of a 520/530i.

The batteries hardly hold their charge,  i think the range was 30 miles and when you start the car up you lose a few miles straight away and when you drive about a mile or so you lose 5 or so.

Then preferably do a full service and MOT at the same time next MOT

Bonus info is to never take it back to the dealership for MOT/Service. Unless it’s under manufacturing warranty on a new car they will charge you mega money for cheap fixes. (You didn’t clarify in your post so just make sure you go independent garage)

By people who don't care, maybe.

Get the car serviced based on mileage and use.

Get it MOT'd based on time.

Is better to split them.

Ideally looking for a 428i, 430i, 435i, or 440i and personally don’t mind the high mileage if I can find the right deal and if it’s maintained well. Am honestly hoping there will be a post summer increase in stock but we shall see if that pans out.

Also considering to a 430d or a 435d - seems like they can be quite reliable. Attached a photo of what seems like it could be a good fit for what I’m looking for but not super sure what red flags to look for if I go for a test drive.

Currently run checks like carveto, etc… but not really sure what to look out for.
