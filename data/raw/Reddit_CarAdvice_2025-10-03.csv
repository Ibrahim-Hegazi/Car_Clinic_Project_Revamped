Is it leaking coolant or transmission fluid?

The is an o-ring inside the fitting where the pipe inserts.  This o-ring will fail and leak leak transmission fluid.  You'll need a 3/8"" disconnect tool to remove the pipe.  Dorman sells a pack of the replacement o-rings, or you can replace the whole fitting.

There is another o-ring on the threads where the fitting screws into the radiator.  It actually goes into the transmission fluid cooler in the radiator.  If that o-ring fails it would leak coolant, but it's also possible there are micro cracks in the plastic at the fitting leaking coolant as well.  You can remove the fitting with a socket. 

You'll need to disassemble the pipe and fitting to find the real source of the leak.  At least you won't loose a lot of coolant or transmission fluid since it's close to the top.

You will most likely need to replace the radiator if it's leaking coolant at that fitting."
1nwjjli,"Exhaust leak in catalytic converter, should I pay to replace it + exhaust manifold?","Before I go into details, I'm new to driving/cars and I'm trying to learn as much as possible about my car, especially since it got pretty messed up in the last week lol.

Ive been driving a ford 2012 escape and its been great until I hit a rock on a dirt road last week. It ended up crushing a hole into my front exhaust pipe and breaking the O2 sensor. I just got that fixed at the mechanic but as they were putting in a new pipe they noticed that the impact of the rock shifted the position of the catalytic converter and created a crack somewhere (I think the cat) for exhaust to leak out. The cars a lot louder now when it starts up but the guy says as the engine/metal warms up, itll fill the crack up and the car will be good to go. But another guy told me you might want to avoid idling so my car doesnt fill up with gas soo I'm not sure which guy to believe. 

The initial cost was $650, but to completely fix it (cat and manifold) its another $1600. So in my eyes that's crazy and I'm not sure if I want to pay that.

But I'm wondering how bad this damage really is for the car, does it contribute to overheating, misfires, etc and is it worth it to get it fixed? Also is there a short term solution I can try to get me through the winter? The winters are really tough where I'm at and I just want to make sure I can reliably get from place to place.

Anyways, this is my 2017 Nissan Altima with the 2.5 Liter 4 cylinder engine. It’s got 205k miles on it currently. As far as I’m aware these are the original plugs that came in the engine as I bought it at around 50 to 60k miles and have never had them changed. 

Just wanted to take a moment to stop and ask how these spark plugs look? Are there any tell tale signs that these have that may give me some sort of indication of the engine health?

 test to see if you have a head gasket leak..
 cold engine.. remove radiator cap.. place a piece of saran wrap over the filler neck.. push a depression into the saran wrap.. seal in place with a rubber band..  squeeze the upper hose to verify the depression pops up and goes back down..

 start the cold engine for 15 seconds.. shut off. the depression should not pop up within that time..
 the only pressure in the cooling system comes from expanding coolant as it heats up.. this gives you an idea if the head gaskets are leaking or the combustion chambers are cracked..

I drove it during highschool 5-6 years ago and now I’m using it again on a daily basis since graduating college in the spring. Looking to buy a new car but for now it’s my old gal. It’s always ran well besides some exhaust and starter issues and other things that come with an old car.

Now to my question… recently I’ve been driving and when I’m going anywhere between 0-30 mph, it makes a squealing/whining noise from what sounds like the passenger side front wheel. It squeaks going over bumps and stuff and handles like a worn in car, but this new sound is a constant whining noise when on flat ground. The sound usually halts when I take a left turn, which I found interesting. Another thing is that it doesn’t happen all the time, just at what seems like random. If pitch matters, it’s lower than that of a squeaky braking (that of which the Altima also exhibits lol). Sounds like metal on metal for sure though.

Just looking for some security when I drive and I wanna make sure no one thinks it’s too concerning. I have some friends who are into cars that can take a look but I don’t have a lot of time.

1nw9pv4,"2023 RAM 1500 bighorn 3.6l V6 #5 cylinder failure, new cam kit has turned into potential need for a new engine.","I have a 2023 RAM 1500 bighorn 3.6l V6 pentestar engine. I drive a lot, 50 miles one way to work. Currently the truck has 62,000 miles. Last week it misfired on the highway, check engine light flashed, I had it towed to the dealer. They diagnosed it (apparently this issue is common with this engine) and said it needed a cam kit, roughly $2,300. I have to pay it because it’s over the 60k mile powertrain warranty. I said fine go ahead.
NOW they say they recommend a whole new engine because when they took the top off there was “sludge” all over the engine, as they put it. I looked at their photo and it does have a lot of varnish and minimal soft sludge deposits in the corners and stuff but no heavy baked on crazy amount of actual sludge. I had them:
Check the oil pressure-it’s normal, great sign.
When they removed the oil filter and drained the oil the filter had a lot of tiny metal flakes, not big chunks, the oil they drained had a few, like a pinch of salt worth, of tiny flakes, again not big chunks or anything. 
I didn’t always change the oil right when it said to because I work so much sometimes it took a little while to get around to it, but I did change it. (it was a lease under warranty, that’s why I didn’t just do it myself) 
My question is:
-Should I do the cam kit repair for $2,300, park the truck and drive it a little bit once a week while changing the oil and filter every couple weeks then turn it in in 8 months and be done with it?
-or should I pay the $8k-$15k for a new engine on a truck I’m going to be returning in 8 months? 
-I’m assuming the tiny shavings in the filter are top end only from the rocker and cam failure
-and with good oil pressure I would think oil is still getting where it needs to be.
-I’m leaning towards the $2,300 cam kit and parking it, driving it once a week and changing the oil and filter often. Then turning it in in 8 months.
-also, It’s 2 years old, even with 62k miles, and even if I only changed the oil a few times, I find it hard to believe the whole engine just took a shit.

Sorry it’s long, thanks for any advice.

1nw94ic,2003 Ford F-150 overheating.,"
Hi Guys. I need your sage wisdom and advice.


2003 F-150 4.2L V6 Manual Transmission 4x4 



I got this truck 12 years ago at 80k miles. It's now at 200k, and so far it has never had a problem with temperature. I warms up nicely and stays right in the middle.



About a week ago, I was driving slowly on a gravel road, when the temp-warning light came on. The temp gauge was pegged on hot. I pulled over and popped the hood. It didn't seem very hot to me. The upper radiator hose was hot, but touchable. The coolant reservoir was ambient temperature. The coolant level was a bit low, and oil was a bit low. I limped it a few miles home to let it cool all the way down.



I topped off the coolant and the oil, and went for a test drive. The needle just kept climbing, so I took it home to cool off again. This time I noticed that the upper radiator hose would continue to get hotter as the motor cooled off, and the lower radiator hose was ambient temperature. That one never warms up no matter how hot the other one gets.



So now I believe the coolant is not ever circulating. The cheapest and fastest assumption I can make is that the thermostat is stuck closed. Spinning the fan by hand seems to feel correct. Not too much resistance, not too little. I drive my other car to town and buy a new thermostat and gasket. When I got home and pulled the old thermostat out, I noticed how different the new one looks. It has a smaller shoulder than the old one on the housing side, and a different plunger flange thingy on the motor side. My first instinct was to go back to town and find an identical one. Instead, I got on google and went to all the auto parts websites. Every single thermostat across the board (for this exact make and model truck) looks like the new one, except the motorcraft brand.




So then I start to wonder, logically, how many of the differently shaped ones have been installed by other people. Hundreds of thousands? If they didn't work, they wouldn't be handed out as the default replacement, right? If only the motorcraft functioned, everyone would already know. The bigger shoulder on the motorcraft is a perfect slip fit to the thermostat housing. All others flop around like a hotdog in a hallway. I decided to go with it. Install the one I bought, and try to do a stellar job of making sure that it's sealed.



Next day, coolant still does not circulate. I begin to wonder if there is a massive air pocket somewhere. Removing the reservoir cap always feels like its depressurizing, so I assume it's all sealed. The internet suggests parking up a hill with the cap off, running the heat on high with minimal blower speed, and letting the engine warm up. Supposedly that will get all the air out. Nothing happened.




Now I started thinking the water pump is dead. I decide to take it off before buying a new one, and I might as well install a motorcraft thermostat while everything is taken apart, just to be on the safe side. I get the water pump off, and the damn impeller blades look brand new. Zero corrosion. The bearing spins nicely, very smooth. If the belt was turning the pulley (which it was), this baby was definitely moving some water. Now I don't want to buy a new one. Especially considering that the little heater pipe, or whatever you call it, is so perfectly pressed into the top and sealed so nicely. I don't want to fight it out of the little hole, destroy the o-ring, and fight it into a new one. It looks to be in great condition.



I'm at a crossroads. The only thing I know for sure is that I'm going to buy a motorcraft thermostat. That being said, I still want to know your thoughts from someone that understands and has experience with this thermostat enigma.



Please, if you dont mind, give me suggestions on what could be preventing coolant circulation if the old parts were actually fine. Guide me. I have plenty of time and money, but I am not a mechanic. I'm a machinist/manufacturing engineer. I definitely won't do anything as stupid as blowing the head gasket. It hasn't gotten anywhere near that hot, and I won't let it. If all the discussion that we have here does not lead to success, I will take it to a shop, but I want to win. School me.



TLDR;


1. Why are there 12 options for a thermostat, and only one brand fits?


2. Do the other 11 even work?


3. Hypothetically, what would be the likely cause of coolant not moving, if the thermostat and water pump were good?

This prevents it from being pushed backwards into the tiny passages of the ABS valves. Few techs do it this way, but it is the correct method. Worn out brake fluid causes internal corrosion. That corrosion and particles from degraded rubber hoses fall to the lowest point, which is the bottom of the brake caliper bore. How often does it get pushed up into the ABS valves? Rarely. But when it does, it can be very difficult to remove and can turn a simple brake job into a very labor intensive or costly job.

1nw5uc4,What should I do? I’m getting conflicting answers about my car,"Last month I took my car (2009 Toyota Camry LE, 2.4L engine) to one of those quick lube places to get an oil change. I know they can be sketchy sometimes, but I have limited options being in an extremely small town (3,000 people), since my local mechanic doesn’t do oil changes (and we don’t have many mechanics in my town to begin with) and they’ve always had good reviews online, fair prices, and have done good work without trying to tack on unnecessary extra charges. So, I guess what I’m trying to say is I trust them. But, anyway, when I took my car in, they did their usual inspection and got my oil changed as usual. Whenever you bring the car in to get worked on by them, they email you a condition report after. It said my right front wheel bearing needs replaced because it was moving excessively, my left front axle needs replaced, as well as my front lower motor mount. They also sent me a video, which I’ve included in the post. 

So, I asked how bad things were and if my car was drivable, and they said it was fine for now but when it starts making noise, that’s when you know things are bad. They also recommend I replace things in order of wheel bearing, axle, and then motor mount. But, they don’t do that type of work there, so I took it back to my local mechanic that usually does the work on my car. However, he was confused why I was bringing in my car to get the wheel bearing replaced when it was fine. He asked me where my car was making noise, and I said it wasn’t making noise to me, I was just told that it needed to be replaced for excessive movement. But, according to him, 
 both the wheel bearings AND the motor mounts were fine, it was just both of the axles that needed to be replaced. So, in the end, that is what I did. 

I then told this story to my boyfriend’s friend, who is a diesel mechanic but has worked on cars, and he said to him, from the video that the quick lube shop sent, it looks like the motor mount is pretty bad. 🙃 At this point, I just don’t know what to do. I know nothing about cars and I’m getting 3 different answers from 3 different people. So I was hoping maybe you all here could give me some advice. I’m worried about driving my car long distances if I need to replace more stuff, but I’m also worried about getting scammed out of my money. Although, I don’t know why the quick lube shop would tell me something is broken for money when they don’t do that kind of work anyways. Please help!!!

1nw9wu8,diagnosing advice?,"Hi, i have recently purchased a 2013 Mini Countryman Diesel Auto around 3 weeks ago. 

On two occasions since buying, it has gone into limp mode for around 5 seconds when moving off from being stationary (once at a roundabout, and once at a junction). The revs won’t go past 1, for around 5 seconds, and then the car seems to resolve it self… almost like it needs to “catch up”… car doesn’t require turning on/off. On both occasions, the diesel has been low (not sure if this is a relevant factor but worth noting) 

I had AA out to look at the car, and they found 14 error codes - but nothing relating to the transmission. I don’t believe it to be a transmission error as the car otherwise drives fine and has no fault when moving into park or reverse etc.

Can anyone help with diagnosing the car, local garages don’t want to touch it with it being under a warranty company.

After cleaning, thoroughly rinse the terminals with clean water and dry them completely. Finish by applying a preventative measure like petroleum jelly or an anti-corrosive spray to protect against future buildup.

Good on you for not trying to sketch it and just roll back the odo with some sketchy tool off AliExpress. You're actually doing it right.  That 34–37km/h sound. Normalish for newer Kias. Some of those small transition noises are just part of how the CVT or trans behaves at certain load points. If it’s barely noticeable and doesn’t get worse, it’s likely just normal system noise.

  
But yeah, don’t fully trust the “all good” from the dealer if you still hear it. Keep a log/video just in case it worsens. Some people get around this by installing the cluster as-is and just putting a sticker/disclosure inside the glovebox with old mileage that’s legal too but if the mismatch bothers you, getting it programmed is the cleanest fix. Also, if you're worried about more electrical weirdness coming later on because Chevy you might look into something like CarShield or a decent extended warranty once this is sorted. Not magic, but it can help avoid another big surprise later if your BCM or sensors act up. Just read the fine print, don't assume they cover everything. You’re doing it right. Don’t use mileage tools yourself. Let a certified shop reprogram the cluster, get everything in writing, and you’ll be in the clear legally and mechanically.

The tensioner spring is an automatic tensioner so should in theory be the right tightness. Could be that tensioner isn't on straight, bearings on some of the pulleys need to be checked or belt just isn't seated properly.

This means the computer sees the equivalent of a broken wire. 
So the ‘vent valve’ is either unplugged, the coil inside the unit failed, or the wires between the two are damaged. 
Locate the valve, check to see if its unplugged, if not, unplug and plug it back in again, then check the service manual for specs on the internal resistance of whatever pins they want to check, if its out of spec, replace the part. If its in spec, check continuity of the wiring between that plug and where it connects to the ecu/ecm.

1nw813g,Rav 4 issue.,"
Good day gang.

 

I have issue with a car I would like to get the hive minds opinion on. This one has us stumped and has been a conversation with a few of us in the shop.

Car is an 18 Toyota Rav4 AWD LE with about 167K km on it. It has been in and had (But noy all at the same time): Front brakes complete, rotors, pads and calipers, front strut assemblies, lower control arms, stabilizer links and bearing hub assemblies.

It was aligned prior to the bearings and control arms, but it will likely go on the rack again in the next few days.

The problem we have with it is a weird rubbing noise coming from the front/right side of the car.

-It is definitely rotational. When you hear it, it occurs in time with tire rotation.
-It only happens when it is cold, (Not been running for at least an hour or two).
-It goes away within a few min of driving.
-Sound is not worse or better when full cornering either direction.
-Noise might be more noticeable when rocking the wheel back and forth at slow speed.
-Noise is still present when the vehicle is rolling and slipped into neutral.

Stuff we have checked:

-Axels, visual on the inner and outer boots look surprisingly good for 167K. guessing car has done mostly highway miles
-Put a dial gauge on the new rotors. No warp or incorrect machine runout observed. 
-Axels are firm in their pockets, no clicking or unusual movement.
-Bearing torque spec double checked.
-All suspension and subframe bolts double checked to spec and locktite applied where applicable.
-Brake dust shield has been checked (repeatedly). No rub marks visible.
-Tires and wheels inspected, no unusual rub or scraping marks visible.
-Temperatures on wheel hubs checked after driving. Results at 100 +/- 10 on the rears and 120 +/- 10 on the fronts. Well within expectations.
-Struts. Pulled strut, check insulators on both top and bottom, checked dust boots, checked upper support. Inspected strut tower and both upper and lower mounting points/bolts. All passed inspection.
-Inspected Tie Rods. No unusual movement, joints are tight and secure.
-Tires have been rotated, no change.
-Output shaft seals all visually checked with no leaks or damage observed.

Our next suspect is likely going to be the steady bearing or axel support, whatever you choose to call it. There is no growling or clicking that would make us suspect the bearing itself, but as far as rotational stuff goes, we are running out of things to check.

So, anyone have any thoughts?

Mcdavis6950 (Score: 3): I would start by doing the following:

Check condition of battery clamps and follow the large wiring to the starter/alternator.  Pay close attention to the ground cable and make sure it’s not loose or corroded.

Next check the ground strap to the engine.  Never worked on a truck like yours so not sure where it would be.

If all that checks out, verify the output of the alternator at the back.  If you see only 12.4 volts (or the same as your battery) then you need to make sure your exciter wire (small gauge wire to the alternator) has battery voltage present.  

If it does not you should make up a small jumper wire of the same gauge wire and manually supply 12 volts to the exciter terminal and see if the batteries start charging.  You will hear the engine load up a bit and a whistle sort of noise start to come from the alternator if you can’t test and jump terminals at the same time.

I can only assume it is not a self exciting alternator but if it is there is a way to reexcite them if the have been sitting for a long time which you can look up online.

If no voltage present you need to figure out why it does not have power.  

Does your battery light illuminate on the dash?  That is a dead giveaway that circuit is compromised if the car is not charging but there is no light on the dash.

After that you could probably safely light the car on fire because I’m almost certain you will have stumbled across the problem.

Lastly, as a short tidbit… resistance and continuity tests aren’t effective on circuits of this size.  A single strand of copper will show perfect continuity because the tester is running in milliamps.  To properly test this circuit you need to have a load applied.  Test light works better than a meter for times like this."

I called a mechanic and asked them to go over the car and replace everything it needed before I started daily driving it. I just moved to a new town and decided to give my local mechanic a try since I can just walk to the shop to pick the car up once it’s done.

Well after a week and half, they replaced the MAF censor, the fuel filter, radiator, and gave it an oil change. I picked it up and started driving it around as normal, and decided to take it to the car wash.

The car kept stalling at every stop light when it was idling, which was an issue I specifically asked for them to fix. So, that was annoying.

Then, continuing to the car wash, the car died again, but this time it wouldn’t start. The car started smoking and it broke down in the middle of a busy street. I actually had to call 911 to block traffic so I wouldn’t get hit.

Well I go and pop the hood and guess what? THEY NEVER REFILLED IT WITH COOLANT. Because there was no pressure in there to send to the gauge, the car looked like it was cold so I had no idea it was hot. 

So my question is, how screwed am I? Is the engine toast? Did I warp the heads, blow a head gasket?

1nwi6sy,Trying to Buy a 2018 Forester: Dealer vs Mechanic Dilema,"After looking for many cars and a bad experience with an older sales guy trying to coerce and mislead me (that’s a different story), I found a car I liked from All Wheel Drive Motors, and independent car dealer in CO that specializes in Subarus. I am thinking about getting a 2018 Subaru forester 2.5i limited with 88,000 Miles, for $14,000. It has a decent car fax maintenance history other than minor cosmetic damage and no transmission or diff fluid serviced. - Somthing I’m planning on doing if I get it. It’s also got “new” (meaning replaced at some point in 88,000) control arms, spark plugs, stabilizer bar, rear control arm bushings (weird to only do the back?), sway bar links, and A/C condenser, and Brakes but they are low already. 

I test drove it and set up an appointment to get a pre-purchase inspection from Christian Bros.

They said they found some big problems with these being the main concerns: 
1) A Camshaft Carrier Leak, 
2) Leak from the front differential hosing, part of the transmission. *see photos.
3) Bad control arm bushings in the front. (Oddly enough I didn’t feel shaking or vibrating on my test drive.)
4) Torn cv axle boot.
5) corroded battery (less important)


The dilemma is I took it back to the dealer’s mechanic and gave him the report, he first said he was surprised (I know, suspicious) and that he thought the CAM carrier leak was actually a valve cover gasket leak and that the leak of the transmission near the differential hub was just a sweat of gas and nothing to worry about. He said he has seen some misleading reports form Christian bro’s in the past and was wondering if the photos they took were legit. (also sus). 

He wanted to look at the car because he would be “disappointed if the car got on the lot like that.”
He looked at it himself the next day and confirmed the problems, (expressing his disappointment) other than the problems he thought were different diagnosis. He called me and told me he would fix most of the problems that came up “red” in my inspection, except the bodywork ofc. (I’m still waiting for his work order to confirm which exact things they are doing.) 

I called Christian Bro’s and told them what the other mechanic from the Dealer said and I found out both are supposedly Subaru specialists. So even if they aren’t lying I’m not sure why they think the roots of the problems are different. 

I am finding it difficult to trust either place. I don’t know if Christian Brothers has a motive to fluff a report and of course I am always suspicious of what the dealers say even if they seem to be nice people.

Christian bro’s agreed to have the same mechanic double check the work the dealer’s shop is supposed to do for a lesser rate than a full inspection. So I’m thinking about taking it back when they fix it maybe.

I just wanted more opinions on the problems and overall shape of the car. 

I am a lower paid teacher, so this could be a good deal if I get to the bottom of this dilemma, but i definitely don’t want to get ripped off but having a problematic car ofc. 

Advice please?

Took it back to Honda dealer. I’m pretty sure what advisor said was when the oil was being drained into the pan they used a filter and not a funnel. He said technically they should have used the funnel. He said there was oil on the subframe and that is where it splattered. 

My husband said I misunderstood and have no idea what I’m talking about. He said they only use a funnel when they are pouring the oil in from the top. That part I know because I’ve done myself on other cars. He says it was poured in from top with no funnel and it spilled onto the subframe. I’m pretty positive the advisor said when they were draining it into the pan which I assume that would be the old oil. 

So basically my question would be do they use a funnel to drain oil out of the car? How would the oil splatter into subframe?

Sounds like they splashed some oil on the subframe that runs under the oil filter and didn't clean it off well enough and it dripped in your garage."

On two occasions since buying, it has gone into limp mode for around 5 seconds when moving off from being stationary (once at a roundabout, and once at a junction).

1nwfhoq,Update to my last post about switching companies.,"For anyone curious this is my last post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanic/s/aTyE3cFk8U

So here's a update, my boss asked me to come to his office because he knew I already did two interviews at competing shops.

He asked about the pay rate, responsibilities and such. I didn't give him any names of the shops I'm interviewing with due to my concern that there may be an attempt for sabotage my chances.

I used my trade school professors as references and my shop foreman and journeyman.

So anyways he sat me down apologized for his past behaviour and apologized for the service advisors behaviour. He told me he went to a meeting with corporate and he asked if he could give me a raise to keep me here. He said he could offer me the 40% more if I promised to stay and sign a new contract.

He did state that he can't promise that I won't have to train new techs, that was a one of my demands because this shop has been hiring some fuckass people in the past.

So he's giving me (if I accept) a 40% raise now, the promotion will come later in February when I'll be a tech on the mechanical side, drive up and tune ability and a supervisor of the new hires (don't want this)

I asked for everything in writing, the new contract should be ready Friday and I'll be waiting to see it, he asked me not to tell anyone yet because senior techs that have been there are making what I'm making and giving me a raise would mean they'd demand one as well or quit and they've already lost too many people.

So yeah I guess I'm waiting, the other shop already offered me the job, I asked them to give me until Monday to decide, I have three more interviews tomorrow with dealerships.

1nwaow0,Price Quote for Brake Pad and Rotor Replacement,"Hi, I have a 2022 Toyota Camry. It's my first car and I need to get my brakes replaced for the first time. So I do not have much idea about servicing.

I went to Mavis and an local independent shop. Both suggested I would need to replace the rotors as well. Mavis quoted around 850$ for pads and rotors for both axles and the independent shop quoted $1100. Mavis also said the brake fluid needs to be replaced which would be additional $100 but the local mechanic said it doesn't need to be replaced. 

Is this accurate? The quote from Mavis is cheaper than the independant mechanic even after adding the brake fluid. Would there be a difference between the parts or quality of work between Mavis and the local shop? Should I get a quote from another local mechanic?

I called 2 dealerships. They quoted \~$800 for just the pads and they would resurface the rotors. Can the rotors be resurfaced or would they recommend replacing them once you get into the shop? Replacing rotors at dealership would be $1300 total. 

Another question is - is it normal to need replacing pads, rotors and fluid at 48k miles (4 years)?

Any insights would be appreciated. Thanks.",1,1759427260.0,11,AskMechanics,1759519967,2025-10-02 17:47:40,2025-10-03 19:32:47,"Wide_Recording_8462 (Score: 2): I feel like most places now just replace rotors (instead of resurfacing), as they are just so widely available.  A quick search on RockAuto will show about $80-90 per axle for pads and rotors (they come in a “kit”, 2 rotors and the pads).  So figure maybe $300 for parts with the shop markup (probably more, to be honest).  

The thing about car repair nowadays is that, yes, I could do the job on a Saturday in my garage with some YT videos.  But not everyone wants to do that, or has the tools, the confidence, etc.

The shop is a business.  They have to pay employees, the mortgage, etc.  hence the high cost.

48000 miles seems pretty early for a common FWD car.  Under normal driving conditions (not super hilly area, easy on the brake pedal, no towing, etc) you’d expect the rear brakes to last 100k miles.  Maybe the front axle needs service, but I don’t see the rear axle needing service.

You should ask why the rear needs replacing.  They should be able to show you the brake pad wear, i.e. how thick the pad is.  There are minimum mm measurements.  But if the brake pad is still as thick as say a piece of bread or a Doublestuf Oreo, they don’t need replacing.
 
Your owners manual should tell you when to replace brake fluid.

Hope this helps

runningducks13 (Score: 1): This has become a touchy subject, but you very likely do not need your rotors resurfaced and most certainly do not need them replaced yet unless they are warped for some reason or another (seized caliper heated it up or strong impact to the rotor). Resurfacing your rotors is only necessary if there are grooves or uneven wear from a brake pad or debris issue. Otherwise, resurfacing just diminishes the life of your rotors. To understand this, look at the purpose of rotors. Your rotors give your brake pads something to grab ahold of to stop your car. As the pads grab ahold of your rotors, both your rotors and pads will start to wear down. If there are grooves or uneven wear in your rotors, the braking power could be reduced which would be a safety issue. However, this is unlikely to occur. Unfortunately, some shops nowadays will refuse to replace your pads without also resurfacing your rotors. You can tell them all you want is new pads and you should be fine.

If your braking feels spongy or takes a bit to respond to your breaking, then 100% have the fluid flushed. Otherwise, it likely isn’t essential but it isn’t a bad idea either. After all, breaking is the most important safety feature for you and others on the road. Also, a flush shouldn’t cost too much - about $100 plus or minus some.

In all, I would expect a pad replacement to be $300-$400 for both axles/all 4 wheels. Add another $100 for the fluids and I think you should be sitting at $500 or so. There are also regional differences. It could be more based on your location.

Also, are you a female? The unfortunate reality is many shops see a woman walk in and assume they can get away with a high price because “she won’t know any better.” If that is the case, you could try having a male counterpart request the service over the phone.

Hope this helps."

1nw7d2p,issue with repairs after vehicle stolen - please help,"please bear with me with this story but any and all advice is needed. 

about two months ago my car was stolen and then recovered 2 days later. after recovery, there were some issues that needed fixing but it didn't seem to be anything detrimental. the side of the car (back passenger) was hit, the roof console with the sunroof/lights was ripped out & overall some scratches and dents. the insurance adjuster went out etc etc and 2 months later i got my car back. 

upon getting the car back i realized my tire was going flat, which was obviously odd, but i thought it was sitting for 2 months and i'd put some air in them. The next day my tire was completely flat. I discussed it with the insurance adjuster, who said i could bring it to the dealer instead of getting it towed to the other shop. since the dealership is just down the road, i put more air in the tire (runflats) and drove it there. upon driving it there, the back of the car was making a horrible noise (seemingly the tire) and the braking was pulsating and really odd. i assumed this was all due to the tire. I went in expecting there to be an issue with it and only needing to replace that. (the tire going flat is the tire where the car was hit) 

now, the dealer is telling me that actually this is because my front brakes are warped, and the reason the tire is going flat is because i need a new tire valve, my rear brakes are worn and need replacing and my front tire needs replacing as well. 

prior to the car being stolen i have had NO issues with the car whatsoever, and it has been sitting in the shop for 2 months. I am fine with some of this being considered personal maintenance & wear/tear but i'm having a hard time understanding how none of this was brought up to me by the original shop. if my brakes were fine prior to the car being stolen, how has this happened? i have put less that 10k miles on the car in 2 & a half years, all maintenance has been taken care of prior to the car being stolen.

No insurance company or repairer is fixing EVERYTHING and so they address the obvious and the rest is your problem.


This is why most people don't want stolen cars back and insurers are happy to just pay out and sell the car as salvage to avoid the hassle


You could claim you have found additional issues you believe relate to the theft and your insurer might consider those maybe but this really is an endless battle now

1nvwccl,"[Help] 2011 Kia Picanto 1.0 Kappa (G4HE, Manual) – Persistent RPM Drops Between Gears Despite All Fixes","Hey everyone,

I’ve been chasing a weird drivability issue on my **2011 Kia Picanto 1.0 (G4HE, Kappa engine, 3-cylinder, manual transmission, \~69 hp)** and could really use some insight from people who know these small Hyundai/Kia engines.

# The Problem

* When I’m driving and **press the clutch to shift (especially 1st → 2nd)**, the **RPM drops below normal idle** and then bounces back up.
* It’s much less noticeable in 3rd gear and higher.
* At a standstill, idle is generally stable.
* With **A/C or ECO mode ON**, dips are *slightly better*, but they’re still there.
* With load OFF, dips feel worse.

# Work Already Done

Here’s the laundry list so far (so please don’t say “clean the throttle body”):

* ✅ **Correct battery installed (DL55)** → old one was wrong size, voltage now stable at \~14.1–14.4 V.
* ✅ **Throttle body cleaned and even replaced with a new one.** Multiple idle relearns performed.
* ✅ **Idle learning procedure** done by Kia dealership (scanner + reset). No change.
* ✅ **Clutch pedal position switch replaced** (old one faulty).
* ✅ **PCV valve replaced.**
* ✅ **Brake booster/vacuum lines checked → all good.**
* ✅ **MAP + IAT sensor cleaned.** (This car doesn’t have a MAF.)
* ✅ **Upstream O₂ sensor tested good.**
* ✅ **Fuel injectors ultrasonically cleaned + ran fuel injector cleaner.**
* ✅ **No warning lights, no stored codes, no misfires under load.**
* ✅ **Grounds checked, battery → chassis/engine good.**
* ✅ **Cooling fan/brake booster ruled out.**

# What the Logs Show

I’ve logged OBD data while driving:

* **Throttle % closes too quickly** on clutch-in, no visible “dashpot hold.”
* **RPM undershoots idle target** then bounces back (classic dashpot undershoot).
* **STFT spikes lean** during dips, but MAP stays steady → not a vacuum leak.
* **Voltage stays stable** around 14 V, even with A/C and fan on → not an alternator drag issue.
* At idle, car is stable. **The dips only happen while rolling / shifting.**

  
TL;DR

2011 Kia Picanto 1.0 Kappa (manual) dips below idle between 1st–2nd gear shifts.  
Not a misfire, not a vacuum leak, not a sensor. Already replaced PCV, clutch switch, throttle body, did injector cleaning, new battery, O₂ sensor tested good, idle relearn at Kia — **still dips**.

Instead, look further towards the back of the vehicle, behind the oil pan (which you identified correctly) and the transmission.  The big black (and rusty) piece of metal is the front subframe.

It’s not ideal and may have increased engine wear, but the worst case from this scenario is head gaskets, then usually seized engine (if you didn’t notice head gaskets lol). 

Generally, as long as you’re moving, fans don’t do anything that the wind isn’t. If you idle a long time at stop lights it can start warming up, but usually a few minutes is okay and it cools off when you’re moving. 

Just gotta fix it up and see what happens. If it’s felt fine, no coolant loss, not driving weird, good on oil change, you might have gotten lucky and come out fine. 

Oil is really the primary coolant in an engine and if it’s good brand of good clean recently changed it can easily deal with some minor overheating. After doing so an oil change to be safe, the oil ‘wears down’ as it does ‘work’ like this.

CharmingElevator7986 (Score: 1): Depends on your climate in your area, your driving habits, and how long you let it idle before driving. Usually your car will almost always over heat without the fans running after a significant period at idle. Best case scenario is your driving at night when it's cool on the highway.Then the outside temperature being cold would help cool the radiator down along with the coolant which means a cooler engine. If the engine overheated and is ""cooked"" then you should look for signs of a blown head. Check the coolant reservoir inside for brown or black sludge. If nothing catches your eye,you can check the coolant reservoir to see if exhaust gasses are passing through with an exhaust gas coolant reservoir test kit at your local auto parts store. Head gasket leak can also result in oil spots where parked and poor engine idle and performance. Various symptoms can occur but these are more common."

The engine ended up going bad after about a year of driving. He got it replaced by his mechanic (who is usually pretty good at getting things done). The mechanic put a 2004 civic engine in. Not sure if the year makes a difference. Anyway I have no idea where the engine came from so not sure if it’s a complete junk of an engine. I didn’t really start driving it more regularly till maybe 3-4 months ago. After the first oil change, maybe a few weeks after, I checked and seen that oil was not the color it should be (photo included). have also noticed that it keeps burning up oil and there is black residue on the bumper (photo included) which I googled and seen it was from fuel burning. Also on cold start it sounds almost like it wants to bog and the entire car shakes and then idles out. This has just started happening more recently.I think that it may be running too rich and the mechanic didn’t tune the engine when he put it in. I have no way of asking said mechanic bc he moved.

	•	Reliability is very important – I don’t need anything flashy, just dependable

The dilemma:
	•	Should I go down the salary sacrifice route (Tusker), which seems straightforward but might be less value for money?
	•	Or is it better to use the allowance and buy my own vehicle outright?

Car had been looked after by the previous owner with FBMWSH, brand new tyres all around, 11 months MOT with no advisories and the wheels were impeccable. Not a curb mark or white worm in sight.

Parcel cover was broken, salesman swapped it with another one they had in stock if I bought the car there and then. 

Few marks on the bodywork “it’s a used car m8” but then I got money knocked off of my part exchange because of marks. 

Salesmen generally leave you alone when you arrive on site, only when you’re enquiring about something does everything take forever. With the massive open plan hot desks.

Test drive was about 10 minutes long and it was assisted with the salesman,  literally 3 roundabouts and a 50mph straight, probably 5 miles.  

Absolutely no movement on price, no freebies, no tank of fuel, no mats.

They focus on the cost to change, rather than what the cost of the vehicle is. I was paying cash and told them from the get go I wasn’t doing finance, my particular salesman was alright with that but it’s the extras where they get you. 

Got a shit price on my P/X, but they can “increase it” if I take out some of their additional products. I’d been there for 3 hours at that point and I’d already chosen the car on the internet the week before and it still takes forever. 

Not so much as “got stung” but I took out their 1 year extended warranty, diamondbrite or equivalent (which I knew was a farce but I was assured there was a team of 13 Valeters that could apply it in an hour) and their accident repair thing where if you get a dent or scratch they’ll repair it with no excess. 

I was told all of that would be £500, and when I went for some food and came back after I “thought about it” I refused it and it was instantly dropped by £200, got bored of hanging around so I went for it. 

Did the cash transfer, £17k + my PX, nobody came to me within an hour after I’d made the payment even though I knew it had gone through. Then took another hour waiting for handover. Got bored of waiting for that so went for another wander and clocked the salesman and asked if he’d swapped the parcel cover, which he hadn’t. He eventually did do it by the time I’d finalized everything. 

Not a great experience, but I knew what car I wanted with what spec so that took a lot of the bullshit out. I hate any and all car dealerships and salesmen and the process of buying a car but it is what it is. 

I know the warranties aren’t usually worth the paper they’re written on, however my car had a wastegate linkage rattle, a common problem which is literally just a worn spring and washer. 
This was fixed under warranty with absolute no issues or complaints from the warranty company. And parts & labour and diagnosis was easily £450. Could’ve done it myself for £150 but they wanted written reports and VAT registered garages and everything else and I wasn’t paying so I literally didn’t give a fuck. 

All dealerships are wank though, you’ve just gotta grit your teeth and get through it. Everyone’s gotta make their bread.

I got rid of the car as I was tired of repairing it, but I assume once you pass these maintenance issues (oil leaks, shocks) then the car may be fine to run.

It also says at the bottom of the website. Off roads cars only.

“Our DPF Delete service will electronically disable the DPF system along with removing the associated dashboard lights and warning messages permanently via our ECU remapping service.

The removal process; First of all we remove the internal filter only from the exhaust system, unlike other companies we do not fit a simple bypass pipe. Instead, we modify the original DPF unit by cutting a small window in the DPF chamber, we then remove the internal filter, weld the window back into place and refit the DPF unit to the vehicle.

Once the physical filter removal has been completed the ECU (Electronic Control Unit) is reprogrammed (Remapped) and any DPF related structures removed from the vehicles software. This will prevent the vehicle from sensing the missing filter and will prevent future DPF regeneration and warning lights. This is the most important aspect of the removal process and it is vital that the ECU is reprogrammed correctly or DPF issues will continue. When carrying out this process we can also remap the ECU for better performance and fuel efficiency. “",0,1759424782.0,24,CartalkUK,1759519967,2025-10-02 17:06:22,2025-10-03 19:32:47,"landwomble (Score: 10): It's very common, it's not legal, you'll probably get away with it but if you ever need to put it back to stock (like if you sell it, it's pretty unfair on a new buyer) it'll be very expensive.

I've just paid off the bank loan on my Vauxhall Insignia after four years, and it’s been a fantastic car. First car I've ever owned outright and it's been amazing. It's never needed any work outside of its yearly service and has been completely reliable contrary to what people say on this subreddit when insignias come up.

Here's my situation: we’re looking to move house soon, and we already have an MPV diesel as our main family car. So the Insignia is really just a second car. I reckon I could get about £8-10k for it if I sold it today so it feels a bit silly having the money tied up in a car that's just losing value, especially when that money could come in handy for the move.

My thought is to trade in the Insignia for something cheap and fun. I'd love to have a little car for running around in and enjoying myself, and the leftover cash could go straight into the house fund. 

So, I'm wondering if this is a stupid idea? Am I likely to end up spending more on a ""fun"" car than I would just keeping the reliable one I have? And if not, what kind of cheap, fun cars should I be looking at that aren't going to be a money pit? Semi easy to get the baby and dog in the back without ruining my back further?

I am thinking about selling my daily (2009 TTS) and getting another classic to use everyday.

I've only had the TT for a few months and its a great car but it just doesnt excite me like an older car does. I already own a 94 classic mini which is my dream car but its in need of restoration and needs to come off the road for a prolonged period. I would love to pick something up that can still give me my classic fix but is still usable for a 10mile commute everyday while the mini is being sorted. 

I would love to hear your recommendations. Budget sub £10k. Reliability not so much of a worry, I would like to use it daily but if it breaks I have Campervan I could use. I am also fairly handy with a spanner. The mini has my garage space so it would need to live outside and would prefer it doesn't turn to rust. 

A few of my ideas to get the ball rolling.
- MGB (not the most suitable winter daily) 
- E30 3 series (probably not in budget) 
- mk2 Golf GTI
- 944

Requirements,  it will be the ""big"" family car, I know the Korando not exactly big, but when I put a language rack on roof it was fine for holidays and it roomy enough when seating 2 adults 3x kids.. usage wise,  it bit of a weekend vehicle,  as I got a work van all week... mostly used for short journeys, with only the occasional road trip...want it to be functional but also a little fun.

The mid life crisis in me got very excited over a 
3.0 TDI V6 SEL Tiptronic 4Motion Euro 6 (s/s) 5dr on a 2021 plate at 30k... this definitely ticks lots of boxes, but worried about dpf issues if im not taking on frequent long journeys and that it a little too big? Parking not great around my area...also about 10k over what I wanted to spend. 

Next ofc there Volkswagen Tiguan
2.0 TDI R-Line Tech DSG Euro 6 (s/s) 5dr at around 22k... this likely the more sensible goldilocks... but again worried about dpf issues...?

There also a 2.0 T Roc....around 20k on a 2019 plate...but looks even smaller than my ssangyong...and ofc still a deseil...

Finally a 1.5 hybrid tiguan r line, around 25k... which on paper is perhaps the most sensible? But   the engine seems less fun...

1nvxvsx,"£15-20k budget, for a luxury estate, doing about 25k miles a year","Hey Team,

So my 2009 BMW 520d has now done 150k and is starting to show its age (including some battle damage). I love it to bits (it’s like an old faithful family Labrador that won’t die), but my partner says I need to stop being tight, and replace it with something “less shed-like”! … it may be time to finally put it down, as the random idle rattles are starting to increase (the infamous timing chains were done at 100k).

I’m currently doing a 500 mile weekly commute, so it seems silly to buy new; I have a good well-paid job, but sadly a company car isn’t an option. I need something that effortlessly eats up the miles, whilst keeping me comfortable on my 4-5 hour door-to-door drive. It also has to be an estate, as this will be the family “big car”.

I was thinking of dropping £15-20k on one of the following in diesel-auto, with c.60k miles on the clock, on a 2018 plate (in priority): 

- another BMW 520d tourer.
- an E class estate.
- a Volvo V90.

I’d happily consider a car that has previously been written-off (with the right history). Ideally, it would be nice to get four years’ of trouble free motoring out of it.

Does this sound sensible? Am I missing any other options? I have the ability to spend more, but it just seems a bit of waste (I have a classic car for weekend fun).

The second option is the Cupra Formentor also on a 72 plate, slightly more expensive but I’d *hope* with it being VAG it’s slightly more reliable than the DS. I’ve not really heard much good or bad about Cupras to be honest but I see them everywhere.
