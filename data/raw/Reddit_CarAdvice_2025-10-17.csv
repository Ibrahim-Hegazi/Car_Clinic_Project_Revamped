1o8maw3,2014 Ford Taurus sluggish acceleration,There are no issues with combustion as far as I can tell. The idle seems fine and I don’t have any shuttering or spikes in RPMs but I notice when I’m accelerating onto the highway I’m sticking my foot to floor and gradually climbing to like 50mph?

Haven’t heard this noise before, but when I go above 50mph and let off the accelerator, my car makes a shaking sound from the front right. 
Sounds like washboard gravel road or rumble strips maybe.

So whats the issue? could be a head gasket that causes overheating which would be very expensive. could help to flush coolant. Definitely check to see if the coolant is filled properly, on some cars doing the thermostat can get air into the system which is hard to bleed out, and can cause overheating till it does.

1o8gozc,Is the mechanic at fault?,"Hi everyone, this is my first time posting so apologies if this isn’t the right place for this but I’m at a complete loss right now and any help would be much appreciated. 

I had a 2007 Toyota Prius which stopped working a couple of months ago (it was very old and had 250k+ miles on it so I knew this was coming). My boyfriend and I ended up buying my parents’ 2020 Toyota Prius Prime. They had bought it new, has about 70k miles on it, and no prior issues (my dad is very thorough about taking care of his cars). 

About a week after we had the car, it wouldn’t start. Took it to Auto Zone where they replaced the battery and still it wouldn’t start. We took it to a different shop, they told us Auto Zone had put in a dud battery and replaced it again. No biggie, as long as my car works. The next day I realize that the A/C in the car suddenly doesn’t work now, blows hot air but not cool (this was never an issue before). We take it to a completely different shop this time, where they say when replacing the battery there was a power surge and the actuator door that opens and closes to control the temperature got stuck because of it and the motor that controls the door burnt up. They are now quoting us $2500 to fix it, which we absolutely cannot afford. 

My question is fairly simple: what on earth do I do? Is the mechanic who replaced the battery at fault? Is it reasonable to ask them to fix the A/C for free (or at the very least at a huge discounted rate from $2500)? Do we really have any options? Neither my boyfriend nor I know much about cars so we’re at a complete loss as to what to do in this situation.

But they are refusing to even run a diagnostic on it because it’s “modified” even though it is clearly not what caused the issue.

I don’t understand why they can’t examine the cables leading to the splitter of the camera because what’s clearly what’s wrong versus the camera and what’s functionally an extension cord connected to it? It’s kind of impossible to reverted to stock because that would involve removing my shell and cost me lots of time/money that i do not have.

The second shop told me that my bushings on my rear trailing arms needed to be replaced. I completed that work, but the car is still shaking/vibrating when accelerating at high speeds.

Both shops claim to have done a complete review of my suspension system, front and back, and claim everything else looks good.

This is from a 2004 GMC 4.3 V6 with 150,000 miles. I believed there was a gasket issue because I've had coolant pooling between the valve cover and intake manifold.

It's a Fel-Pro PermaDryPlus that was installed 2 years ago by my mechanic. I don't drive this vehicle much - about 3,000 miles each year. The mechanic also swapped the Dex-Cool for some green coolant. The coolant looked fresh, however, that could be because it's been draining itself lately. 😂

Pictured here is a coolant passage portion of the gasket. The gaskets on both banks look like this around the coolant passages.

1o8brby,1994 V8 (5.2L) ZJ Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo just back from the shop. It is transmission-hunting and the Jeep feels it lacks power to the wheels.,"**STORY**: I inherited a V8 automatic transmission ZJ Jeep after the original owner (a relative) died one year ago. The Jeep was cared for meticulously – service schedules adhered to 100% at a single SoCal shop where, he also took his classic Jaguars. The Jeep ran perfectly with 239K miles when I received it. I got no maintenance records – all were thrown out by his widow.

Upon receiving the Jeep I noticed leaky transmission oil on my driveway. As a temporary solution, I added Luccas Transmission Fix. Not sure if it helped, but it didn’t seem to hurt any.

The Jeep's gas gauge was non-functioning. I decided to address both issues and have the Jeep inspected by a reputable local shop.

**WHAT HAPPENED**:  I took my Jeep to the shop for a radiator flush and installation of a new fuel pump assembly. The shop changed my oil to 5W30 Napa synthetic + Napa Gold oil filter, installed new ATO spark plugs and a new spark plug wire set, replaced my leaky transmission oil cooler line, and added 2L transmission fluid. The service receipt said nothing about a transmission flush but I am guessing they did it.

**PROBLEMS**:  Immediately after receiving the Jeep two days ago, I noticed transmission gear hunting on an eight mile climb up a low-grade hill above the shop, and what felt like poor power to the wheels. The gear hunting issue seemed to improve after about seven miles, as did the shifting smoothness – which I attributed to the transmission warming up. The grade of the hill changed slightly on that eight mile climb, which was another variable. No noticeable gear hunting on the descent in Hi-4.

I parked the Jeep 35 hours at my office. Fully cooled, I drove it up a 5.5 mile steady hill to my home last night. The same issue happened: gear hunting and poor subjective power to the wheels.

After cooling the Jeep outdoors overnight I took it out again on pavement this morning on a variety of hills. This time I also drove in Lo-4. The gear hunting was worse in Lo-4 than in Hi-4. About 1/4 mile down a fairly consistent decline the transmission suddenly lurched from third down to second gear. RPMs rose to over 4000. The Jeep was in “D,” not in first or second gear. I was not attempting to engine brake, just steadily driving downhill with my foot lightly on the gas.

I checked my transmission fluid with the engine running and warm, vehicle parked on the level. The tranny dipstick shows oil was below the “add oil” mark.

I understand these old GM transmissions often run better with gunky old tranny oil, and they start having problems after you change the tranny oil. I did not specifically ask to have tranny oil changed, but it was implied because of the leaky transmission oil cooler line. I also did not ask for engine oil change – I always do that myself. (Grumbling because of a $1637 service bill with multiple extra things I did not want done; I gave them a detailed written list of what I needed.)

**QUESTIONS**: 

1. *Aside from driving up the bill, did my shop do any thing wrong?* If they drove the Jeep they would have noticed gear hunting and possibly topped off my tranny oil or fixed the issue before returning it to me. They had my Jeep over three weeks and should have had enough time to make sure it was working properly.
2. Should I take it back to the same shop, top off the tranny oil myself, or add a quart of Luccas Transmission Fix?
3. Any other thoughts?

I am obviously not a mechanic. My daily driver is a manual transmission Mazda 3. Old GM automatic transmissions were a distant memory until I inherited this Jeep.

While I was there, I asked them to replace a headlamp that had just gone out a few days earlier and have a look at the reverse light which hadn’t worked for years.

They charged me $400 for that minor bit of work. Pretty steep but whatever, maybe the gear stick was hard to get to lube.

1o85f6l,"An afternoon in a Dongfeng Nammi Box - Norway's cheapest car, even though it's price doubled on the way over from China","After the Dongfeng Nammi Box [came to Norway last year](https://www.dong-feng.no/box) I have been wanting to drive one. We bought our 2023 Leaf new for 199k NOK, and that's the same price Dongfeng sells its infinitely more modern car for. Currently, that is just below 20k USD and double what these go for in China ([sold as Nano 01](https://csccar.en.made-in-china.com/product/HGhUCdQohikA/China-Compact-Electric-Vehicle-Dongfeng-Nammi-01-for-Urban-Commuting.html)). A cheap car, in short, but reviewers have been enamored with these since they came out, despite sales numbers being surprisingly sluggish, so I was very curious. In the lowest priced car you get a 31.4 kWh battery - mind you, our similarly priced LEAF came with a 39 kWh pack - and for 8% more money, you can get a 42.3 kWh battery. That increases WLTP from 200 to 310 km. Both cars can tow a 750 kg trailer, which isn't much but beats all of those that tow nothing, like the LEAF or e:Ny1.

The super pleasant interior is the absolute strong suite of the Box. There's great visibility, good space and generally a decent material quality over the whole car with many soft touch surfaces. Super squishy seats are fine for comfort and no material leaves ""new car residue"" on your hands like e.g. [Peugeot's steering wheels](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1nw3cei/peugeot_e2008_review_a_few_strengths_in_a_sea_of/). The steeply raked windshield and big windows let in a lot of light. It's a good thing that the steering wheel is not a Chinese style ""squeel"", yet, it is flattened at the top. That's quite pointless, because if it was 100% round, the wheel wouldn't obscure the top part of the screen for me...it can also only be moved up and down, not in and out. Another oddity is that the front doors do not extend far enough back to actually use the door arm rest. That was an issue both for me (1.90m) and my wife (1.75m), but maybe not for shorter people closer to the wheel - a big surprise, though, is that I can sit behind myself. Not possible in much bigger cars like the [Seres 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1iy43n6/same_same_but_different_comparison_of_seres_5/). All four windows are auto (up/down in one go) and they're proper fast, but the switches follow the Chinese tradition of ""up is down and down is up"". There's enough space under the hood for a frunk, but no one told Dongfeng, d'oh. Looks like the car would be a joy to service, though.

With a cute, simple and responsive UI, ambient lights and a glove ""drawer"" instead of a box, there's a lot to like. Unfortunately, the EU mandated beepety bops is 2 clicks to menu, 4 sliders to turn off, which is quite cumbersome. If you leave the car quickly with the key on you, it will turn off and you need to start over (that's a setting, though - it can stay on). The driver attention warning is super eager. Additionally, with the safety show turned off, the car will not inform you of the speed limit anymore, it just shows ""off"" instead. Meh. There are info screens for driving data, tire pressure, service and current consumption. Unfortunately, they disappear after a set time - I'd rather love to have the current consumption screen on at all times. At slow speeds, the Box shows a blinker camera which tops Kia with its big screen. There's also a gimmicky 3D vision.

Convenient features are quite selective. The driver's seat is electric, heated and cooled, all other seats are none of that. That's not very socialist of Dongfeng. There's no rear window wiper or sprayer either. In a country with lots of gravel roads and winter snows, that is a huuuge issue. The Box's rear window tends to fog up, something I also see in traffic, and which the climate control's *auto* setting does nothing about - the driver has to switch on the rear window heater manually. A curiosity is that there, apparently, is no rain sensor either! I kind of like wiping myself, but that's integrated into the blinker stalk, while the gear selector is on the right of the steering wheel...that takes some getting used to. At one occasion, I pressed the button on the right intending to spray the front window, but that's the P-button! The car did not P itself, but I almost did, because it triggered a loud mechanical clunk, a speed reduction, and the error message *too high speed for P*. That should really be blocked by software at speed, especially when the gear selector is in the common wiper position.

The Box is good to drive. It is uninspired, but not unwilling. The biggest issue is that the steering wheel is *heavy*. I'm not sure why they went for that setup - it's a city car, not a city bus, after all. Of course, you'll get used to that, but my LEAF felt like a sports car after switching back. The Nissan is *not* a sports car. Yet, what this interior and driving setup does is calm me down and making me a more relaxed, better driver. I noted after an hour or two that something here had me relax behind the wheel - strange, but cool. Gas and brake response are perfect, but the pedal box is tight for a tall-ish man in size 45 shoes. 17'' ""Wanli Harmonic Plus"" tires work fine, as they are held by four lug nuts and covering some of the tiniest disk brakes on any modern car. 15'' wheels might cover these. The Nammi Box has a 95hp/160Nm engine which, curiously, matches my first car, a [1977 Volvo 242](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMyCar/comments/19al8qa/jumping_on_the_my_first_carbandwagon_1977_242_l/) with the B19A engine at 97hp/158Nm. These cars couldn't be anymore different, but the Box certainly isn't quick which the Volvo, of course, was. Despite also being a box. \#Philosophy. It's sufficient for its intended use, though.

Overall, I came out of this very much positively surprised. Sometimes, you drive a car with certain expectations and they aren't met. The Box exceeded mine, despite it having me way more excited than a cheap car deserves. It's just an exceptionally pleasant car and does what it is supposed to do really well. I can actually see myself buying one, even though my wife's no-Chinese-cars-veto still stands in the home council. She did, though, really like this one, too.

1o7vdzo,Just hate the fact that I didn’t wait longer for manuals,"Sorry this is just a little(maybe not) vent. I barely got to drive manuals in my country (a country in which 90% of the traffic drove manuals) since I was under 18. I always dreamt of driving my dad’s Civic and I learned to drive it when I turned 18. However, shortly after I did my family had to move to the US. Didn’t have a car for 2 years but then I managed to buy a 2007 Camry that was an automatic of course. That’s when I decided, hell or high water, my second car would be a manual. The Camry’s radiator was severely hit by debris on the road and the head gasket blew mid way. I’m a student so it took me a while to be able to finance for my second car. I searched hard and test drove 8 manuals (of course not perfectly but I seriously enjoyed driving em). However I couldn’t use my family car to commute for long (which is also an automatic) so I was under the time pressure to buy something reliable fast. 
I ended up buying a Toyota Corolla 2013 for 10k under 120k miles from a very reputed dealer. The car runs pretty well but I genuinely dislike it. I wasn’t excited about it at all since it’s more of an appliance than a mechanical soul to me. I always wanted to drive sticks effortlessly as a kid and barely got that wish fulfilled. All manuals here were in terrible condition, even when sold by reputed car dealers so I had to resort to something reliable. I absolutely dislike this car and I am so frustrated I didn’t wait for the right manual. Most car rentals don’t rent them no more and Turo charges me hefty amounts just because I’m under 25.

Maybe get a second opinion from another transmission shop to confirm that they think it's the same thing. It's not worth fixing at that price, but if it's still working as transportation for you, just keep driving it until it fails.

Also, another problem on this sheet is the code for the catalytic converter, which could be a $1500 or more repair if it also needs that. You could end up replacing the transmission, only to end up needing a new catalytic converter, and then you'll be in a situation where you've spent more to keep the car running than it's worth. Although, that could mean it's just a bad oxygen sensor and it may not need a catalytic converter, but just something to be aware of.

If the transmission does fail, I recommend scrapping it and looking for a new car. It sounds terrible to have to do that at a car that's relatively new at 2015. However, the mileage is fairly high, and they're not known as being very reliable cars. It's only worth about $5000 as it is now, assuming it didn't have any mechanical problems. If you pay $4800 for a new transmission, you're basically paying the entire value of the car to repair it, and with that many miles, it's very possible you'll have other problems come up in the near future as well."

Tire pressure decreases with temperature, so a tire thats fine in the summer will often be low in the winter due to the cold.

Just like the title says, I’m wondering if I should keep my current 2015 Buick Verano or trade it in for something else. I have recently been having loads of issues with my car. I had farm and fleet completely replace all brake pads and rotors a few months ago for about $600 as they were making a grinding noise. Several weeks later the noise came back, and I took it back in to farm and fleet. They just shrugged it off as my ABS going off when I knew that wasn’t it. I took it to a secondary shop to get it checked out and they informed me to get all the pads and brakes replaced again as there was a shine I believe they said to the brakes. I had also had the auto shop do some routine maintenance on the car costing me $1000. The shop also diagnosed a check engine code that will be another $1000 repair (it was fuel in the air intake, Something about my fuel tank being bolted to the engine block). I took my car back to farm and fleet for the 3rd time and they fully replaced the pads and rotors. Now the noise came back AGAIN even worse now. It’s metal on metal. For context, I drive far for work. It’s about 42 miles one way. I have my car scheduled to get looked at tomorrow by the full service shop that did my maintenance because now I do not trust farm and fleet. Now I’m stuck in this limbo of should I keep spending money to fix my car? Already spent $1600 recently with another pending $1000 repair for check engine and whatever is going on with my grinding brake noise. I only have $1500 left on the car before it is fully paid off. And I was looking forward to paying it off especially because I am planning to go back to school next fall. With how far my commute is however, I need something reliable and will last me.

What I would do is check the coolant in your radiator itself and overflow expansion reservoir. If it’s low try adding fluid in the radiator until it’s topped off and check for leaks at the radiator hoses and expansion reservoir, thermostat. What happens on these D17’s is usually the coolant leaks into the combustion chamber and gets burned up instead of mixing with oil like other cars. If you don’t have any leaks and the radiator is topped off I’d run the car with the radiator cap off for 20 minutes and check if you’re getting air bubbles.

1o8iajy,Car vibrates when changing gears (automatic transmission),"2013 Acura ILX 2.0 5spd auto

For the past month I have noticed that when I accelerate from 1st to 2nd and 2nd to 3rd, there is a vibration that can be felt through the dashboard. It occurs at about 2500-3000rpm and at speeds of 20-25mph(30-40kmh). And it only happens when moving through these specific gears. It happens both when accelerating hard or slow. Idle is smooth, 3rd to 4th and 5th gears respectively work fine.

My first thought was the issue with roads. I have tested acceleration on both good and bad roads and it still occurs despite going on a smooth surface.

Second thought was bad wheel balance, so I went to the shop to check the balance. However they have said that even if the wheels were unbalanced, they wouldn’t generate vibrations at such low speeds. They did tell me however that my rear tyres seem to have been stored incorrectly, and seem to have some issues that could potentially produce such vibrations. (Michelin Primacy 5, all bought from the same place, same production week 47-24). They have advised me to wait for temps to drop, switch to winter tyres and see if the vibration persists.

I am also considering engine mounts, CV axle or transmission fluid. Important to mention that the car is due for an ATF change as the fluid already has 4 years and about 25k miles.

1o7u8lo,2013 CRV - Axle advice - OEM or aftermarket,"Mileage -120,000 miles

My CRV has been shaking pretty good when getting up to speed between 60-72mph (after about 72 the shaking dampens quite a bit or stops completely).

At first I thought the tires needed to be rotated. So I took them in to Big Brand Tires and they rotated and then went for a test drive with one of the workers. They put the CRV up and looked underneath and said the front axles are shaking pretty good and probably should be replaced. They recommended to ONLY go with OEM Honda axles, but the price tag is around $600 per axle according to them - so $1200 for parts.

I am seeing online I can get aftermarket axels for around $150 each - So $300 for parts - For a difference of almost $900 total. SEEMS CRAZY. Are the aftermarket ones truly that bad? Or is there a good brand of aftermarket that is comparable to Honda OEM.

Any advice would be appreciated.",1,1760580725.0,8,autorepair,1760729627,2025-10-16 02:12:05,2025-10-17 19:33:47,"Bruce65lv (Score: 1): Never had a problem with aftermarket axles.

Also, a CRV with 120k probably has more front end issues than needing an axle replacement. Your control arm bushings, sway bar links, tie rods, struts etc may all be approaching EOL at that age and mileage so I wouldn't be surprised if more needed to be replaced. 

Last thing is, make sure the tires and wheels are all balanced, imbalanced wheel will exaggerate any front end issue.

It came with the manual and it said 06, but then why does the vin come up as 05?

Insurance adjuster met the shop and inspected car noted obvious electrical damage fuses “black” etc (important later) 

So a week or two after getting to them they finally got rolling on repairs and immediately called to tell me there were mechanical issues and the car is stalling. We sent it there with ZERO mechanical issues and I told them this repeatedly, but they insisted we’d have to keep chasing these mechanical repairs because they couldn’t even assess the electronic system until the mechanical issues were solved. They kept calling me saying “well this is odd we tried to fix XYZ that didn’t work so now we have to do ABC to try and isolate variables”

OK IF YOU’RE STILL HERE - so all this mechanical work that I insisted made no sense was finally solved when someone checked the fuse panel and realized there was a fuse missing that was the root cause of the stalls. They got the car running fine that day with fuse replacements, and did a thorough check of Electricals and it seems like the fuses did their job. The shop was flabbergasted and called me to tell me they had no idea how the fuses got pulled, I reminded them of their initial contact telling me both they and the adjuster were in the fuse panel. 

So that was two weeks ago, and the car has been sitting there fixed and they’re pretty much just not telling me anything while the car just sits there and we’re going on 7 weeks now as a one-car house and have already had to rent for at least one situation and have another coming up.

Why aren’t they telling me anything? Am I on the hook for the unnecessary repairs that were done because someone forgot to put a fuse back in? How would you approach this with a customer?

1o8j9kh,Had out of province inspection,"I am confused.  If someone can help explain.

Took my car to a dealership for an inspection.  It came back that I needed to have a wheel alignment.  No problem.  I asked to have a quote on all season tires as well.

When I left the dealership when my car was done the exclamation point was on and all tires were at a different level.  I went back in to ask them why it was showing this.  The guy put air in all tires and said it could be the TPMS but said it should be fine.
I left and the exclamation mark was off and all tires were still coming back at different levels.  212,220,230,216.  I called them today after I took a drive and seen the air pressure on the tires was still off.  I was told it wasn’t a big deal and to come in and they will put air pressure in the tires or I could do it at a gas station myself.
I asked about the all season tires quote she said she would text me.  She never did.
So I am concerned I feel like I was pushed out the door.  I don’t know if the inspection is right.  My car is under bumper to bumper warranty so I am concerned it might be something they just don’t want to deal with.  I feel unsafe in my car now.

1o8j46s,2010 Elantra Blue Rev Hang,"Hey guys! Recently I got my first manual car, a 2010 Elantra Blue with 86k miles, clean Carfax etc. Overall it's been great, but I'm getting a little frustrated with the rev hang in this thing, it prevents me from accelerating as fast as traffic in 1-4. I've gotten in the habit of letting off the gas for a moment before pressing the clutch just for smoother shifts, but that doesn't seem to help, nor does shifting at various RPMs like I've seen recommended. In fact the revs will sometimes increase 200-300rpm when I press the clutch and I'm off the gas (especially from 4-5). 

It has a mechanical throttle body which I've cleaned. I've cleaned the PCV valve, MAF, bought a new air filter, and checked for vacuum leaks, none of which helped the rev hang. I also have a hard time giving the car just a few hundred revs above idle, any throttle input typically brings it up at least 700-800rpms no matter how gentle I am. Not sure if that could be related.

I've read online that it can be an emissions/ecu thing, but most of the cars that seem to have that problem are drive by wire, my throttle is mechanical. I'm running out of ideas, let me know if y'all have any thoughts.

I have a 2006 BMW 116i (E87, 1.6L N45 engine) and I’m trying to figure out a couple of issues that recently started happening. I’ve attached two short videos so you can hear what’s going on.

1️⃣ “Grrr” noise at cold start:
When I start the car and move off in 1st gear, the car shakes as if I’m doing a bad clutch point (even when I’m not). I also hear a “grrr” noise coming from the front of the engine for a few seconds. After driving for a few minutes, the noise and the shaking go away completely.

It sounds like a bearing or pulley issue — could this be the belt tensioner, idler pulley, or serpentine belt starting to fail?

2️⃣ Air leaking sound (“pshhh”):
When I rev the engine, I can clearly hear air escaping from somewhere before the throttle body. It sounds like a vacuum or intake leak — maybe a cracked intake hose, loose clamp, or PCV hose?

Has anyone experienced both of these symptoms together?
I’m planning to replace the serpentine belt, tensioner, and idler pulley, and also check the intake hose and PCV lines for cracks — but I’d love to hear from others who’ve had the same issue before I start ordering parts.

USA, gasoline model  
200k miles

Original AT

The hole where the AT drain plug goes into is stripped.

I believe it does **not** have a transmission pan, a place where the drain hole is located on certain vehicles, like a baking pan it lays flat, horizontal. It appears the drain hole is on the side of a transmission cover.

I think I might replace it, because the drain hole thread is damaged(not the drain **plug**, but the actual part of the transmission where the plug goes into). If this is a relatively simple task that does not require removing the whole transmission, I will do it. But if I have to remove the transmission or parts of the subframe, I will see about re threading the hole.

Any general advise on fixing stripped threads on a transmission drain hole? I hope I am using the right words, ""transmission drain hole"".

EDIT: changed the word ""bolt"" to ""plug""

I’ve been having trouble with my 2017 Chevy Cruze 1.4L ever since I bought it in 2019. The turbo crapped out on me early on, and even though I put in a brand new one and a new catalytic converter, it still burns oil off like crazy. I change the oil pretty often and top it off because of this. It is not constantly throwing out a warning of “Oil pressure low” even though it doesn’t have a leak and I know the oil is new and full. It seems to do it worse when I am going uphill or when I am low on gas, though I don’t know if those things have anything to do with it. 

At one point I was told that my oil had metal shavings in it, but this was before I knew that it was burning oil so I have been very diligent in changing it every 3000 miles and with checking it once a week and topping it off when needed. I also have to change the O2 sensor relatively often (like 2x over the last year) as it gets dirty really fast.

Slow coolant loss with no puddles, no smoke and no milky oil narrows it down. Short version: either a small external leak that’s evaporating, or a slow internal loss (head gasket / intake / heater core) that isn’t obvious yet. Here’s what to check and do, in order:

Likely causes  
\- Small external leak that evaporates at highway speeds (hose clamp, radiator seam, condenser, overflow fitting).  
\- Slow internal leak into combustion chamber (head gasket, cracked head/block). Can burn off without obvious white smoke on long steady drives.  
\- Heater core leak into the cabin (would cause damp carpet or sweet smell).  
\- Leak through an inline cooler (transmission/AC) or a tiny pinhole in a hose.  
\- Faulty reservoir cap or wrong pressure cap (even if new, verify correct spec).

Basic checks you can do now  
\- Park on clean concrete/driveway and look for any residue or spots after a run.  
\- Smell cabin and under-hood for sweet coolant odor.  
\- Check carpet and footwells for dampness.  
\- Remove oil dipstick and look for contamination again.  
\- Note how much coolant you add (ml/qt) and how many miles it lasts.

What the shop should do (priority)

1. Pressure-test the cooling system (hold pressure with the cap removed). This will reveal external leaks and weak caps.
2. Combustion-leak test (block test/CO2 tester) to rule in/out head gasket or combustion gases in the coolant.
3. UV dye in coolant + run and inspect for traces under the car and around fittings.
4. Inspect heater hoses, clamps, radiator seams, A/C condenser and underbody after a run.
5. If tests are inconclusive, consider a cooling-system flush and repeat tests while running.

Given your mileage (140–150 mi/day), a small loss will show fast. Track consumption: if you’re losing more than \~0.5–1 liter per 1000 miles it’s worth immediate pressure + block testing.

If you want, tell me:  
\- How many liters/ounces you topped up two weeks ago and how much is missing now, and  
\- Whether you notice any cabin fogging, sweet smells, or check-engine lights.

I’ll tell you which test result points to what.

Here's the dilemma: I want something used, in the 30k range. He wants something brand new and in the 45k-50k range. I want our payments to be 300-375/month. He isn't thinking about having to replace his truck with 230k miles on it in the near future. I am, hence striving to find a vehicle now that will be less per month. 

I found a 2020 Chevy Tahoe LS with 64k miles on it for 30k. I dont know much about Chevy's as far as reliability, longevity, and how costly the repairs are.

My husband wants a 2026 Kia Carnival (top trim level) for 50k. I just cannot wrap my brain around trading in my Honda for a KIA... They've tried to up their game from what I understand, but they still feel so cheap inside (we looked at one yesterday).

I took my car to a mechanic and I was given an estimate of around $7,000 to $8,000 to fix it.  I was told that while it would be better to get it fixed, I could just keep track of the oil and add more as needed.

Yesterday I decided to take my car in for another oil change.  This time, I took it to the mechanic that gave me the estimate.  Actually, this business has a mechanic that works there, but the first time I went, there was another guy there.  He was out yesterday due to health issues, so the guy that did the oil change let me know that there is a leak from the Air/Oil Separator Plate.

The new estimate I was given is for $953.97, but if I get it done this month, I could get an additional 10% off of that.

The estimate shows the following:

Labor:  Research Air/Oil Separator Plate
Parts:  Permatex Gasket Sealant
            Fel-Pro Engine Intake Manifold Gasket Set.

As I mentioned above, the estimate for the above work is $953.97.  Much better than the $7,000 - $8,000 it was going to cost based on the first estimate (from the same place.)

Does the $953.97 seem like a reasonable amount for the work that needs to be done?

Also, I'm not mechanically inclined, but if I know someone who is, would this be a relatively simple fix, without having to go to a shop?

1o7xluf,"2019 Ford Escape, 1.5L ecoboost","Hello community, first time posting here.

I have an escape currently at the dealership, after hearing a knock. Couple days later, they inform me that the bottom skirt of a piston has broke off and damaged the engine block. I will attach the photos the dealership sent me. 

The engine only has around 94,000 miles on it, if that information helps.

Due to this, they said the engine has to be replaced. I was quoted essentially 12 thousand USD for full engine replacement. That is something I cannot afford, but there is someone at my job that is a very skilled mechanic guy who, supposedly, has done engine swaps before. Currently, I'm waiting on more information from them. Before I make any decisions, I thought I would ask a few questions here.

Would it be worth it to have someone re-sleeve the cylinders and new pistons? It might be enough to save the block, it's a car that is paid off. 

I can't really ask if an engine swap is ideal as I'm still waiting on more information, but up to how much would be an okay amount before I give up on it?

If it isn't, should I just drive it until it gives out completely then get a new vehicle?

I apologize for the slight rambling, I'm just heartbroken since it's the first vehicle I ever fully paid off. I had expected it to last longer than it has.

1o7wv3f,Tranny main seal keeps going,"Hi. I have a 2013 Ford Escape, 220,000kms
Backstory; last year a mechanic saw ""tiny metal peices"" in transmission fluid and said my transmission would probably go, so after said mechanic test drove it and said it was otherwise in good shape, I had a brand new Transmission built and put in at a cost of $6000. 
3 months later main seal leaking and had to be replaced (under warranty).
Now, 6 months later main seal has gone again. The transmission shop is again replacing it under warranty ( thank goodness). The Transmission guy said there must be a pressure in the engine that keeps blowing the main seal, but no more ideas because he is ""not an engine guy"".
Does anybody have any suggestions as to what could be going on please?
As a single disabled Mom and Grandma, my car is very important to me. 
Sidenote: last month I took the car in for an oil change to random mechanic. When he was done I noticed drips of oil underneath my car in the parking lot. Guy said it was no big deal he was ""just messy"". Got home and Car dripping oil all over my parking spot. When I took it back to him he put it up on the hoist and showed me that it was coming from the main seal, which is how I found out that it needed replacing again.
I don't like to think this but is there anything that oil guy could've done during the oil change to damage the main seal? Or was it  a coincidence that it started leaking when he finished the oil change?
Any advice or suggestions will be really appreciated.
Thank-you

Long story short, the driver's side door wiring harness is missing the wire leading to the courtesy light (the entire E2 wire). Looking closely at the wiring, it doesn't look like the E2 wire was ever there to begin with; i.e., there is no cut wire or any sort of bandage visible. I'm wondering if I can add a wire or if it would be safer to buy an OEM Limited trim harness and wait on that?

I’m pretty new to cars, I’m only involved because my husband is into them. Today I had a big scare with this car and I’m looking for some possible insight or thoughts on diagnosing it?

For some background, about 2-3 months ago, my husband and I bought this car from a used car dealer. The 2016 Golf R is automatic and had 133k miles on it (I know, I heard that’s bad for a euro car, but we bought it anyways). The exterior isn’t completely stock as the previous owner tweaked a few things to make it appear slightly sportier. We also have a guess that the previous owner messed with things mechanically by tuning it. None of that is for sure though.

Today I was heading to the butcher and as I almost got there a beeping alert went off and showed up on the dash. It read “12.6v battery not charging. Stop vehicle!” So I pulled over and stopped. My husband, on the phone, thought that meant the alternator was starting to go bad and that I would be fine to continue to the store to get what we needed and then go to an oreilys to confirm if it was the alternator going bad. The oreilys man confirmed that the alternator was cooked and we would need to replace it. I asked him if I would be fine making the 25 minute drive home and he said absolutely since the battery still has some juice. I forgot to mention, the battery tested good/healthy but needed charge as it was at 56% confirming the bad alternator suspicion. Once the car started again to go home, the alert from before popped up again.

I got on the interstate heading home and about 10 minutes into the drive the rpm meter stick waved over to the right hitting the red line (8000rpm) and then stayed there until I pulled over. I also noticed off to the right where it tells me what gear I’m in was jumping from D6 to D4 and then D5 and more. Basically it was just jumping all over the place. Once I slowed the car down in the shoulder my steering wheel completely locked up. I hadn’t fully parked the car yet when this happened. Once I parked it started throwing all sorts of alerts at me. Tire pressure errors, airbag errors, every light that could be lit up slowly started lighting up. I got multiple back to back errors saying “Error. Electrical system. Stop!”,  brake malfunction, steering system malfunction and more. My parking brake was put on for me and so was auto hold (not sure what that is). Anytime I touched the wheel to try and move it to the left or right it would yell at me again with the beeping and tell me to stop the car. My traction control turned off and I think that’s it that I can remember. The dashboard started getting dimmer and flickering but the car never completely died as the lights would still turn on once the door opened. I eventually quickly just turned the whole car off on the side of the interstate.

I know it’s probably the alternator but can it cause all of that stuff to happen? Or it is just because Volkswagens have a ton of sensors and if one thing goes it all goes kinda thing. Idk, but this was easily added to the top 10 scariest nights of my life.",1,1760574997.0,2,AskMechanics,1760729627,2025-10-16 00:36:37,2025-10-17 19:33:47,"MaybeVladimirPutinJr (Score: 1): Old cars didn't have many electronic systems so when you lost electrical power the car would just die.

Car won’t start, battery has been recently replaced. Video attached shows two start attempts, one before battery replacement, one after.

Longer Background:
My 2005 Audi Quattro A4 Allroad 2.7L V6 twin turbo died in my driveway. Originally I assumed it was an electrical issue, it had died a couple times in the week before and could be brought back with a jump start(from a battery starter, jumper cables from another car wasn’t powerful enough). I check the battery with a multimeter and read 3.4V, tried trickle charging it but did little to raise voltage. Ended up replacing battery with a brand new one. I thought that would be the end of my troubles but tried starting again and no luck. The problem seems different now though as the car attempts to start (see video, first attempt is before battery replacement and second is after) and the battery holds its charge. The only engine code showing is PO171 which seems to be an unrelated issue but I’m no mechanic. 

I can’t afford to tow it or pay for a mechanic so any help anyone can offer would be hugely appreciated. Taking any advice on either fixes or more tests to diagnosis exact issue. Thanks!

 A specialist in younger drivers over 25 and adding drivers usually lowers premiums you would think but probably not other family.  Have a chat with your sister to see if you will be flexible before you ring round.  If you add your partner tho that should actually lower your premiums. Not sure how to advise on your sister being on your policy if it is bumping it up.  If you want try different combinations on insurance use a local broker like Howden ( don't advise to try these options yourself otherwise this may trigger a flag that actually raises your premiums.)  Steer clear of the likes of Admiral and Hastings. If you don't fit their criteria they don't want you. Shop around but maybe use brokers rather than these websites or direct to the insurance company. Brokers will compete to get you a better deal.  Try not to get to many quotes See where this gets you tomorrow. Friday. is not however the best day to ring round.

However stylistically and logically mazda 3 from that gen is better. It is NA so no turbo, less to fail. Engines are solid 90k miles is nothing. It's not gonna have 1.4 tsi performance (unless you get post face lift mazda 3 with skyactiv x and 180 bhp), but it will be more smooth and better for short trips. Turbo engines needs good warm up and cool down after each run and oil chamge intervals at around 5k. I used to own mazda 6 from 2017. Maintenance was super cheap, reliable no issues whatsoever. Same engine as 3, but 3 is slightly detuned (I believe 120-140 hp vs 165 had in my 6). Also fuel efficency is great. Not sure where you are based but my 6 was doing 38 imperial mpg mixed with 70% city driving. This is around 32 US mpg in bigger heavier car, so expect more from 3. Also, worth adding fuel cleaner additive from time to time or use premmium fuel to limit carbon buildup as its gdi engine. However with this mpg, I think its worth spending.

Insurance wise, mazda probably will be cheaper to insure despite bigger engine size as leons are considered boy racer cars.

Look for cars with good service history, at least yearly oil intrvals if milleage per year was average. Check for receipts of timing belt replacement on leon, mazda chain is said to be lifetime, but inspection would be wise, for any slack, knock etc. Maybe possible that you will find one that had it changed. Check for breaks and tires wear. 

In Mot reports check for advisorys that appear same over long period of time, this means that person did not care much about their car and driven it until changes were a must. Rust on these gens should not be a problem."

The 540i has been a truly wonderful car, the engine is sublime. I bought it 16 months ago with only 26k miles on the clock, one owner directly from BMW. I always said I would keep for 2 years before I would probably end up in an EV but had to have a ‘proper’ car at least on. 
However, it’s our only family car and we only do about 4k miles a year (mainly wfh and commute via bicycle) and it pains me starting up that glorious engine up and driving 2 miles to drop my daughter off at nursery. It’s ‘too good’ for us really.  I am fortunate to own outright so will get £7k back which will be handy for house stuff (wife booking holidays) and hopefully I will have a car which can do 90% of what I get out of the BMW. I rarely go out without the kids so the 340bhp is kind of overkill, although I will miss the smoothness of that B58.

For BMW the most likely issues you'll need to worry about are the oil and coolant leaks. Leaks from the rocker cover and oil filter housing gaskets are basically ubiquitous across most engines. It's about 4-6hrs labour + parts to sort those. Of course that then depends on labour rates in your area.

Best course of action is find out what specific engine you want, e.g. in the 430d it will be an N57, 435i will be an N55, then go to that specific Subreddits and learn about the common issues and when they happen. Then you can cross reference with the history of a specific car you're looking at and managed expectations

1o89k90,True cost of a car UK,"Hi all, 

Having moved to the UK from the US and gotten my driver license. (London) I am now looking to get a car of some sort. Passed my test a few months back. (Mid 30s Male)

Before we go any further this isn’t just a which car should I buy, but also a “what is the true cost of owning a vehicle in London/UK” 

The way I am looking at it is as follows. 

Lease: Leases aren’t really preffered because you don’t own anything and basically pay away the deterioration… initial payments ranging from 2k+ and then paying 300 quid monthly for something you don’t own… I just can’t fathom that. Insurance is another 200 minimum.. all I. Monthly with everything that’s another 6k a year. So year 1 is basically the cost of a pretty decent used car.  All in I assume min 500 a month? 

Beater: Can buy a car for under 5K and get something to have and not really worry about. Albeit insurance is high you can put a down payment of 1/2 of the car and finance the rest through a low interest loan to build credit. ( I have no loans or credit cards…. Debit only… all jokes aside if you can’t tell by this post I’m a pretty money conscious person) By owning the car I can also do with it as I please, not be limited to miles, but do take the risk of having a crappy little car that ends up in the shop all the time…. My whole reason for a car is to take the other half for road trips outside of London and play some golf.

So many cars on the road are lease, fleet, PCP or another finance, none of which means you own your car. It seems the preferred way to temporarily pretend you own something you simply can't afford.

AdMurky8167 (Score: 37): Some factors to consider:

1. Annual MOT (about £40-50)
2. Annual servicing (About £200-400 for a standard car)
3. Vehicle repairs (clutch, belts, brakes etc)
4. Tyres (and tyre replacement due to punctures etc)
5. Resident parking permits (for on street parking). In some cases, newer apartment blocks have legal clauses where residents are banned from applying for parking permits so you'd have to pay for a private parking space if you do not have one included with your home.
6. Traffic violation enforcement: £80 if paid within 14 days, £160 if paid within 28 days. Cameras enforce bus lanes, yellow box junctions, prohibited turns, school streets and car free streets/filters. You could quite easily rack up thousands of pounds in fines in a day in London if you're not careful.
7. Insurance. Can be pricey. Depends on your risk profile and location and car.
8. Pay and display parking fees when you take your car away from home. Most of London charges for parking. Some councils charge based upon how 'dirty' your car is and what fuel type it uses.
9. ULEZ and congestion charge. £12.50 a day charge for older/polluting cars for most of London. £15 a day fee to drive into central London for most cars.
10. Tolls to use the Blackwall tunnel, Silvertown tunnel etc.
11. Budget for some vandalism (i.e. smashed windows) and do not leave anything in your car which might tempt someone to break in.
12. Fuel
13. Road Tax (vehicle excise duty)- an annual charge to keep your car on the road.
14. Depreciation of the car - once you buy it (if you're buying), you're unlikely to sell it for a similar price.
15. Breakdown service. Someone to tow you/get you back on the road when things go wrong.

1o83384,Check engine light help,"Hi all,

Vauxhall corsa 2020. Check engine light came on yesterday. OBD scanner is showing this.

Something to do with the exhaust sensor after a bit of googling but I’m a rookie and unfortunately can’t do much maintenance. I can take a look around the exhaust for the sensor but I wouldn’t know much more.

Was planning on driving about 200 miles on Saturday so really just wanted to know if it’s a code I could clear and get it looked at another week?

I just recently had a mot and full service + some other bits done like new battery, spark plugs, fuel additive.

They can and do get covered in soot from unburnt fuel through normal use. They can get thrown up after a service.


I would clear it now, and see if it comes back. Give the car an Italian tune up (have some fun!) and if it comes back look at checking the wiring first for breaks, and the after that, replacing them. Keep an eye on how your car is running in the mean time - normal power, normal economy etc.

1o82w6z,Grinding/squeaking noise when steering?,"Hi, my Peugeot 107 has had a weird issue for around a month where when I am steering, particularly at higher turning rates and especially at full lock where it is apparently so loud that while I am parking, I do get funny looks. 

I've felt the occasional vibration through the wheel at full lock but other than that, the actual car has been driving fine for just over a month with this issue. 

I should add, in the time since this started I have somehow passed a MOT test with no advisory items, so whatever this is, isn't something the MOT looks for. The garage who did my pre-mot service couldn't find anything but that was just doing the service. It originally failed for a bush being worn out as the only thing of note, that same garage fixed it and next MOT was flying colours. 

I am privately selling the car very soon, is this issue worth taking to the garage to get fixed? The car is clean and has a newish clutch and exhaust and drives well aside from this, so I feel there's still some life left, but this steering thing would put any buyer off having this as anything but scrap. That said though, I wouldn't want to stick a few hundred pounds fixing a car when I'm not gonna see much money for it anyway.

1o7zwlb,Seat Leon Cupra 300 - To Sell or To Keep,"Hi Car Talk, I've been wrestling with a decision for a few months on changing my car, 2017 Cupra 300 with 50k on the clock. It's been fine, no major issues and paid off in full. It does need rear wheel alignment doing, and the bolts have rusted so a garage have quoted a max price of £1,300 worst case. I think if I want to swap it now is the time before that work needs doing. I think it's still worth about £15k to sell. 

I love the car - if I change it, I don't want to spend more money so options are:  
Option 1 - Just shut up and keep it, I won't go faster for less in anything more reliable.  
Option 2 - Buy a cheaper car for £5k and bank £10k.  
Option 3 - Straight swap it for something else. 

If I swap it, it doesn't need to be as fast but I do want something a bit different, but also reliable, and practical.... maybe just asking too much! I do like old Volvo's, I like estate cars, I like the Suzuki Vitara (don't as me why).

When I test drove it, the charge was at 36% showing around 72 miles range. The dealer offers a 3-month warranty on the car and says the battery is covered by Skoda for 8 years or 100,000 miles - as per Skodas warranty.

I’m quite new to buying cars at this price point & paying in full £17K ish so I’m a bit nervous. A few questions:

Is 91% battery health normal for this age/mileage?

Anything specific I should check or be cautious about with this model?

If I pay in full and later discover battery or charging issues, do my consumer rights allow me to reject & return car to the dealer or request a refund/repair by them? As they say any battery issues go to Skoda. 

Would it be safer to pay by credit card (even partly) to get extra protection under Section 75?

You have till 2030 for the warranty which is 70% capacity. They wouldn't offer it if there was a high likelihood of it happening it will probably still be at 80+ by 2030. Unless there is some freak manufacturing defect or you absolutely hammer the crap out of it on a DC fast charger daily.

Azzuro_1 (Score: 3): First off, you are on the cartalkuk sub of reddit. Prepare to see some comments steering you away from EVs with no real tangible reasons because of the herd mentality.

91% SOH after 3.5 years seems a bit on the low side. I don’t know much specifically about the Enyaq or how good Skodas BMS is, but degradation should be about 1%-2% per year. The battery warranty is good, so you are covered for defects, it’s extremely unlikely that it would be needed to be used because of a capacity reason, or even a defect, as someone else mentioned the threshold will be something like 70% SOH.

There is a bit of a fixation on the battery side of EVs, I’m guessing its because its one of the most expensive parts, but ironically, it’s the single item that is the least likely to give you a problem. The most common issues around EVs are software, charging, electronic modules etc.

No reason to be nervous, it carries no more risk than if you would buy an ICE Enyaq. Would you worry about the gearbox grenading itself or needing a new engine if it were a petrol engine?
