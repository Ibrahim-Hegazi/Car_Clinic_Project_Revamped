1nqmgb7,Mercedes steering issue on highway,"Okay this is going to be super specific but here goes. My wife recently bought a 2022 Mercedes GLC with $18K miles. Seems to drive fine except for this one issue on the highway. We haven’t noticed it any other times. 

For context most of the section of highway we drive regularly had some work done right between the two lanes which left a slight hump in the pavement when it was repaired. Anytime we switch lanes and go over this uneven section the car noticeably pulls in the same direction we are traveling (i.e. pulls to the left when switch from right lane to left lane). The faster you go the more noticeable it is. 

Normally I would blame the road for this, but I can’t replicate the issue with my car. I checked her tir pressure and it’s normal. Could this be a steering column issue? Or just a weird quirk?

Probably neither of these.  Fuel filters don't give off smoke, if something goes wrong with the cat you usually get a check engine light long before other symptoms.  And cats generally don't give off smoke when they go bad.

What did the engine temperature gauge show?  Did the check engine light come on?  Have you checked fluid levels (oil, coolant etc)?

1nqhhyp,"Lumpy Idle, Misfire and EML - very low STFT?","Curious one that's been bugging me a while and running out of ideas!

2006 Renault Clio 3 - 1.4 16v petrol. Lumpy at idle and periodically flashing the engine management light, mostly when its be sat at idle a while rather than being driven.

Had a garage change the plugs and do a scan, they suggested problem is an injector (previous fault read said cylinder 2/3 misfires) so I've fitted a whole new set of injectors. That initially caused a bit of hesitant running that cleared up after some driving, with the eml not coming back initially, but after 24hrs or so the hesitation retuned along with the eml and lumpy idle (not sure the idle ever really got much better). Code read said the usual P0300 random multiple cylinder misfire, as well as a P0130 o2 sensor malfunction, but no longer any specific cylinder misfire.

Did a scan and recording of a few fuelling bits after this, looking to see if anything looks obviously off - seems like the first o2 sensor is doing what I've read it should at idle with the cycling up and down, but not sure about the near constant 0.9v at 2.5k revs, and more concerningly the STFT1 is super low, hanging around -100% most of the time, apart from when I come off throttle?

Current thinking is between either the first o2 sensor or the MAP sensor being faulty, but would very much appreciate any thoughts or what else I could check!

Just to add a little more - this morning I tried unclipping the MAP sensor to see what effect it would have - it seemingly brought the STFT1 into a much more reasonable band, although it does make the throttle very sensitive so its very difficult to drive like this, but maybe proves the point the MAP sensor is bad?"

are you using ChatGPT or something? that's all wrong

That's not what those codes mean. Voltage in this context can be interpreted to mean function. Also, the voltage of the vehicle when running is controlled by the alternator. 

The shifting is probably a blown transmission. You can replace the fluid, sure, but its not going to do anything helpful.

If this problem only started after your repair, it’s worth getting it looked at. Sometimes the jets are adjusted or replaced incorrectly, or the pump outlet might have been reinstalled slightly off-angle. I’d suggest taking it back to the shop, (politely) pointing out the new spray pattern, and asking them to verify alignment—it’s often a simple adjustment rather than a full replacement.   
  
Not sure about the Golf specifically but the rear jets usually have small, directional tips that can be gently rotated or nudged with a pin or needle to change the spray angle.

1nqf0og,2008 Corolla overheating only in traffic after highway driving,"Hey everyone,

I have a 2008 Toyota Corolla and recently ran into an overheating issue. A couple of weeks ago, I was getting off the highway after cruising at around 80 mph, hit traffic, and noticed my temp gauge climbing. It was the first time it happened. I was only a few lights away from home, so I turned the A/C on full blast to see if it would help, but the car only cooled down once traffic started moving again.

I took it to a shop afterward, but they couldn’t find anything wrong. They scanned it, no codes came up, so I just did an oil change and got the car back.

After monitoring it for a few days, the same thing happened again: driving fast on the highway, then hitting stop-and-go traffic, and the temp starts creeping up. Once I’m moving again, it cools back down. It only seems to happen in the afternoons during traffic. On my morning commute, no overheating at all. I also tested by taking back roads (around 35–45 mph with some light stop-and-go), and it never overheated.

I’m planning to take it back to the shop soon, but I wanted to ask here first:
	•	Why would it only overheat after highway driving when stuck in traffic?
	•	Could this be a cooling fan issue, thermostat, or something else?
	•	Anything I should specifically ask the mechanic to check?

It tells you there is a misfire in cylinder 2.  That might be the coil, it might be the spark plug, it might be the fuel injector or it could be something else.  The cool thing about troubleshooting it is that you can swap parts from one cylinder to another, and see if the code changes, indicating the problem has moved.

Don't let a parts store sell you a whole set of coils.  If your car needed a new coil in every cylinder, you wouldn't have been able to drive it there.  Ignition coils aren't a wear item.  They do go bad, but should be replaced only when they fail or show signs of failing.  It's okay to change just one coil and leave the others in service.

Owning a basic code reader will help if you're doing the work yourself.  You can find a stand alone unit for under $20, and even less for the kind you use with a smart phone.

If it was my own car, and knowing I had a code P0302, I would start by swapping coils between cylinders 1 and 2, test driving the car, then checking to see if the P0302 had turned into a P0301.  P0301 tells me it's a problem with the coil, and if it stays P0302 it's something else.  Then you can repeat the process with the spark plugs, and then the fuel injectors, without buying any new parts until you know you need them  If you still can't isolate the problem after swapping those 3 components around, it's time to do some advanced testing on cylinder 2.

About two weeks after that I had some intermittent starting issues (this happened maybe 3 times), where the engine would turn over for a few seconds and fail. I then would try it again and it would work. 

My wife drove the car and when stopped at a stop sign, according to her, ""The engine cut off."" 

I took it to a local mechanic (a AAA branch), who said they had no recorded code issues. They drove it, idled it, tried cranking it dozens of times without issue. I had them do a fuel service while it was there as well.

1nqbsay,2014 Jeep Compass 2.0L 6 speed Auto 6F24 Trans,"I did the Chrysler Special Dipstick way of draining and filling my fluid. It had 255,000 miles on it so I figured since it shifted fine and sounded fine I should maintenance it.
I came across many different technics to change this fluid on the “sealed trans”
Even went to many dealers and all said they don’t touch it and the ones that did suggested to flush it (puke) 
There was a Chrysler Bulletin that stated to drain fluid , add so many ounces like right over 100 
Open this plastic plug and let it run out for 3 mins.
You then measure and if 34 fl oz come out you close it up and add 24 more fluids.
If 34 doesn’t come out in 3 mins you go back and redo steps to get back to 34 coming out.

I wanted to see if anyone heard of this work around method that Chrysler started to use.
Or is the dip stick method good.

The reason: it seems I have the correct dipstick , ordered for the 6F24 trans. And I checked it at 148 degrees with a gun shot right down the check fill port so I know my fluid level is correct but I feel like I added more than they would have when they do the other method.
Reason is how low this is. I opened it briefly and trans fluid shot out I thought it would drain it all out so I closed it up.

So basically which is the true tried and way to check this trans fluid once and for all.
Chrysler Bulletin
Or Chrysler special dipstick

There are three ways to diag a draw: 1) DC amp clamp, 2) Voltage drop, 3) Inline ammeter. DC (milli)amp clamps are good, but they cost $60+. Voltage drop measurements can be done by any multimeter and are safe for the tool. And if you connect your ammeter inline, it's worth mentioning the following:

$5 multimeters are rated for 5A (10A best case). Likely, unfused. All measurements should be done with a red lead in the 5A/10A terminal. If you use incorrect modes (e.g. mA), or a wrong terminal, it violates your multimeter manual. You'll likely fry your tool or blow a multimeter fuse. In this case you'll see odd readings, or just the ""OL"" label on the screen. Modern cars pull 10A+ easily when you wake up modules, e.g. when you disturb the circuit by installing your multimeter inline."

Oil changes, you should have done as scheduled, just like normal. But because it’s burning oil, you NEED to check regularly and top off between changes. If you run out of oil, your engine will be destroyed. 

How much oil is it burning? Are you adding a quart of oil every 1,000 miles? More, less?"

Misfires can be fuel related, too. EX: A bad or clogged injector, or line.

Misfires can be caused by mechanical issues within the engine. EX: A valve that is no longer opening and closing properly.

You can try swapping the fuel injector from #4 to a different cylinder, and see if the problem moves with it.

If the problem stays on number 4, and you're sure that the new plugs and coils are working properly, then you probably need to be looking at the cylinder health.

A leak-down test would be the easiest way to determine if you have a physical issue that needs addressing.

And my car situation:

* Window seals are shot - windows won't roll down without getting stuck on deteriorating rubber, leaving glue residue on glass
* Windows have been closed for MONTHS due to this issue (have been too strapped to fix at this time)
* NO visible water intrusion in cabin, roof, anywhere.
* Already changed cabin air filter (helped slightly but smell persists)
* No visible signs of mold/damage anywhere I can see

Could mold be growing inside the door panels or other hidden areas due to the bad seals, even without visible water damage? The chemical or mold smell (I can't figure out what) is strong enough that it's transferring to my clothes/body after driving.

**Questions:**

1. Can deteriorating window seals cause mold growth in hidden areas even without obvious leaks?
2. What are other possible sources of chemical smells I should check?
3. Should I be looking inside door panels somehow?
4. Any DIY ways to locate the source before taking it to a shop?

In the past year, I've replaced the battery, alternator, starter, serpentine belt, spark plugs, air filter, crankshaft sensor, and camshaft sensor. 

Earlier this year, my car randomly died one day in the parking lot of my job. It had previously been working fine, but suddenly wouldn't start even when we attempted to jump it off. I also remember my brake being incredibly stiff. My mom even called out a mobile mechanic to give it a look, but they didn't do much of anything and it still didn't work. Miraculously, after about 3 days, it started up and has been working without any issues up until about a month ago. I had driven 50 miles that day and didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. Next thing I know, I'm rolling up to a busy intersection ACTIVELY pressing the gas to accelerate forward. All of a sudden, my car stopped accelerating. Instead, it began to roll backwards. I immediately turned on my hazard lights and braked to avoid rolling into the car behind me. Now, I did notice that when I lost acceleration, I also lost all tension in the gas pedal (Not sure if it's worth noting!). I also lost power steering and my brake became stiff. Thankfully, someone stopped and helped me roll my car into the parking lot right next to where I broke down. He was truly an angel in disguise. I ended up getting my car towed back to my house the next day. 

My boyfriend has tried scanning it for codes and has replaced several parts as mentioned earlier in this post. It's been a month now and we still don't know what's wrong with it. I've considered towing it to a shop or trying to find a mobile mechanic, but at this point, I'm not too sure anyone will be able to diagnose the problem, let alone get it resolved.

THE COMPUTER WILL SHOW YOU A HIGHER PRICE FOR THE LUXURY BRAND!!!! It's the exact same part number, but for the luxury owner it's 20% more expensive. It's all a racket and it should be illegal. But that's how it is. If you call a Toyota dealership and give a Lexus VIN, the VVT solenoid is $350, but if you give a Toyota VIN the VVT solenoid is $285 but it's the same part number for the same fucking engine. It's like that at AutoZone, O'Reillys, Napa, and even on Rockauto. 

And yes, the regular grade fuel will reduce engine performance and fuel efficiency, the ONLY difference between the three fuel grades is how resistant it is to ""auto-ignition"" or something more commonly known as pre-detonation, ignition knock, or pinging. It's something that occurs in higher compression ratio engines when the octane rating of the fuel is too low. Basically before the piston reaches the top of its stroke, the fuel and air mixture explodes before the spark plug ignites it and the piston has to keep squeezing that explosion so the crankshaft can continue rotating. It causes excessive rod bearing wear, wrist pin wear, can crack the crankshaft, crack the piston, damages the piston rings, and creates vertical scoring in the upper portion of the cylinder walls. It's extremely bad for the engine. That's what the knock sensors are there for, they detect this ignition knock and the PCM uses that data to adjust the injector volume, and timing, and if the engine has VVT, it will adjust the valve timing so the exhaust valve closes after the piston has already started the compression stroke, reducing the compression ratio, reducing the fuel efficiency, and with the excess fuel in the exhaust, it causes the catalytic converter temperature to be much higher."

1nqddbi,Subaru car problems mystery,"Hello everyone! ive never posed on this sub, so im not quite sure where to start. For context I drive a 2012 Subaru Outback and recently I had to have it towed because of issues that somewhat suddenly started happening.

It all started around the beginning of this year, while I was driving to school my car suddenly jerked forward and then backwards after I accelerated from a stop. I thought my issue had to do with be being low on gas so I went and got a full tank, after that the problem did not fix itself, and of course, my parents first question was ""did you put diesel in the tank?"" (I didn't). After that I went to auto zone to get a diagnostic and everything came back somewhat normal, voltage was running in a higher range than normal, however, it said there were problems with my ECM (electronic control module). Since there was nothing I could do until I returned home from college I continued driving it with the sudden jerk forward and backwards whenever I accelerated from a stop. Over the summer my dad had his mechanic over to look at my car, mechanic did a diagnostic and said nothing was wrong with my ECM so they fixed everything else- spark plugs, battery, breaks, air conditioning, etc.. (despite not having issues with these things) and they told me the issue was fixed, but it persisted, I kept bringing it up but nobody believed that it was a problem, a few days after the mechanic saw my car the battery died, so we went to get a new one, then a day later that battery died, so we got a new one and have not had problems with the battery since. I continued driving my car over the summer without any incidents besides the jerking, until Tuesday. On Tuesday morning I was driving 5 minutes to school and my car suddenly jerked forward and backwards a bit more violently than it usually does, and then it went haywire, check engine light came on, traction stopped working, brake light was flashing, and the oil at temp light started flashing. Since I was only another minute away from my school parking Lot I drove it there and parked it, called my parents crying and told them about the issues. they told me to check the oil so I went to class and came back a few hours later to check it, not zero oil but I was definitely low on oil, so me and my roommates went and got oil, and then put oil in my car, while they were there they also did a diagnostic, three codes popped up P0700, P2764, and P2762. I thought the issue was resolved so I started driving home until everything went haywire again, at that point I parked my car in a random parking lot, turned it off and called my parents, they then decided to have my car taken to a mechanic so they called a tow and that is where my car is sitting until Friday-monday when they can do a diagnostic.

so im just wondering if anyone who's familiar with cars has any idea what the issue could be? none of these problems seem related to me but I don't know anything about cars, I would be interested in hearing any feedback or possible answers.

1npwlz3,Surrendering my truck because of problems with no help form warranty,"Hopefully I can get help on this big problem that came up. I know that I made a big mistake but I had to make this decision because I had no other options. So, 2 months ago my car broke down and had to get a new vehicle to drive. Car had been already in 2 accidents which weren’t my fault and I did end up getting paid but just 2 moths ago I sent it to the junkyard as there was nothing I could do to it.

I had also put new tires to that car 3 days before the car broke down, so I was stuck with paying $1,300 for those tires. Before sending the car to the junkyard I took the tires and the rims to try and sell them somewhere else. It has been 2 damn months and I just finally sold the tires for $300. That’s another big problem too cause I just only got $300 out of these wheels but I’m stuck paying the rest.

Now, the truck that I just got 2 months ago also had a problem with the engine and other problems with the dashboard showing messages of other things that had to be fixed. Was planning to take the truck to a mechanic to get it checked but literally the next day the truck wouldn’t turn on. No messages of engine or anything like that, it had other things related to monitoring systems and other things that I don’t remember but nothing showed an engine light. But now it’s been 2 weeks since I had send my truck to a Chevy Dealership to get it check and don’t seems to get any progress on this. 

Warranty seems to not want to pay, I had made a decision because I need a new vehicle and not I’m here with this problem. I don’t know if I can go through that hassle and been going through so many thing this years. Feel exhausted and tired and when I try to ask for help, people just seem to laugh it out here in the subreddit. 

I might have to surrender the truck. Made some calls today and I don’t know what other options would I have. Called the Loan and they said that I would still have to make payments but they would help me out with surrendering my truck. In the first place I wouldn’t even think about doing all this, but after seeing that the dealership fked me with a truck that failed me just after 2 months after getting it, I feel like I don’t want to continue paying a truck that came with so much problems in just 2 months. We did check the truck and everything looked good with it, but turns out all of this happened. 

What could be my options here? I’m stuck with all of this problems, I could have make the payments with no more trouble but now I have all of this problems coming in.

1npw9yq,HELP!,"Back in February I brought my vehicle (2018 Chevy Equinox Premier) into an auto repair shop, it started throwing random brake type service alerts. They replaced the battery sensor. I went 7 months no problem. 

Well recently took it in for an oil change. I had a screeching noise under my seat occurring for the last year. It never actually affected anything except my patience so I wasn’t too worried. When they did the oil change I asked them to look at it. They said it was the Rear USB port wire shorting. So they replaced that $5xx. 

I got my car back and anytime my car went into auto stop it threw a bunch of service alerts and went away if I turned it off or started accelerating (similar to the issue in February). Then I noticed a puddle of orange fluid under my vehicle. 

They had me come back in and then said my battery needed to be replaced and my car was dry as a bone. Pictures also backed that up but no explanation on the mysterious orange fluid in our garage. 

I picked my car up and as soon as I turned it on…. Check engine light. Which was the one thing that never came on. I went in and the guy comes out and says oh it just needs to be reset after a battery change. I was in no mood to argue but I told my fiancé I will bet it comes back in the morning. 

Well wouldn’t you know yesterday morning it was shining bright like a diamond. He called them and told them to bring me a loaner and come get my car or we are taking it elsewhere at their expense, and they did. They said they are going to inspect it with a fine tooth comb. 

They called him and said that it’s throwing a bunch of codes all over the vehicle and they think it’s electrical but they are trying to pinpoint where.

Today around 3pm they call and tell my fiancé that my battery voltage dramatically decreased and alternator shut off on a test drive so they were keeping my car again. Not even one hour later I get a call saying my vehicle is ready to go. They can’t get any codes to show up and have test drove it 6 times with no issues. However they did ZERO work! So tell me how it goes from electrical issues to battery/alternator to perfect condition with no work?!

Also the call me at 4 to pick up my vehicle. I had plans after work and my child has an appointment tomorrow morning at 8. They need the loaner vehicle by 8 because they booked it for someone else already. 

Here’s the question what do I do at this point? I have zero confidence I am picking up my car in good condition. How can I keep this on them? I am almost positive my car is a time bomb and I refuse to pay that bill after sticking nearly $2000 into these issues already.

A bad battery can cause check engine lights (CEL) to come on due to low voltage not allowing the computer to properly process signals or the signal itself being bad. 

What this is more likely to be is a dirty or malfunctioning mass airflow sensor, bad O2 sensor, or an exhaust leak. Most of this I’d say doesn’t need a shop to figure it out if you know someone with some mechanical knowledge. Clean the MAF sensor, check the O2 sensor signal on the scan tool, and just look at your exhaust for a leak. I understand questioning the shops work, but if you want to ease your mind you can check the batter terminals, clean them off, put on some grease specifically for battery posts, and reconnect them real tight to make sure it’s not a contact issue. 

Another option is the code was just something random and it’ll take a few drive cycle to clear itself, but don’t bet on that being the problem. To answer whether or not you can drive it, yes you can for now without issue, but expect it to drive poorly and smell odd."

I was recently at the Hyundai dealership getting and alignment, and they said that my rotors are pitted and need to be replaced.  I took the wheels off and looked at them myself. The car is 2016 Hyundai Sonata, 2.4l engine, with over 110K miles. To my knowledge, these were never replaced on it.

I looked online and the pitted rotors that were mentioned- my rotors are still not at that point yet. Some of them have little pits but what is  more concerning is the amount of rust. In theory, will this rust impede braking performance? Also, some of the rotors have ""trench lines"" going across them.

Can I drive on these more time or should this get addressed asap? I am thinking that the latter is the way to go.

The sparking you saw before was a loose/burnt connection barely making contact. That’s why it would “work” sometimes. Now there’s no spark because the wire or terminal is cooked and not carrying power at all. The car won’t come out of park because the shift interlock solenoid isn’t getting the power it needs from that circuit.


What I'd do is first inspect the ignition switch connector. If the plastic or pins are melted, that’s your failure. Then test that wire with a multimeter, you should see 12V with the key in RUN. If not, the problem is upstream (ignition switch or fuse). If yes but it doesn’t carry through, that wire/terminal is bad.

Replace the cooked wire/terminal with the correct gauge and a new pin (don’t just tape it). Ford sells pigtail connectors for this exact repair. If the ignition switch itself looks burnt, replace it too, that's a very common failure on these."

1nqf0ne,Transmission Needs Replacement After Clean Maintenance Inspection,"I will start by disclaiming I am not a ""car guy"" and a complete novice when it comes to overall maintenance and necessary service. I know this was not responsible of me as a vehicle owner. Nonetheless, in the past, I have completely relied on the shops I have taken it to for routine service and my vehicle's alert lights to tell me when there is an issue. I brought my 2015 Ford Fusion with 150k miles on it into my local dealership this past January for a battery replacement and they performed a maintenance inspection as well. I picked up my car and it seemed like there was no problem. Fast forward 6 months and out of nowhere, my transmission fails on the highway forcing me to pull over and get a tow home. After some youtube education, I learned that my car had been experiencing a slipping transmission for a few months, which I just thought was sluggish acceleration due to my car being older. After bringing it to another local shop, I discover that supposedly the transmission fluid had been low and burnt for a while and that my transmission needs replacement ($6000 repair, greater than the cost of the car) due to driving with low fluid for so long. I am incredibly frustrated because I had been relying on the dealership and the vehicle to inform me of these kinds of issues. I also bought the car used when it had 80k miles on it and did not inquire whether the transmission fluid was recently cycled at time of purchase. Of course, I know I should have been a more responsible vehicle owner and been knowledgeable enough to ask those questions and identify the transmission slippage when it first began, but to me this issue feels like it came out of nowhere after a recently passed maintenance inspection. I have also brought this car into the same dealership several times in the past couple years and no transmission issues were ever communicated to me. Do I have any right or recourse to challenge the dealership that had given me all those maintenance inspections without telling me that I had a failing transmission that is now damaged beyond repair? Is it even worth it to reach out to them? It feels childish to expect that they would help cover the cost of the replacement, but I just feel so blindsided by this. I appreciate any responses that could give me some advice on what my best course of action would be here. On a related note, if anyone has any economic used car recommendations I would welcome those as well!

Got a 2003 Subaru Baja from somebody looking to get rid of it. It ran, but had a few issues. 280,000 miles and a new head gasket. Figured it would be a fun project until I could either throw a new motor in it or get sick of it enough to get rid of it. 

Has a rough idle and was throwing codes for the IAC valve. Threw in a new battery and new IAC valve, cleaned the throttle body. It still had a rough idle, but not as bad. Ended up dying on the road. Got it back home and it wouldn't even turn over. The car turns on fine when it's jumped, but as soon as I take the cables off it dies. Tested the battery with a multimeter and it was coming back dead. Figured bad battery/alternator/parasitic drain. Tested for a drain and found one in the auto locks, so I pulled the fuse and fixed the drain readings. Put in a new alternator, then took the battery to O'Reilly to get it tested and/or swapped and they said the battery was good. 

Now I'm stumped. It's still throwing codes for the IAC valve. I think my next step is changing out the MAF sensor since I've seen that can cause a rough idle and throw codes for the IAC valve. Would like to try to work it myself before bringing it somewhere, but if it's something to do with the wiring harness then I probably won't touch it. Any input would be great.

I’m in MA, and my car inspection expires at the end of September, so I’m kind of in a bind.

A few weeks ago, the battery on my 2017 Jetta (manual) started to die (the car needed to be jumped to start). As the battery died, lots of warning lights came on. I was due for an inspection, so I figured that I’d have a mechanic replace the battery and complete the inspection. We had the battery replaced and the warning lights were still on, so they (understandably) wouldn’t pass it. The mechanic said to drive it 60 miles and they would go away. 

Since then, I have driven 300+ miles. I have tried the VW specific reset for this (turn the wheel lock to lock left to right, car moving and stationary). I also disconnected the negative terminal of the battery for 2 days. The lights are still on. 

The lights are really everything: abs, low tire pressure, etc. so I think it’s an electronics issue. 

Should I take it back to the mechanic? Or to the VW dealer? Or is there something I can do?",1,1758805829.0,2,AskMechanics,1758915136,2025-09-25 13:10:29,2025-09-26 19:32:16,"lantrick (Score: 2): I wouldn't take it back to the same mechanic.

/////////////////////// English ///////////////////////  


  
  
I just wanted to hear your opinion before I start writing bad reviews etc.  
Jeg ville lige høre jeres mening, inden jeg srider til dårlige andmeldelser mv.

The case is that I have an older car that was hit by a colleague at work. The other party's insurance takes responsibility and I take the car to a workshop (Automester Rødekro) to have a new door + front screen replaced and installed (they tell me the case is valued at 25,000+)

I will then pick up the car at the workshop, where they have carried out the repairs.

When I drop off the car, all the window regulators work as they should, but when I go to pick up the car I am told that the window regulator has been worn and rusty and has therefore broken during the replacement of the car door. They also say that because the window regulator is a wearing part, it can happen during the replacement of the door and they therefore will not fix this.

My question is therefore, is it really possible that because the window regulator is a wear part, can they really afford to hand over a car where the window regulator no longer works solely due to their repair?

I have of course asked the workshop how much it would cost to have it replaced, to which they replied that it would cost 2600 if they had to replace the wire itself.

Now I have checked the price of this window regulator myself, which costs between 200 and 500 kr, so I immediately think it is completely grotesque to have to pay 2600 because the window regulator was worn / rusty and therefore destroyed.

The mechanic also said that he had been in the situation many times, but the insurance will not cover this because it is a wear part. But shouldn't one make reservations for this, if they know that this is one of the common consequences of changing a new car door?

Many thanks in advance for your help

Sagen er den jeg har en ældre bil, der blev påkørt af en kollega på arbejde. Modpartens forsikring tager ansvaret og jeg aflevere bilen på værksted (Automester Rødekro) For at få skiftet og sat en ny dør + skærm foran (de fortæller mig sagen er vurderet til 25.000+)

Jeg skal herefter hente bilen på værkstedet, hvor de har udført reperationerne.

Da jeg aflevere bilen virker alle rudehejs som de skal, men da jeg skal afhente bilen får jeg at vide, at rudehejset har været slidt og rusten og er derfor gået i stykker under skift af bildøren. De siger desuden at grundet rudehejset er en sliddel, kan det ske under skift af døren og de derfor ikke vil ordne dette.

Mit spørgsmål er derfor, om det virkelig kan passe, at på grund af rudehejset er en sliddel om de virkelig kan tilladde sig at aflevere en bil hvor rudehejset ikke længere virker udelukkende grundet deres reperation?

Jeg har naturligvis forhørt mig på værkstedet, hvad det ville koste at få den skiftet, hvortil de svarer det vil koste 2600 hvis de skal skifte selve wiren.

Nu har jeg selv tjekket prisen på dette rudehejs der koster mellem 200 og 500 kr, så jeg synes umidlbart det er fuldstændig grotesk at skulle betale 2600 fordi rudehejset var slidt / rusten og det derfor blev ødelagt.

Mekanikeren sagde desuden han havde været i situationen mange gange, men forsikringen vil ikke dække dette da det er sliddelle. Men burde man ikke tage forbehold for netop dette, hvis de netop ved dette er en af de alm. konsekvenser af skift af ny bildør?

Did you not have comprehensive car insurance? If you did, then you need to speak to them. If not, then your only real options are:
1) getting a bank loan.
2) speak to your employer.
3) ask family/friends (not complete strangers) if they can help out or loan you a vehicle.
4) rent a vehicle

Ultimately you're going to have to take this situation as a life lesson on why having adequate insurance is of vital importance. Any good car insurance should offer a courtesy car regardless of who is at fault. So whatever vehicle you get next is going to need a good comprehensive insurance policy.

If you get a car insurance policy that doesn't cover you for the full value of any loan you have secured against the vehicle, then you will also require GAP insurance so you aren't left out of pocket when a vehicle is totalled."

Sorry if this seems like a UKPersonalFinance post, but thought it was better suited on CarTalk as I don’t just view my car(s) as an A to B. 

So I used to have a 1L Toyota Yaris as a first car - great till I started making motorway journeys more often, at which point overtaking was virtually impossible and journeys felt arduous. 

So I did what all immature students with too much money do. Being the badge snob I am, went and bought a BMW 2013 116i at 60k miles from a Wembley medium sized dealer with part service history (I know I know…). 

Car was great in comparison to the Yaris, but was by all means a pov spec bmw. I spent time learning about the car, replaced halogens for LED DRLs, added a larger screen w/Carplay, spent north of £1000 adding a full component sound system, sound deadening, etc as well as ambient lighting (by no means does this mean I skimped out on maintenance). 

Now after 2.5 years… it’s just problem after problem. I’ve spent £2000+ fixing various coolant / oil leaks, replacing charge pipe, solenoids, sparks & coils, you name it. Now after all that engine work, mechanic advising that flywheel & clutch is on its way out - and turbo will go too in the next year or so (very slight play currently). I know this is going to be a £3000+ bill, I just can’t justify spending that on a MAX £4000 car in my head. 

The problem is - I’ve made great memories in that car. Going around the UK with my girlfriend, banging out music at night with my friends - driving our shitboxes together, etc, so I’m struggling to let go. 

Looking at going back to a Yaris 20 (albeit a 1.33 as I can’t live with the 1L) for the next two years whilst I save up - and once I’m comfortable financially buy something actually nice, like a 2016 S3 Saloon or similar.

Diesel is a dirty fuel. Diesel engines are not designed to be driven in short distances and slow revs. I’ve seen excessive cases of buildups that required the engine to be demounted.

1nq4qzo,"Clio ETECH 1.6, Toyota Yaris Hybrid, or ID.3?","Good afternoon all,

I’m looking at a new (used) car early next year after a string of failures with my current and ageing car, a 2014 Vauxhall Corsa D (1.2L petrol). My budget is about 15k, the new car around 3-4 years old in early 2026 (I’d go with 5 if the spec was right), under 35k miles and with good fuel economy or lower running costs than my current car. 

The gripes I have with my current car are lack of power on hills (I do a lot of driving to the Lake District, about a 200-250 mile round trip at least once a month), small boot space for shopping, lack of space for a potential future family, and poor fuel economy. 

The Yaris seemed to initially tick a lot of boxes for me, but the boot space is the one thing putting me off. As for the ID.3, I’ve never driven an EV before but it seems like the most cost efficient option as I can charge at home, with low running costs and good boot space. My only real issue is charging en route on Lake District trips and the occasional trip further afield on holidays etc. 

The Clio ETECH hybrid has recently come onto my radar as a possible option which seemingly ticks all boxes, though they’re a less common car and I can’t find a lot online about long-term reliability (I believe they’re Renault’s first hybrid?) 

Any thoughts from you folks here about the most suitable car?

1npzyiq,Rejecting a car within 6 months,"I purchased a car recently and within the first two months engine management lights came on. I got the car scanned and diagnosed the faults. I then contacted the dealer to give them the opportunity to fix said faults all via email with pictures of the readouts.

Longer answer (I have done this!!!) --

They will try and fuck you over at every turn. Get independent reports signed and dated by 3rd party mechanics, don't let them attempt repair again (as they have already done so). Just note down the time and date of first repair and give the finance company the independent report showing the faults are still happening.

Then they may reject your claim (they often reject on the first time round). Escalate to their complaints service (will likely get rejected) then to the ombudsman and provided you have the evidence of their first attempt at repair and the 3rd party reports your complaint should be accepted.

It may depend on if it's the same fault as before.

ProfessorPrize9842 (Score: 1): I’m having this same issue, bought the car in feb and 5 days into owning it all sorts of lights came up and a do not drive thing came up. Anyway it went to the dealership for “diagnostics” and turns out that means diagnose and fix and so they fixed the car without my knowledge and deemed me unable to reject the car as it was the wet belt that was gone. 

Anyway skip forward to this week, it’s been in for diagnostics again and it needs a new engine likely because the wet belt failing caused the oil stump to fill up with debris. Anyway I was lucky enough to have complained to the finance company as soon as it happened and escalated it to the financial ombudsman too who ruled with the finance company but they both upheld my complaint in full. 
Obviously now I have a full complaint with them and I guess they are investigating but Arnold Clark refuse to give me my diagnostics report for evidence to the finance company. I have made the complaint to them and said Arnold Clark are obstructing my rights to provide evidence in terms of my final rejection"
1npzkfp,Should I sell my car and buy a cheap banger?,"So I currently have a Kia Optima (3) estate 2018 model worth around 5/6k. Nice car have had it since January this year, bought for 7.5k. It has 99k currently.

wait_whats_this (Score: 11): Given how your current car isn't exactly worth a fortune, and it suits your needs, and assuming it is mechanically sound, I would strongly consider keeping it. 

First reason is that you lose money on every transaction. You'll never sell your car for what it's worth, you'll always buy a car that is overpriced (dealers make money). Second is that at the values we're talking about, an unexpected repair will easily wipe out the ""new"" car. Do you have the savings to handle that?

I'm all for manipulating existing assets to maximise convenience and so on, but in this case I feel like the most likely scenario is pain.

1npwnw4,2nd hand Toyota Yaris,"Hi all,

I'm new to the UK and currently looking to buy a second-hand Toyota Yaris. I'm also a new driver and have never owned a car before. 

I recently went to test drive a Yaris with my husband (a bit of an impulsive move).  This is the car we tested :

The car seemed to drive fine, but there was a very strong smoke smell inside. Neither of us knows much about cars, so I'm hoping to get some advice from this group.

A few questions:

1) The listing mentions a 3-month dealer warranty, but the car was only registered in December 2024. Shouldn’t there still be some of the original Toyota warranty left?

2) Is it possible (or easy) to remove a strong cigarette smoke smell from a car?

3) What key things should we be looking out for when buying a second-hand car, especially as first-time buyers?

2. It can be done, yes. An o-zone generator will work wonders for it but the fabrics might need a clean. 


3. This barely qualifies as a used car since it's so new, but it should've at least had its first service done so be sure and check that. Carry out an HPI check (I like Parkers, https://parkers.hpicheck.com/) to check for outstanding finance or any registered issues.


Big Motoring World have a checkered reputation, but then so do all the big car supermarkets. If in doubt, engage a mechanic to do a pre purchase inspection. It'll cost you about £100.
