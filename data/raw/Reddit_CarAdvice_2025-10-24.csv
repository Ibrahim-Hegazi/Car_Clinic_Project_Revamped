1oej0yk,Should i be concerned with this smoke that came from my car?,"https://preview.redd.it/sk76ziw18ywf1.jpg?width=1281&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49a9338bf64e5cc8fab85be8e34eac2dfdc5bdb2

My friend took this photo when i reved my car, which clearly shows it thorwing smoke.   
The car is a 1986 IROC-Z with a 5.7 with a carb swap  
as far as im aware when i drive there is no smoke and when its reved when im driving i don¬¥t think it throws smoke.   
when we took this photo before we had the car idling for like 30-40 minutes so idk if that had something to do with it. but the next day before we drove we checked the oil and it was super low (like 1.5quarts to full) and i haven¬¥t driven enough to know if it is truely burning oil since i don¬¥t have plates yet. so i want to know if this is normal or if its something I should be concerned about. any help is welcomed thank you.",1,1761263517.0,4,MechanicAdvice,1761334526,2025-10-23 23:51:57,2025-10-24 19:35:26,"cmdrmcgarrett (Score: 1): its oil burning

1oej0ye,"Friends dad says I ""broke his cv axle"" after I tried to do his lower control arm","So my friends dad needed a new lower control arm. The front bushing was crumbling and the guy had been driving around on it for about 20 miles and he said the wheel was shaking badly. So I gave it a shot. He had a part that he'd gotten off carports dot com that he got in a big kit for really cheap, obviously I'd rather he'd have gotten a better part but I figured the worst that could happen was the bushings would go out in 5-10k miles. 

He had me set up in the parking lot of a religious organization, about an hour into the job the owner came by and told me he hadn't asked permission like he was supposed to and that I had to be out of there for an event at 3. Guy was very nice and understanding, I apologized for the mixup. I put the old control arm back on and took it to rock auto. I haven't done a lot of these so it took me longer than I'd like. Shoutout to autozone employees for being so cool about me working on a car in their lot.

The next 4 hours involved me doing a combination of hammering and pushing with the jack to try and get this part in. It just wouldn't go. After fighting with until I literally couldn't hold a tool anymore I took it and compared it with the old arm. It looked like it was maybe a half inch shorter, the ball joint looked like it was at a slightly different angle, and it looked like the welded piece that at the end toward the ball joint didn't match up and has some funny looking welds on it.

I was so mad i put the keys in the sun visor, told his wife what had happened and where the car was,  (they live a couple minutes walk from auto zone) and told them to get a tow truck. The light was fading fast and i had no strength to put the old one on. I put my tools away, put the car on the ground, where it was sitting right about where it should be with maybe an extra degree of castor to the rear.

The next morning the guy accuses me of ""breaking the (cv) axle"" telling me that there was oil leaking out of it and acted as if I hadn't updated his wife at all. He send me a picture of a perfectly intact car with a few drips on the car, it looked like maybe the seal between the cv and the differential was going out and a few drops had leaked on the ground. Everything looked totally fine.

He was absolutely incensed that I couldn't complete the job. He accused me of ""putting all the weight on the axle"" when u lowered the car. I already asked one mechanic and he said that's basically impossible, and that use a McPherson strut suspension can temporarily handle being on the ground without a control arm as long as you don't try to drive it. I'm probably going to call a couple more as I rely hate to think I messed up this guy's car, but everything looked fine in the pic he sent me.

I offered to come up and put the old control arm on but he didn't want anything to do with me.

 They're from the purportedly reputable Paramount Performance and in 4-2-1 configuration. The other two pics are of a set which an enthusiast in the community known as Caldoofy had custom made, he made them available after getting them sorted on his own car.

I recently brought in my 2018 c63s for upgrades. The motor had just ticked over to 70k. The car was in perfect working order when it was dropped off. They had done upgrades the year before so I thought it was alright to go back to them for another stage. The car is not under any warranty or anything.

Company A does hardware installation and primarily runs the shop around here where I live in Eastern Canada. They get Company B to come in from Calgary for the electronic tuning.

  
I was told back in June that it would take a few days for the upgrades. Here we are now, several months later, and I have a broken engine and a huge bill for a new motor.

During the time it was there, they admitted to blowing a brand-new turbo I bought to have installed, and it managed to get into the engine, and now they want to charge me $20k CAD for a new motor. 

  
My question is, who is responsible for this damage? I tried having a civil conversation with them, but they just kept saying, ""It's no one's fault"". I asked around locally and everyone says it seems odd.

Is there not insurance on either Company A or Company B's end (or even the turbo manufacturer). Should I seek legal advice over something like this? And if so, what kind of lawyer?

But the key switch in the back on the rear window itself works for the window but only goes up! Not down. The down button will not work. I thought maybe its stuck? So i bypassed the wires so Down is Up and Up is Down. And it worked the window went down. So I am guessing the switch is bad?

P0336 - Crankshaft Position Sensor

P0335 - Crankshaft position signal issue

Symptoms:
Every other start throws a CEL for P0607 or P0336. When CEL present it misfires. When starts without CEL there‚Äôs no misfire.

Driving:
Wobble in RPMs. Dodgy shifting. Sometimes shudder. When coming to a stop I get a brief AT Oil Temp light flash. 

Starting the engine:
Left in ON position for 10s prior to starting - starts fine. If I try to start right away - turns over the engine multiple times before it starts. Sometimes I get a rapid clicking sounds coming from the EGR valve I believe.

THINGS I HAVE DONE SO FAR:
1. New battery - the old one was 8yo
2. New crankshaft position sensor - no change in symptoms. Old crankshaft position sensor is working fine (checked resistivity).

1oebp84,New post about my 2017 Chevy Tahoe that I‚Äôve been trying to work out but came to no conclusion with warranty company.,"Hello, I have been trying to get to a conclusion for this problem that I‚Äôve had for over a month with my 2017 Chevy Tahoe that I‚Äôve financed 3 months ago and still haven‚Äôt gotten to any conclusion. Need help taking a look at everything else. I have posted a video and from what I‚Äôve been said, people have told me that engine mounts are shorter because it looks like the engine moves quite a lot, so I would also need some advise on that. 

But as of today I have received some photos of the oil pan that was checked as asked by the warranty and it does look like there are metal shavings right there in the oil. Since the beginning of trying to get a claim going for this vehicle, everything has been canceled by this warranty company. Mechanic has stated that there was a sound in the engine and recommend me to do a tear down of the engine to check what the problem was. He also stated that it could also be a possible problem for a failed lifter and wanted to check the whole engine for that problem and the nose in the engine. Engine does move allot.

The warranty for whatever reason, made me do 2 leak down tests and other diagnostics to whip nothing came out negative but form what they had told me, it was a failed lifter problem. Also stated that it was a TSB 19-NA 219 which they have been working on on other vehicles that they have. I talked with the mechanic and told them about this. Since the beginning the mechanic told me that all of those tests and diagnostics were useless and that he didn‚Äôt understand why they wanted them to be done. There was a noice and wanted to check the engine since the beginning. 

Now like I said Ive done the financing 3 month or more than 3 months and 3 months in of financing I faced the problem my Tahoe. 2 months in my truck stopped working and I was about to take it to do some check ups because I had a bunch of messages showing up on the dashboard. That was before my Tahoe failing and not being able to turn it on or get it running. It‚Äôs been more than a month without getting the issue fixed and the warranty had been dragging this for so long. 

Went through 2 leak down tests and twice the diagnostics done for nothing. And now the mechanic checked the oil pan and there were metal shavings showing. I have the photos. So based on the do I maybe need the engine to be checked or what‚Äôs the damn problem? I have read on Reddit and everything and it does say that this is a big issue for the engine, so what am I supposed to do? 

I have the warranty and they only seem to be dragging everything. It has been said from the beginning that the engine needed to be checked and the warranty asked me for twice of the same test and now I‚Äôm facing with the issue that there is metal shaving in the oil. This has to be related to the engine noice and having an engine problem or is it not related at all?

Your extended warranty company doesn't want to hear ""we think it's a lifter"" they want to know what the indefinite cause of failure is so they can determine if that is a covered component under your plan. 

This is why they have the customer authorize the teardown - so if it's not a covered component, they're not liable. 

Your first, and possibly biggest mistake was not taking the vehicle back to wherever you bought it from.

Post the work being done we‚Äôve been driving for a week and had a few odd occurrences of the car not going into gear properly. Thought this might have just been down to it being a fresh clutch and not being used to it.

Fast forward to this morning and the car will now not go into gear at all. Had it towed back to the garage (¬£80) and they were looking into it.

What IF -- The linkage is frayed, and it's frayed inside the loom, so it's not noticeable.  What IF that frayed linkage actually contributed to the old clutch going bad?

Shops get clutch jobs all the time.  If the linkage was frayed but not visible it could have been easily overlooked.

Occam's Razor to me says ... The linkage frayed to the point where it damaged your old clutch, and when they installed the new clutch, the adjusted and everything ""seemed fine"" until you returned, at which point they needed to scratch there heads and say hmmmmmm there's an underlying issue here.

Return trips to the shop are common for this reason.  A lot of times, replacing a bad component will reveal WHY the component went bad in the first place :).  Your optimism should remain intact my friend!

I've checheck valve clearances, ignition, cleaned the carbs twice (ultra souds and compressed air, membranes are new), boots are new, compression is spot on. 
It's really awful riding on low speeds because it's like running with half an engine, half the pulses and it can be heard on idle.

Now, I think it's a carburator problem. It has the factory/standar jets. Is it possible that they need new jets with the same size because of degradation? Or just the correct size to obtain a brownish spark plug? All the jets are cleaned and seemed in good condition.

[Background, feel free to skip to next paragraph] I live in Winnipeg and our winter here can get very bad and me and my girlfriend wanted to feel safe and get a practical car especially that she is moving offices further away from our apartment and would need to take the highway more. I am responsible for paying for car insurance, gas, and a smaller portion of the rent between my girlfriend and I. I have a 2014 brz and my girlfriend recently got a 2025 chevy trax.

My last oil change was 4000kms ago. I‚Äôve seen some people say they don‚Äôt bother changing the oil before storage. I have also seen people say they don‚Äôt disconnect the battery. Some people say over-inflate the tires and some inflate it to oem spec. I know that I should fill up the gas and put fuel stabilizer in.

We have underground parking so the brz will stay there over the winter if that makes a difference. Will be switching my car insurance to layup in 3 weeks.

If it was my own car - I'd pull the battery and bring it inside for the winter.  If you have ethanol free. fuel in your area I'd run a tank through and leave it full.  If you don't then I'd fill it with fuel and add an appropriate amount of Sta-Bil that is designed for ethanol fuels.  

No real need to change the oil now but if you can change it shortly after bringing it back to life that would be good.  The big issue there is that you'll have moisture condense and drip in to the oil over the winter."

Huh? Why?

Just put it in neutral and take your foot off of the clutch.

Use the brake pedal to keep the car stopped. If the hill is too steep to take off without rolling back (and your car doesn't have brake hold), use the handbrake to keep the car stopped while going through the take off process with the clutch and throttle (or use heel-toe to operate the brake pedal and throttle at the same time).

Standing on the clutch pedal for long periods of time can accelerate the wear of the throwout bearing and can accelerate the wear or cause glazing of the clutch plate / flywheel.

When you step on the clutch pedal, the throwout bearing is driven against the clutch cover pressure springs, releasing the pressure they put on the clutch disk.

The clutch disk isn't physically forced away from the flywheel, it's just not pressed against it by the springs anymore. It has some free movement on the shaft, but it can still come into contact with the flywheel.

And if your foot loosens up a little, while it may not be able to drive the car, the clutch disk may be driven against the flywheel, and that will definitely cause it to cook.

Minor oil leaks are pretty normal at this age and mileage. Fix them if and when they become bad enough that the car is leaving oil spots on your driveway, and/or when you often have to add oil more than once between changes. Just don‚Äôt run it out of oil. 

Coolant leaks should be handled promptly.

It is likely that your thermostat is bad. You‚Äôre describing the symptoms that point to that being the issue. Regardless of whether your CEL is on. 

My advice is to change it. It‚Äôs a cheap and easy (usually) job. Also, take a picture of it before removing to note it‚Äôs direction. I‚Äôve been a mechanic my whole adult life and I still do it. I don‚Äôt like re-working anything.

It is part of a unit that you can‚Äôt put in backwards, so that‚Äôs not a concern for you. This is what I‚Äôd do next. It‚Äôs in the order of lowest cost and logical progression. 

-Make sure your air cabin filters are clean and not restricting air flow 

-Make sure system has proper amount of coolant. 

-Bleed air. (You already did this I believe)


-If you haven‚Äôt changed it yet, there‚Äôs another free test you can do which is checking the actuator for the blend door. To do that:

1. Take drive it until it‚Äôs at normal operating temperature 

2. Pull over somewhere that‚Äôs quiet (i.e. not by a busy highway)

3. Turn your radio and climate control blower (fan) off. Set climate controls to floor and defrost, and the temperature to the middle of the blue (or cool) line. 

4 Turn the blower to max setting, then turn the temperature dial to max heat and listen for an audible whine or ‚Äúthunk‚Äù sound (the whine not loud so you really have to listen). 

5. Feel the air coming from both the floor and the defrost vents, to verify that the same temperature is coming from both. 

If you don‚Äôt hear the whine or thunk, or there is different temps from the different vent outlets, the blend door is likely stuck. It controls the mix of hot/cold air that‚Äôs pushed through the vents. 

-The next thing I‚Äôd check is the water pump, looking for leakage around the pump shaft and/or listening for a whine coming from the pump. Either of those things suggest that the pump is bad. Meaning it‚Äôs not pushing enough coolant through the system, which will keep the entire system cooler and isn‚Äôt good. 

-Feel the feeder hoses to the heater core with engine at operating temp. Both should be hot. If one or both is cool, the heater core is likely blocked. You can try to flush it, or you can replace. 

If none of that works, time to have a pro look at it. 

Hope this helps!"

1oebslv,New post about my 2017 Chevy Tahoe that I've been trying to work out but came to no conclusion with warranty company.,"Hello, I have been trying to get to a conclusion for this problem that I've had for over a month with my 2017 Chevy Tahoe that I've financed 3 months ago and still haven't gotten to any conclusion. Need help taking a look at everything else. I have posted a video and from what I've been said, people have told me that engine mounts are shorter because it looks like the engine moves quite a lot, so I would also need some advise on that.

But as of today I have received some photos of the oil pan that was checked as asked by the warranty and it does look like there are metal shavings right there in the oil. Since the beginning of trying to get a claim going for this vehicle, everything has been canceled by this warranty company. Mechanic has stated that there was a sound in the engine and recommend me to do a tear down of the engine to check what the problem was. He also stated that it could also be a possible problem for a failed lifter and wanted to check the whole engine for that problem and the nose in the engine. Engine does move allot.

The warranty for whatever reason, made me do 2 leak down tests and other diagnostics to whip nothing came out negative but form what they had told me, it was a failed lifter problem. Also stated that it was a TSB 19-NA 219 which they have been working on on other vehicles that they have. I talked with the mechanic and told them about this. Since the beginning the mechanic told me that all of those tests and diagnostics were useless and that he didn't understand why they wanted them to be done. There was a noice and wanted to check the engine since the beginning.

Now like I said Ive done the financing 3 month or more than 3 months and 3 months in of financing I faced the problem my Tahoe. 2 months in my truck stopped working and I was about to take it to do some check ups because I had a bunch of messages showing up on the dashboard. That was before my Tahoe failing and not being able to turn it on or get it running. It's been more than a month without getting the issue fixed and the warranty had been dragging this for so long.

Went through 2 leak down tests and twice the diagnostics done for nothing. And now the mechanic checked the oil pan and there were metal shavings showing. I have the photos. So based on the do I maybe need the engine to be checked or what's the damn problem? I have read on Reddit and everything and it does say that this is a big issue for the engine, so what am I supposed to do?

I have the warranty and they only seem to be dragging everything. It has been said from the beginning that the engine needed to be checked and the warranty asked me for twice of the same test and now I'm facing with the issue that there is metal shaving in the oil. This has to be related to the engine noice and having an engine problem or is it not related at all?",1,1761245706.0,12,carproblems,1761334526,2025-10-23 18:55:06,2025-10-24 19:35:26,"Gilbertsballs (Score: 2): A lot of third party warranty companies will work with independent shops but for a big thing like a engine it would be best to get it diagnosed by a Chevy dealership.

Labor and material rates vary by region/market/shop.

The OEM bumper is around 600$.

Average labor to install is about 4 hours.
Looks to be a 3-stage white.
Factor about six hours of paint labor.

Most shops charge a pre - and post scan, so there is a cost for that(varies based on market/shop).

Material costs- ground coat, mid coat, top coat, primer(if an unprimed bumper), adhesion promoter, etc.

Depending on your package, this vehicle may have a radar/and / or camera in the grill, as well as radars in the sides of the bumper.

Typically, these need to be recalibrated after the bumper is removed or replaced(on some vehicles, they won't even operate after being unplugged without calibration).

May need one-time use rivets/clips/brackets replaced and/or there could be additional damage behind it.

To do it ""right"" according to Mazda, I'd be surprised to walk out of any reputable shop anywhere in the USA for less than 1200$ if not over 2000$.

But that's just a guess.

Hope this helps.

1oe32fz,Battery discharging 100% if left sitting for 3 days,"I have a 2010 Lexus ES350 which has run for 15 years with little to no problems. We‚Äôre seniors and don‚Äôt drive as frequently as we used to because of wife‚Äôs medical problems. The battery, from AAA, is less than six months old. 
Recently if the car is left undriven for 3 or 4 days, the battery completely discharges. In the past I‚Äôve been able to leave the car for easily over a week‚Äîusually much longer‚Äîwith no problems. When I have AAA road service come out to jump the battery, their diagnostics always show the battery and charging system are operating normally. I‚Äôve taken the car into a AAA service center, and after fully charging the battery and running their own diagnostics, they blame the problem on our not driving the car enough and say we need to go out every 3 or 4 days and start the car and let it run to charge up the battery up.  
I think that‚Äôs nonsense. A Google search indicates a car should be able to be left several weeks without the battery discharging to the point it won‚Äôt start. This is consistent with my 15 years‚Äô experience with this particular vehicle. 
AAA is saying they can‚Äôt find anything wrong with the car‚Äôs electrical system and have basically just thrown up their hands. 
I‚Äôm guessing there‚Äôs some kind of parasitic drain gradually drawing down the battery. I‚Äôve looked for obvious culprits like interior lights left on, etc., but don‚Äôt find anything. Does anyone have any advice on how to diagnose this problem or who to take it to?

Let the car sit undisturbed for 20 minutes, then see what the meter shows.  Should be ~50ma.  If it's a lot more, then start removing fuses, about 8 at a time, and repeat the process to zero in on the circuit that's the problem.  This or pay a shop for what could be many hours to do it.

I recently bought a 2005 4Runner SR5 with only 90,000 miles on it ‚Äî totally stock. Took it to a Toyota dealer for an inspection, and they told me my right rear wheel bearing is really bad and needs to be replaced ASAP. The sales-dude even said I shouldn‚Äôt drive more than a few hours on it.

Thing is, my partner and I can‚Äôt really tell if it‚Äôs that bad. There‚Äôs basically no play in the wheel, it feels solid, and we haven‚Äôt noticed any humming or grinding noises while driving. The only visible issue is a bit of oil/grease around the hub (you can see the difference in the pictures between right and left wheel).

We were planning a 4-hour road trip this weekend for some desert camping, and I‚Äôm pretty bummed about possibly canceling. But of course, we‚Äôll skip it if it‚Äôs truly unsafe to drive.

What do you all think ‚Äî could the dealer be exaggerating, or should we take it seriously and stay put until it‚Äôs fixed? The qoute he gave me for fixing it was also quite insane.

I just had a friend drive me home a few days ago and when I got my vehicle today everything was 100% dead not even lights.

So I'm not sure at first I wanted to just blame him but I have had to jump at once before since I bought it but that time I blamed me maybe leaving a light on still seem too short to kill the battery. 

Today I was in the vehicle while it was off and I noticed a sound kind of sounds like it's trying to lock and it's consistent pretty much every 20 seconds. In the video attached it happens at 5 seconds 25 seconds and 45 seconds. 

I also noticed on the drive today that the air is not consistent, I can get AC sometimes and heat sometimes and sometimes no air. Sometimes I'm able to trick the heat to come on by putting on Max AC while I'm driving and then switching it to heat but then it'll turn off after 10-20 minutes and I have to do that again and it doesn't always work.

I've been experiencing a lurch when accelerating from a stop that 3 different mechanics (2 dealers, 1 independent) have not been able to diagnose. It feels like the acceleration is a bit sluggish when the lurch happens but then feels normal at higher speeds. I have not had a check engine light or any other light appear for this issue. No other indicators have appeared about this issue. A check engine light came on for the TCV and was repaired at the dealer - no issue with TCV since.

Do you have any ideas on what could be causing this to happen?

I have tried: 1) a CVT fluid flush which worked for 3 or so days 2) a CVT drain and refill that worked for about 1 week and 3) a fuel injector additive at the suggestion of a coworker - that worked for about 3 months.

If the car is warmed up (temp light turns off) the lurch is not as bad as being cold. If the car is warmed up for 15-20 minutes it's significantly less noticeable but still happens.

Explained below...,"For months, when I turn on my Mazda 3 2005 (automatic 193k miles) car I leave it heating for a bit (5 to 10 minutes) and then I put it in reverse and put down the brake. Then when I put it on drive it goes to 2k revolutions and goes back to 1k. 

However, around two weeks ago it went to 4k and the AT light stayed on. To make it go I had to turn the car off. Then I turned it back on just fine and the AT light was off. It happened maybe 3 days in a row and then it didn't happen again.

Also, around one week ago and yesterday when stopping on the red traffic light signs and then press gas the car would kinda hesitate a little bit and the dashboard lights would go on and off for a few seconds.

I feel that when turning the car on first time of the day, if I leave it heating enough it would behave better. I feel the colder it is, the bigger the chances it gives these issues. And that's also in terms of weather. On winter (30s to 50s F) these issues are stronger. 

Forgot to mention Ive been with my engine light on for two years. I did a tune up and the light came right back on after a few minutes when I did it two years ago and it's been like that ever since. It always reads misfires.

I took the car to the mechanic a week ago, bc I got worried of the AT light, but bc it wasn't on at the moment he wasn't able to read the code for the AT.

Also, my AC doesn't blow cold air, just warm (not sure if hot). Not sure if that might give a clue. I know it's not the refrigerant bc I did an evac and recharge.

The car is always kind of shaky.

If metal or liquid bridged the exposed jumper cables it could cause problems. I think that‚Äôs the main risk - having your hood open just attracts attention and people. 

Is this for a party or something?

WuTangLAN93 (Score: 1): If the engine is idling, the alternator is producing power to run the electronics (radio/speakers, lights, interior blower fan, etc.). The battery is only intended to be used to *start* the engine.

If you are leaving the engine off, but using the radio (key in accessory mode), you would need to supply extra power to keep the car battery voltage from dropping too far to be able to start the engine.

Say you used your jump box to supply the extra power.

Online sources say the jump box holds 20,000 mAh (milli-amp hours).

If you have a stock sound system in your car, it likely draws about 5,000 mAh at max volume.

The rest of the car electronics draw about 30 amps.

20,000 mAh - 5,000 mAh = 15,000 mAh

15,000 mAh = 15Ah

15Ah / 30A = 0.5 hours

Your jump box would die after 30 minutes (likely less due to energy wasted from heat and other inefficiencies).

After that you would be draining your car battery, which holds roughly 50Ah.

50Ah / 35A = about 1.43 hours = 85 minutes

So the estimated total amount of time until both the jump box and car battery are dead is about 1hr 55min (but likely less due to inefficiencies).

This isn't dangerous, but if you're playing music for a party the better option would be to just buy the biggest (plug into the wall) speaker you can afford along with an extension cord.

If you're playing music at a remote location, you'd either want to leave the car idling (bring a couple extra gas cans) or make sure you have a set of jumper cables & another vehicle on site."

I don't know really anything about cars, so i don't know what could be wrong with it, but these are the issues i've noticed since its inspection in August (i don't understand how it passed.)
‚Ä¢ When accelerating between 2nd and 3rd gear(?) there is a hissing noise coming from the front of the car, and sometimes the middle of the car begins vibrating and makes a boat horn like sound.
‚Ä¢ before at 65mph or more, my wheel begins vibrating rather violently, sometimes it slowly stops, sometimes it just continues. This issue persists even after new tires, alignment, etc. but now, the wheel shakes at speeds of 25mph or more.
‚Ä¢ Just last week, I had my oil changed/refilled and got a plug and gasket replaced. I checked my oil today due to the wheel shaking now at 25mph+ and I have no oil on the dipstick. There is no evidence of a leak, so I'm worried the oil is heading into the engine. (This could also be why my wheel is now shaking at lower speeds, I understand that much.)
To top it all off, my check engine light came on a few days ago. I thought it was a wire misfire or whatever (because that frequently happens.) but the check engine persists.

* Is this level of rust considered normal or harmless, or could it become a problem over time?
* What‚Äôs the safest way to clean or de-rust these parts¬†**without removing them or painting**¬†over?

1oe2hhs,Should This Have Passed Inspection [PA],"I know what I think, but I've been out of the field for a number of years, and when I was working in a shop, it was in a non-inspection state out of the rust belt.

Backstory: My folks moved from California to PA about 12 years ago, so the car has been in the rust belt for that long. It's been a second vehicle, and rarely driven since 2016, though.

The car is a 2008 Dodge Caliber SXT 2.0, FWD. My wife was using it, and it threw a CEL, and they got a little pissy about it, so I brought it to my house and hooked up my scan tool, and it had an evap leak, so not a big deal. Also not relevant to the question. 

When I had driven the car previously, the car felt a little loose in corners, primarily in the rear. I know these shitboxes can have rear subframe rust issues, so while I had it here, and had to access the vent line to smoke test it, i wanted to take a look at the subframe. I've included pictures.

Since the car only has ~60k miles on it, the emissions inspection gets exempted due to low annual miles. I sort of figured it had been close to a year since the last inspection. Nope, the inspection was in August. 

I'm sure the consensus will be to scrap the car, but my parents bought it when Chrysler was doing the lifetime power train warranty, and they won't get rid of it (maybe I should cross post this to BoomersBeingFools, lol). It's always been serviced/inspected at the dealership, they won't even let me change the damn oil, the dealer does it 'to maintain the warranty' (yes, I've explained to them that they don't have to do that to maintain the warranty, just keep the receipts.), but I've attest convinced to let me down non power train work.

I'm probably going to get the ok to replace the subframe and related parts when spring gets here, since I'm trying to get another vehicle up and running before winter.",1,1761224023.0,16,AskMechanics,1761334526,2025-10-23 12:53:43,2025-10-24 19:35:26,"Gunny-Guy (Score: 7): Looks solid to me (Northe east England).

Changing the differential oil on the service schedule on my car.

I am not changing the differential itself or components in there, just a differential oil swap.

  
My question is: Is there any ""break in"" period of the fluid change? I see that if you change the differential itself, you should only take short trips for a long time since the oil may run hotter when its new, then you change it a 2nd time to rid yourself of metal fractions in the fluid etc.

  
Does and ""break in"" period apply at all when you just change the oil on a 100k KM 60k Miles car? Will my diff oil still run a bit hotter and require me to take mostly short trips after the change?

I bought it almost 3 years ago, so 20,000 of those miles have been mine over 3 years.  It has always shifted kind of roughly. Long story short,  we ended up having to get a new transmission. While the car was at the dealership they found that the fuel injection sensor also needed to be replaced. After 4 long weeks, I just got my car back yesterday.  I hadn‚Äôt even had it for 24 hours before I ended up broken down on the side of the road. The car tech came and and said he didn't attach the fuel line (or something like that) correctly, so the pressure built up and blew the line while I was driving today. This caused the entire cab to be flooded with the smell of gasoline and the car wouldn't start. The car works now, but I still can't get the smell out and it's making me sick.
 
But, my main question, is does my van sound normal? Before I brought it to the dealership 4 weeks ago,  it was so quiet when starting it up and while driving. Since I got it back yesterday,  its loud. Like it wants to be a sports car, but it's my mom car.

OS420B (Score: 2): So the rust is probably bigger than what you've pointed out, the green area is just what's immediately visible and crunchy. This will fail any inspections

Depending upon the country, if it's been seen during an inspection you might need someone who is a licensed ""frame worker"" to repair it as it is structural. But realistically anyone who is a good welder should be able to do the work.

The work would mean removal of the interior (or rather anything bolted to the floor right above). Cutting out around the green lines, inspecting and cutting out any further afflicted area, creating a patch and fishplate, cleaning it all, welding, cleaning, painting, undercoating.

I don't know about the car, nor am I a body worker, which you probably should try to ask instead of mechanics, but I'd guestimate a day to remove the interior, a day to cut & fabricate & weld and a final day to install the interior and paint. So take your local rates times about 10~22 hours (‚Ç¨80~‚Ç¨300) + material (‚Ç¨100-‚Ç¨200). Though I might be way off as Im not a body guy and would only do that kind of work on my own stuff.

Example: one of their live draws has 20,000 total tickets and a 2,000-per-person limit at ¬£4.99 a ticket That‚Äôs roughly a 10% chance of winning if you maxed out your allowance per person. Some smaller draws have 5,000 tickets, so the odds could be closer to 40%.

They also run 100+ live competitions at once and - Here‚Äôs the important bit-  allow a free postal entry route on equal terms with paid tickets. In theory, if someone entered the maximum number of times by post across all those draws, it seems statistically very likely they‚Äôd win something eventually.

Most of the time it's not a huge issue as the brands were around long enough that a parts supply chain had developed to look after the cars way after the brands had gone, and also because the cars often share components with other brands which still exist here. It's still possible to buy almost anything you need for a 2003 Rover 75 for example.

Fisker was quite an extreme scenario where it was a company only a few years old (in its current form) and only made one car which shared pretty much nothing with any other car. Meaning current owners really are in trouble should any major mechanical or technical failures arise. Although there is now a dedicated community trying their best to look after the cars.

The closest example I can think of would be DeLorean, which managed 2 years of producing 1 model before going belly up, but at least they had the benefit of a significant parts stockpile, lots of which still lasts to this day, shared mechanical components with other brands and wasn't hostage to software bugs which could brick the car entirely.

I think some of the new Chinese brands will leave once others are fully established. Skywell for example, who currently offer a fairly terrible SUV, seem to sell around 7 of them a year here. Even for a huge conglomerate who can take the financial hit, it won't be sustainable. GWM also seem to be going through a bit of a crisis, they've re-branded themselves 3 times or so in the past 2 years and nothing seems to stick.

1oehl7e,Car damaged on ferry - should I get it checked out fully?,"Hi there,

My car (bmw x1, 2019) was damaged by another vehicle (Land Rover defender) rolling into mine on a very rough crossing (6m) through the bay of biscay.

The towbar has snapped part of my lower grille. In my very rookie opinion it looks entirely cosmetic, and I drove for 150 miles after the ferry with no issue.

Ferry company were pretty good with taking an incident report, they‚Äôve said it will be their insurance that covers it rather than the other driver (even though their handbrake probably wasn‚Äôt on fully, cause the vast majority of other vehicles were ok)

So question - should I get the garage I take it to do a proper once over of the front of the car and check other bits aren‚Äôt damaged? Or is it likely to just be a simple grille swap?

You could look at a private sale which would achieve a higher sale price for you, but it would mean you'd likely have to settle the finance first, as most private buyers aren't going to buy a car which is still showing as on finance. Most people for this reason sell their car/trade their car in to a dealer.

If the value of your car is less than your settlement figure, the dealer will pay the finance off on your behalf and any remaining funds will be paid to you, or you can use the money as a deposit on a new car.

I‚Äôm on the hunt for a used car in the ¬£6‚Äì8k range (could stretch to ¬£10k, but would rather not). It must be automatic.

Current car: 2012 Vauxhall Meriva (petrol, manual).
I mostly drive for work within the Glasgow area ‚Äî about 100 miles a week, with around 10 short stops a day (5‚Äì10 minutes between them). I get a 45p/mile allowance from work, and my Meriva is only doing around 32 mpg in city traffic (ouchüôâ).

Outside of that, I do the occasional trip to the Highlands (up to 2 hours one way), and maybe one long trip to London or similar each year.

I‚Äôd like something as new as possible (ideally 2018 or newer), with good fuel economy and decent comfort (nothing bigger than 17-inch alloys ‚Äî smaller preferred). I‚Äôve got a family with one child.

Ideally I‚Äôd like a hybrid, but they tend to be pricey and a lot seem to be ex-Uber/taxi ‚Äî not always easy to tell.

I‚Äôve also thought about going electric (something like a Kona EV), but I live in a flat. There‚Äôs a fast charger nearby, though it‚Äôs 65p/kWh, so not sure if that‚Äôs worth it.

Wanting an automatic is also tricky, since prices for them are higher (only 10% of older cars are automatic, but 25% of new drivers have auto-only licences, so demand exceeds supply).

Forget an EV if you can't charge from home or work. They're absolutely perfect if you can use domestic electricity rates, but the public charging infrastructure is insufficient and expensive. 65p/kWh works out at almost 20p per mile in fuel costs, and there's plenty of normal non-EV cars that can do it for 10p/miles or less.

1oe7mls,UK insurance market is a joke for anyone young lol,"
Simply put, an insurer‚Äôs responsibility is to provide cover for any accidents, and yet, I guarantee that for the very vast majority of young people who get into accidents (at least those with half decent knowledge on this matter, and/or not coming from some rich family who hardly has concern for money), their first thoughts regarding their insurance are ‚ÄúFuck, well there goes my pay checks after renewal. Hopefully I can get this fixed privately because FUCK making a claim!‚Äù

If it‚Äôs pushed people to that mindset (which I‚Äôm confidently assuming it likely has) of absolutely dreading, loathing and last resorting filing a claim; it‚Äôs quite clear there‚Äôs something wrong. 

What even is the point of insurance, from a young driver‚Äôs POV, if that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs come to? Aside from coverage, yes I‚Äôm aware they may serve other purposes. But their MAIN purpose IS coverage; and yes, whilst they are still fulfilling their job of providing coverage, they do it in a way that just makes it extremely unpleasant. It more or less makes insurance feel more like ‚Äúhere, pay us because you don‚Äôt want to be caught driving  without insurance‚Äù rather than ‚Äúhere, pay us so you can count on us when in an incident, and we can provide you with coverage‚Äù

The worst part is I doubt there‚Äôs much that can actually be done. Based on my [admittedly limited] knowledge, because insurance is mandated by the government, combined with high start up costs and limited suppliers (well, limited suppliers for reasonably priced, affordable coverage for young drivers, I should clarify), it unfortunately seems there‚Äôll likely be 0 improvement over the next few years

I‚Äôm aware there is no ‚Äúperfect scenario‚Äù where all of this can be fixed (by either say, insurers themselves, or the government, or the FCA; whoever is meant to intervene) and most of it comes down to a shit market with shit price influencing factors. But at the end of the day; the outcome is unfortunate; insurance companies for young UK drivers are slowly just becoming big groups of bellends who no one wants to deal with in the event of an incident; despite that being their sole, top priority purpose.

The insurers are well aware that most of the time, a younger driver would probably rather sort their car out on their own as if they write it off, it'll cost them less than the yearly premium to replace in most cases. 

What you're paying the massive amount for is the repairs or replacement when you write off someone else's car. The average value of a new car in the UK is now ¬£39k, apparently the average used car is now ¬£16k. Plus repair costs are rising and cars become more complicated and difficult to replace. 

And obviously that doesn't factor in the cost of courtesy cars for the third party and any other damages.

People seem to think if they have an old banger that's worthless they should have cheap insurance. Majority of insurance costs is based on the risk that you have a claim for a lot of money. Say your 20 year old Toyota runs into a Ferrari, suddenly the claim is going to be thousands of pounds, regardless of the value of your car. And statistically young people are more likely to result in a high value claim."

Brake disks and pads seem reasonable

The brake hose price is horrific. For one they're quoting 'genuine' hoses then providing febi and delphi parts numbers. Nothing wrong with these, but not 'Genuine'. Those EXACT front hoses can be had for ¬£21 each on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B006DHURR0) so the pair come in at ¬£42 inc VAT rather than the ¬£112 they quote. Obviously they will mark up the price but this is over 100%.

The delphi rear hoses are a bit more reasonable but still quite marked up, ¬£16.66/each at GSF, though they have a promo where 2 will be ¬£25 inc vat - so again 50% less than they've quoted. They are also very correct about the metal brake pipes - there's a hardline between the caliper and flex hose where the unions almost always corrode onto the line and will twist and snap when removed. They can be bought [here] (https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/175474696337) or the part numbers for L+R passed on.

The rest are advisories. Jetta headlights are the same as Golf and are cheap to buy secondhand or new, or you can try restore or re lens if you're feeling DIY. As this is advisory you can defer this one.

¬£144 for a mid range tyre is very steep. Knowing the common tyre sizes I would guess 225/45/17 which you can get a fully fitted PS5 on Black circles for less! So as this is advisory I would leave it.

when pressed on the issue they graciously took the entire price off the invoice however then stated that the interior coating was not applied as hey were unable to get the supplies to do so.

1oe0b47,From iPhone to full-featured dashcam ‚Äì insights from AutoCam development,"Hey everyone üëã

I‚Äôm one of the developers behind [**AutoCam ‚Äì Dashcam for Vehicle**](https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/autocam-dashcam-for-vehicle/id6753942571?l=tr&utm_source=chatgpt.com), and I wanted to share some real-world usage insights from testing it on iPhone.

**‚ú® Key Features:**

* **4K recording support** ‚Äì captures high-resolution video, great for details on the road.
* **Adjustable FPS** ‚Äì you can choose higher frame rates for smooth recording or lower to save storage.
* **Loop recording** ‚Äì older footage is automatically overwritten once storage is full.
* **Event detection** ‚Äì detects collisions, sudden stops, or sharp turns, automatically locking those clips.
* **GPS overlay** ‚Äì speed, route, and coordinates appear directly on the video.
* **Dual camera support** ‚Äì records front and rear simultaneously (on compatible devices).
* **Custom layouts** ‚Äì you can adjust video and event display formats for better monitoring.
* **Offline and multilingual** ‚Äì works without internet and supports Turkish and other languages.

**My real-world impressions:**

* Battery usage is lower than expected, even with 4K and GPS active.
* Layout customization makes it easy to follow events and recorded clips.
* High FPS + stabilization gives smooth, clear video footage, useful for both safety and documenting trips.

**Who it‚Äôs for:**

* Drivers who want dashcam functionality without extra hardware.
* Ride-share or delivery drivers who need event tracking.
* Anyone wanting detailed road logs or high-res recording of trips.

I‚Äôd love to hear what setups you currently use for dashcam recording ‚Äì dedicated devices or just mobile apps?

Red flags:

* Reviews of the company show a fair number of people giving 1 star reviews saying their purchases broke down, and the company ignored them
* The car is documented as ""sold as seen, no warranty or guarantee""
* The car is ¬£4,000-¬£5,000 cheaper than the next competitor (for a ¬£12,000 car)
* The company will only sell to trade (I have a limited company, so that's fine)

Any one of those would usually put me off - but here I am. So, they've said a full inspection is fine, has anyone used the likes of AA or RAC to do a vehicle inspection?

I've researched the common faults and things to inspect myself, but I think a professional inspection is worthwhile. A visual inspection shows it in good condition and there is not a single advisory in the MOT history, alongside full dealer service history.

A35 is the bottom of this list for speed but it‚Äôs saving grace is the interior and looks pretty smart not the biggest fan of Mercedes but not too bad for what you get money wise.

Basically I want to scrap my car and its insured until the 11/11 I need to get it to 11/11 because then I get my 2nd year NCD and I'm a newish driver. My car is only MOT'd until 30/10 and I'm worried that when the MOT expires it will get clamped as its on a public road.

EDIT - You DO need MOT to park a vehicle on a public road [https://www.gov.uk/getting-an-mot](https://www.gov.uk/getting-an-mot) for anyone who might not have known this. 

I have contacted my insurer (AA) using their online chat services and basically asked if I can scrap the car early and still receive my 2 years NCD - providing I give them a certificate of destruction of my old car and the fact that I've reinsured my new car with them again and I intend to continue to use them. Additionally, its literally 12 days early from the end of my insurance date that I'd scrap the car?? I've paid them ¬£1,300 for the year!! + another ¬£1200 for this year.

Anyway, the guy on the chat was an arse and just kept repeating no without really giving a valid answer. What are my options? I think the whole private land and declaring it SORN is inherently classist as its basically 'those with enough money for private land can work around these issues at no extra cost'.

I have emailed the AA customer services directly and asked for an exemption in this circumstance.

If left with no other option I'm thinking about just paying parking at a cheap car park as that will count as private land?? But it could still cost me ¬£30(ish) which just feels like a waste of money until the day of scrapping.

Ok-Medium-4128 (Score: 7): You'll need a source of clean water. If you don't have a hose and connection to a tap then I'd suggest at minimum 2 buckets. You'll also need either a sponge, washing mitt or a brush. Make sure they're designed for washing cars. You'll also need some car shampoo. Fill one of your buckets with Luke warm water and the specified dosage of shampoo. Fill the other with just plain water. The first thing to do is soak the car with clean water. This is to help remove loose dirt. Next, wash each exterior panel with the shampoo using the mitt, brush or sponge. I'd recommend starting at the roof and working your way down. If you're using buckets then I would also recommend rinsing the soap off after shampooing each panel. Make sure you remove all the shampoo or you'll end up with streaks. Don't forget to wash the glass either and finish with the wheels. To avoid water spots, use a towel to dry the worst of the water off the car. That's the basics. There are loads of extra steps for getting really detailed but for normal everyday life, this should cover most of it. Hope this helps"

RustyU (Score: 1): My first automatic was (and still is) a Seat Leon with a DSG.

Littlelindsey (Score: 1): I had a Golf 2L TDI for about 15 years. Absolutely loved it & would still have it if it wasn‚Äôt for the ulez charge. I‚Äôm a bit biased and primarily drive either a Golf or Audi A3. Usually 1.8-2L as that‚Äôs what we got as company cars. Both a bit pricey so depending on your age & driving experience you might find insurance is a bit steep. I‚Äôm not sure if this your first ever car or if you‚Äôve been driving manuals for years & swapping to automatic.   Unless you‚Äôre doing really high mileage you‚Äôre probably better off with petrol or possibly hybrid.   You also probably don‚Äôt need a 2l engine. I was a sales rep so we always got ‚Äòsales reps cars‚Äô. If you‚Äôre buying a used car check with the timing belt was changed & also it‚Äôs worth checking the car‚Äôs MOT history.    Beware of online scams and don‚Äôt put down a deposit on a car you saw on Facebook or anything like that.    


Others have suggested cars taxi drivers use and I would concur with that. Same with the SEAT, it‚Äôs got the same engine & gear box as the golf. 

I try to buy with the lowest mileage possible within my price range as I don‚Äôt want to get a car that‚Äôs as the stage where bits start falling off. If you have the facilities to fix it yourself you have a bit more wiggle room. Maybe have a look around and see what you can find then post on here and people can give you more specific advice on whether or not to purchase."
1odqqv7,Upgrading headlight bulbs,"Hi, quick question - I have an older 2009 car which uses H4 bulbs for the side lights / head lights.


With it becoming darker, I've started to realise how ineffective the basic halogen bulbs are.  They don't really light up much in front of the car (might be because they're from one of those cheap spare bulb kits you used to be able to pickup from discount stores). 


I'm planning to get some new bulbs and have come across a few options:


- Upgraded halogen bulbs (e.g., H4 OSRAM Night Breaker Silver Bulbs) 


- LED conversion kits (e.g., NIGHTEYE 50W H4 LED Headlight Bulb Light Hi/Lo Beam Kit 6500K HID Super White) 

- Xenon bulbs kits 

As mentioned, it's an older basic spec car without any fancy tech (doesn't even have central locking) so I don't think there'll be any warning messages caused by using the LED / Xenon conversion kits. 


All of them are priced similarly but I'm not really sure what the best option is.

Osram nightbreakers are the way.

SlackHacky (Score: 7): You may find that the actual headlight itself is the problem ( lens gone cloudy ) if a normal reflector type, but if the outer lens is good AND a projector head light (  small lens and housing that holds bulb ) these go cloudy internally and the only logical ( expense and time ) is replace the headlight, I fitted night breakers and they fully killed a bad projector lens in about 3 months.
