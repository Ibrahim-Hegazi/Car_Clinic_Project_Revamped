1os3ukh,Heavy intermittent shaking in front left wheel,"(2001 toyota camry v6) I noticed this problem just today, my dad noticed it yesterday. I've owned this car for almost a year now and now's the only time i've noticed it. 

The wheel typically starts shaking after ~60s at highway speeds causing the car to slightly pull left, and shaking will stop/start or vary in intensity while keeping a continuous pace. Once the shaking starts, slowing down WILL NOT make it stop; only after coming to a full stop or waiting for a few minutes while driving it will go away.   While the wheel is shaking, braking becomes unstable especially downhill at low speeds (feels like wheel is shaped like an oval).

- Shaking usually eases up while i'm turning the wheel at more than ~20 degrees, and after straightening out takes several seconds to start shaking again.
- CV axle boot closer to wheel is severed, but zero clunks or clicking while turning. 
- Shaking has started <24hrs ago and only gets worse the more I drive.

I can't get a video of the wheel shaking, but it can start shaking so hard on the highway that the entire car visibly shakes. Earlier in the day, car would stay straight during the worst of the vibrations if I took my hands off the wheel, but now has a slight left pull (left wheel affected). It honestly feels like my left wheel is being dribbled like a basketball.

I'm aware that the CV boot/axle is almost surely causing the problem, however the suspension doesn't click when turning and the shaking isn't constant at any speed. I want to know if this is normal or abnormal for a failed CV joint.

Replace fluid in master cylinder reservoir, have someone pump the brake peddle while you loosen the bleeder at each wheel until new fluid comes out. YOu want your helper to hold the brake peddle down while you open the bleeder and not release it until you have the bleeder tightened. So- hold brake peddle, loosen bleeder till fluid comes out, tighten bleeder, release peddle, pump peddle a few times and hold. Repeat this process until you get fresh fluid at each wheel. I like to use the one man bleeder kit they have at the part store- has a vinyl tube and a magnetic plastic bottle. Just attach the hose to the bleeder and crack it open, put the bottle where you can see it under the car, stand on your knees and pump the brake peddle with your hand while you look under the car at the bottle. Toyota doesn't specify an order but generally you want to start with the wheel furthest away from the master and work your way to the closest wheel."

It used to be that these came gapped, I just stopped checking but recently someone on reddit said they gap them. I bought a wire gauge and well all my brand new ones were about 0.41 when they need to be 0.44 so I gapped them. 

You likely did chip the iridium even if you can't see it(maybe use a loupe to check). If you put any kind of force on them it's all it takes. it's pretty fragile but the material holds up to the heat, compression, etc in a cylinder really well.

i drive a 2014 nissan maxima, and i’m about a 12 hour/700 mile drive away from home and my wonderful DIY-dad who helps me out with my car right now. i don’t drive back home for another 2 months, and currently drive about a combined 10 miles to and from work daily. about 3 weeks ago, i was getting a routine oil change when i was quoted over $2000 in damage - a leaking power steering hose and an oil-leaking valve cover gasket. i declined the repairs and got a second opinion on the power steering - which i was told was okay to top off the fluid until i got home to get a cost effective repair. when the second-opinion mechanic was working on my power steering, he didn’t mention any leaking oil (i didn’t mention it to him either to avoid any possible upsell). i haven’t noticed anything either - no burning oil smell, no strange noises (beyond that of a car that’s 11 years old), and no significant puddles under the car that evoke any worry. i’ve googled nonstop and have made myself sick with worry - with it being so close to when i make the trek home & plans to get a new car, i’m trying to avoid any damage that would eat into the funds i have saved for a new car. 

basically, what im asking is this: will i be okay? (loaded question, but in this specific context, if i drive sparingly until that large trek home, am i alright?) ",2,1762638114.0,10,MechanicAdvice,1762716714,2025-11-08 21:41:54,2025-11-09 19:31:54,"TheYoungProdigy (Score: 1): Check your oil

About a week and a half ago I ran into the gas station for about five minutes. When I turned my car back on I suddenly heard this nose. The best way to describe it is that it sounded like I was stepping on my gas pedal while I was idling but the RPM gage stayed normal. I went straight home and decided to check my oil. It was very low. I brought it to my local garage the next day.

 Even though I've always liked them and have been a loyal customer with them for years I'm starting to think they are dropping the ball.  I told them about the sound and told them that my oil was very low but it was like all they heard was me say the oil was low. From what I can tell it seems like all they did was put new oil in it and flat out forgot to deal with the noise.

I had a feeling if my shut my engine off it wasn't going to start again. Sure enough. I ended up call AAA. And by the time the driver eventually came the car started up again with no problems. But the noise was still there. I asked the driver what he thought the problem was and he said it was a belt. Since my car was working at that moment the AAA driver escorted me home.

 I took my car back to my local garage again the next day, told them what happened and they started working on it. Turns out the problem was the alternator was wearing down and it was affecting the battery. (Those guys have always been super nice but it definitely annoys me that didn't realize that the first time I brought it to them) I had to get a new alternator. I Thought everything was fine again, it was driving fine but when I slowed down or was idling at a stop sign or stop light the engine started to loudly rattle. (Ii would rattle a little bit for a few seconds prior to all of this but nothing like what it was doing) But the next day (yesterday) everything was 100% fine again. I drove it around the neighborhood and everything Seemed great.

Now my Current problem. When I put the key in the ignition and turn it both the battery light and oil light come on. But when I turn the engine over both those lights go away and it Seems like everything is fine again.  

My local guy did say that my battery was kind of old (four years) so I guess I'm not too surprised the battery light went on. But why is my oil light going on when it was just changed??

""When I put the key in the ignition and turn it both the battery light and oil light come on. But when I turn the engine over both those lights go away""

That's normal. All cars do that. (When the engine isn't turning, the alternator isn't turning to charge the battery, so the red ""battery"" light comes on, plus the oil pump isn't turning, so there's no oil pressure, so the oil pressure warning light comes on. And that's how you know those warning lights are working.) It's if the ""battery"" light or oil pressure warning light come on \*while the engine is running\* that you know you have a problem, and should pull over and stop the engine (and do that very quickly if it's the oil light, or you can get major engine damage)."

I took the battery out and put it on a charger to top it up and  cleaned a few of the grounds. I also checked the large connectors in the engine bay for corrosion including the ect sensors.

The ect sensors themselves seem to respond to temperature change correctly.

After putting everything back together and test driving it there are no longer any codes but I still have a charging system problem error even though the alternator is putting out over 14v

I also found that the radiator cooling fans never seem to come in.  I got the engine up to 218f and they wouldn't turn on

I did find that I can put the truck in acc mode with the AC and blower fan on but with the fan relay out.  If I test the fuse box socket for the sub fan, across the coil pins there is 12v, so the ECU is commanding the fan on.

You can prob do it all for about $450 in fluids and maybe another $50 in rags, drain pans, etc if you don’t already have all that.

You can get most of the fluids you’ll need at WalMart. Only caveat I’d add is to use OEM transmission fluid. Name brand fluids are fine for everything else, but transmissions can be finicky with fluids so going with OEM removes one possible headache at minimal additional expense. Transmission is also the most touchy with fluid levels so either measure out exactly what you remove and replace the exact same amount, or learn how to properly set the fluid levels (which may involve setting the level while the system is hot).

Best to you- you got this!

Edited to add basic DIY estimates for each:

Engine oil and filter:  $60+12  = $72 total

Front diff: $35 in fluid

Rear Diff: $35-55

Transmission: $160

Transfer case: $50?

Radiator: $50 in antifreeze, $15 in distilled water, and $12 in radiator flush liquid if you do a full radiator flush and full fluid exchange. $40-50 if you just do a simple radiator drain and fill

Check to see if your car has wiring extensions for the rear oxygen sensors for aftermarket exhausts. If they do, they might be bad(check for resistance on both ends of each wire with a multimeter). Also check your grounds from battery to chassis and from chassis to engine.

Most common problems are:  
oxygen sensors go bad from old age or corny ass pop tunes  
the car is sitting too low and the wires get damaged from road debris  
ground cables from chassis to engine break from old age  
cheap aftermarket wire extensions start building resistance

If wiring checks out, you might have a problem with the engine computer.

1ort74x,My infotainment screen isn't working correctly (my car Kia Stonic 2022),"(I'm not sure about what flair should I use for this post)

So, my almost 3-year-old car has started to present some problems with its screen (infotainment). At first, there were some weird apps opening without me tapping the screen (ghost touches). Now it's gotten worse; it's happening more and more, and also not responding when I touch it sometimes.

My brother has the same car as me since he liked it and it wasn't that pricey here in Spain. I checked his, and it's working perfectly, so I know it's not my phone/Android Auto. I also have an iPhone and have discarded CarPlay issues. It's the screen itself.

I'll go to the dealership and Kia service to ask them to fix it since I'm still covered by warranty.

My question is if anyone here has suffered something similar and if they got it solved or not even with a different car, not necessarily KIA.

Because next year in December, I can decide to return the car or keep it, and to be honest, if my car is having a faulty infotainment system and changing the screen won't solve the issue and it will appear again in 2 or 3 years, I won't keep the car because I can't even listen to the radio if the screen starts touching the stop button, and it's also useless if I'm traveling to some place and my map keeps closing.

The alternator numerous times). I am still learning cars and working towards possible being a mechanic one day so I do everything myself. Anyways. After this happened for about 2 weeks it started dying while I was driving. The Rpm’s would drop and the engine would die and I would just have to coast. If I got lucky the car would start back up before I had to pull over kicking back on by itself. When the car dies I have to put it in park turn the car off and then restart the engine and this normally works for me it has just got infuriating to me and probably all the other drivers I hold up at stop lights when my car dies.

Here’s where my knowledge ends and I need help. The first thing I tried was running sea foam through the engine and that seemed to work great for about 3 days. Then I tried cleaning the throttle body becuse I thought it was sticking and when I took it off it seemed super dirty.

I have had a cat converter bank 1 below threshold code pop up since I bought the car basically. However I never thought anything of it becuse the car ran fine.

About a week and a half ago I ran into the gas station for about five minutes. When I turned my car back on I suddenly heard this nose. The best way to describe it is that it sounded like I was stepping on my gas pedal while I was idling but the RPM gage stayed normal. I went straight home and decided to check my oil. It was very low. I brought it to my local garage the next day.

 Even though I've always liked them and have been a loyal customer with them for years I'm starting to think they are dropping the ball.  I told them about the sound and told them that my oil was very low but it was like all they heard was me say the oil was low. From what I can tell it seems like all they did was put new oil in it and flat out forgot to deal with the noise. 

A few days later I started Door Dashing again (the first time I drove it again) and on my first delivery all of the sudden my car lost its power steering and a few moments later my battery light went on. I had a feeling if my shut my engine off it wasn't going to start again. Sure enough. I ended up call AAA. And by the time the driver eventually came the car started up again with no problems. But the noise was still there. I asked the driver what he thought the problem was and he said it was a belt. Since my car was working at that moment the AAA driver escorted me home.

 I took my car back to my local garage again the next day, told them what happened and they started working on it. Turns out the problem was the alternator was wearing down and it was affecting the battery. (Those guys have always been super nice but it definitely annoys me that didn't realize that the first time I brought it to them) I had to get a new alternator. I Thought everything was fine again, it was driving fine but when I slowed down or was idling at a stop sign or stop light the engine started to loudly rattle. (Ii would rattle a little bit for a few seconds prior to all of this but nothing like what it was doing) But the next day (yesterday) everything was 100% fine again. I drove it around the neighborhood and everything Seemed great.

Now my Current problem. When I put the key in the ignition and turn it both the battery light and oil light come on. But when I turn the engine over both those lights go away and it Seems like everything is fine again.  

My local guy did say that my battery was kind of old (four years) so I guess I'm not too surprised the battery light went on. But why is my oil light going on when it was just changed??

1os4bbv,Help Identify a Leak in my 2012 Subaru Outback 2.5L,"Hey all!

I have an Automatic 2012 Subaru Outback 2.5L with about 160k miles on it which recently started leaking quite a bit clear, odorless liquid from underneath the car, near the front passenger side (see pictures). I cannot figure out what is causing this leak.

There are no warning lights lit up on my dashboard and the car has never been in an accident. I regularly do my oil, filter and fluids. The leak has not affected my fluid levels at all. The leak also occurs consistently regardless of outdoor temp, engine temp or outdoor weather. At first I thought that it may just be condensation from running the a/c or defogger, however the leak persists even with those things off. More than that, I don’t think water would stain the asphalt like I am seeing this leak does. The only thing I have noticed is that while the car is running there is a very strong metallic smell coming from the engine bay which smells like incredibly hot metal. The best way I can explain this is that it smells like a hot cast iron pan which has been cooking in the oven for too long. The smell is strong enough that I can smell it inside the car after driving for a short time. As soon as I turn the car off the smell goes away. 

I am positing pictures of where I believe the leak is occurring, as well as pictures of the asphalt under my car to give an idea of the amount of liquid that has leaked in the past two days. I took this picture while standing on the passenger side of the car looking down thru the engine bay below the cabin air intake near the firewall. There appears to be a wet (or greasy) spot on a part of the engine down there. I am not a certified mechanic, please forgive me for not being able to ID the part of the engine I’m talking about. 😓

Would anyone be able to help me identify what’s going on? Please and thank you!

Is it an automatic transmission? I could see a throw out bearing making that noise, but you would have to have pressure on the clutch for that to be engaged. 

That noise is your serpentine belt. What happens if you hit the gas and raise the rpm to 4,000? I'll bet it stops. 

That noise most often comes from the belt tensioner pulley, but it could be any other belt driven accessory. You said you replaced  belt, but that wouldn't stop a squeaky pulley from making noise. In fact, I've had a belt replacement cause the tensioner pulley to chirp. The pulley may ""feel"" fine to you, but unless you put it on a bench and tested it's tolerance, you can't be sure. 

If you want ton be sure the noise's origin is bell housing, get a scope from [Amazon for >$10,00](https://a.co/d/44QNoxz). My bet is an accessory or pulley, and I'll go even further to say belt tensioner pulley.

So:

Both front endlinks are disconnected (one won’t come off the old strut, the other spins freely).

One front wheel isn’t straight. (Did I fuck up the wheel hub angle)

There’s a ticking and clunking noise when turning. (Clunking could be from the endlinks hanging, not sure bout the ticking tho)

Steering feels loose when going straight and feels heavier, tighter in turns. (Maybe cuz the spring rate?)

Steering wheel doesn’t fully return to center after turning. (Is it because the endlink?)

I took it in for a routine oil change and they found some leakage. So the job became more involved because they had to remove the timing chain on the left side of the engine bay to access the leak and replace the gasket and seal things up again.

Everything seems fine, but as I was driving home, after about 10 mins on the road I started smelling a burning smell. I was near my home at this point, and after I parked, smoke was seeping out of every gap around the hood.

I was slightly concerned so I didn't open the hood right away. What you see here is what was still smoking after maybe a minute. You can see it's in the back of the engine bay.

Do you think some oil simply got on the outside of the block and was burning up once the engine was warmed up or something else? The mechanic said they ran my engine for about an hour after resealing the leak to make sure everything was closed up. I have to imagine they would have 1) noticed smoke; 2) that if it is oil, it all would have burned off during the hour.

I have a BMW e90 IHKA (A/C) panel and I want to get it to turn on, so far Ive connected power and ground but nothing happens even when pressing buttons, I suspect it needs CAN activity so Im sending it ignition messages but its still not having it. My next step is to look at the datasheet of the MCU that the CAN lines are going to and see what it needs to wake up, however I'm just wondering if people have done this before and maybe its something simple.   
  
I am doing this because I want to get my BMW E93 electric seat to activate the seat heating. To do this, I need to figure out what CAN messages to send to the seat, not able to probe a car. The seat is not going to be in a car, its a desk chair.

**The main thing now** is I am trying to get the IHKA (AC panel) to turn on and hopefully when I press the seat heating button then I'll get some messages on the bus which turn the seat heating on and then I can try to replicate it.

I initially tried the seat heating module way with a PWM signal but I cant figure it out and I've asked around if anyone can probe it for me but no luck, if anyone here is able to I'd really appreciate it.

I have savvycan but for some reason if I try to playback a recording there is no activity on the bus (checked with oscilloscope), so I am going to try another CAN board. So either the AC panel sending a message which I can copy, or finding out what the PWM signal is, is my last hope.

So far I have been able to keep the seat module alive using ignition messages.

To be clear, this is all a bench test, no car involved. I want to get the IHKA panel turned on and then I can monitor the bus wires for any messages when pressing the seat heating buttons to then replicate and control the seat as needed.

Pubelication (Score: 1): The datasheet of the MCU will not help you, because there's most likely a proprietary program flashed to that MCU and there is no public information about it.

First, make sure you have common ground. Eg. Arduino, CAN module, AC Panel, seat, all need the same ground.  

Second, you will likely need a 120 ohm resistor on CAN L/H, but you can also try 60, because the AC Panel was a node and likely does not have termination (you'd have to check the circuit). IHKA is on K-CAN so make sure to set 100 Kbit/s.  

Third, try these:

Ignition (every 100ms):  
0x130 -- 0x45, 0x42, 0x69, 0x8F, 0xE2  
byte[0] 0x45 means engine running  
You can try 0x41 for key position 1  
You should not need the whole sequence (off, auxiliary, starting, running)

Ignition status (every 200ms):  
0x26E -- 0x40, 0x7F, 0x7F, 0x00, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF  
First three bytes are status:  
0x00, 0x3F, 0x3F key position 0 (off)  
0x00, 0x7F, 0x7F key position 1  
0x40, 0x7F, 0x7F key position 2  

Lighting (every 200ms)
0x21A -- 0x04, 0x00, 0xF7  
Should cause backlight to come on

You may not need anything else. Post an update if you get something to happen.  
Make your program read all traffic and print it to the serial monitor. The AC unit should send *something* periodically. This will also help with finding which message contains the button press later on. You don't really need SavvyCAN for that.  
If nothing happens, start troubleshooting with removing the termination resistor or replacing the 120 ohm resistor with two 120 ohm resistors in parallel (60 ohm)."

I just had a great conversation with Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford Motor Company, which will air Sunday night at 10pm on One Nation. (That’s Kilmeade’s show on Fox.) Jim told me that as of yesterday morning, Ford Service Departments around the country had 6,000 empty bays. Not because people’s cars and trucks didn’t need fixing, but because the shortage of technicians has become that profound. 

Ford isn’t alone. Every single automotive company in America is struggling to hire technicians, and the problem – (in spite of what you’ll likely read in the comments,) has nothing to do with the pay, the benefits, or the working conditions. These jobs offer a clear path to a six-figure career, with little to no college debt. In part, the problem is mathematical - this year, 37,000 new techs were hired across the country.

I ended up putting Motorcraft plugs in and it cleared up.  Is the truck really that picky?  Is there something off about NGK plugs?  Is there anything else I should avoid replacing on this truck with aftermarket parts?  For example, I have an injen cold air intake.  More details below.

My truck hit 100,000 miles and recommended new plugs.  I bought what seemed to be the best plugs, which were NGK iridium something (can't remember the specific type).  They seemed to do a great job.  My gas mileage went up from an average of 13 mpg to an average of 15.5 mpg.  It also seemed to run a lot smoother.  I did notice some tugging at fast starts, but thought the tires were slipping.  One day I punched it up a pretty steep hill.  It started tugging real bad, then the check engine light started flashing at me.  I pulled over and it all cleared up.  But after that it would do the same thing every time I laid on the throttle.  I called a dealer who had worked on it before, and they said Fords can only use Motorcraft plugs and the coil packs should also be changed at tune ups.  I thought it was crazy 1. That you would need to change coil packs every time and 2. That you could only buy Motorcraft parts.  I went ahead and changed the plugs back to Motorcraft.  I also double checked there wasnt a gap issue on the NGKs, and they were fine.  So far it seems to have fixed it.  The odd thing is that my gas mileage went back down and it started riding rough again.  Are these trucks really that picky?  Is there something about NGK that isn't compatible with Ford, and if so, why are they still selling them?  Is there something different about NGKs that would increase gas mileage but cause a misfire?  And finally, should I avoid using aftermarket parts, like the injen cold air intake?

Tl/DR aftermarket plugs caused a misfire and the dealer said I could only use Motorcraft parts.  Is this really the case?

If your replacement NGK plugs had a higher temperature range than the stock Motorcraft plugs they replaced, you may very well end up with some of these symptoms.

There shouldn’t be any reason you can’t use a different brand of spark plug than Motorcraft, but I would bet you the ones you got were hotter than the ones they replaced, or the ones the dealer swapped in afterwards.  Double-check on that before you change them next time and I think you should be okay.

About a year ago my engine light starting coming on anytime I went over 100km per hour. Car would jolt around a little bit and the light would come on, code was always for transmission pressure sensor.

I’ve spent like 3k at a mechanic trying to find the issue but everytime they said it was fixed it came back on.

Then a few months ago my car started making a really loud noise when backing up, took it back to the mechanic and they told me it roadtested fine and they fixed stuff but the noise continued only in reverse 


About 2.5 weeks ago my dashboard started telling me all my tires were low but no matter how much air I added they stayed low, and one was reading as 5x what it should be. 

The next day my car started making this really really loud sound while driving and I thought it was about to blow up or something, pulled over to this garage.

The guys there said they weren’t mechanics but would look it over

They showed me the issue the entire time was a bunch of busted plastic the the front of my car and my tires were making the noise I guess.

They repaired the plastic somehow and now no more noise driving forward or reverse.. and my dashboard went back to normal readings on tires

They also said I was extremely low on coolant and needed to find out why and they had some so they put it in

They wouldn’t charge me any money so I went back with cookies a few days later and I asked if they did anything else because my engine light wasn’t coming back on since

1orriuc,Van suddenly stopped,"2016 Kia Sedona sx 92,000ish miles. 

Sorry for the length. 

Bought this van 4 months ago from a used car lot.

Daughter and I were heading on an overnight trip to see family, she was driving as we were getting driving hours for her and I was mostly focused on her driving and deer. We had made a pit stop and just got back on the road.

The van suddenly stopped accelerating, so we pulled off to the side of the interstate with hazards on. I looked at the dash to see if there were any warning lights, no. I then look at the temperature gauge and it's in the red 🤦.

We didn't turn off the car but popped the hood to find the coolant tank boiling and the cap off from pressure. Went back into the van and turned the heater on full blast, but it only blew cold air.

Called a tow because we're in the middle of nowhere, 1.5 hours from home, and are 2 women in the dark. I know a little about cars but not enough to be able to dx.

Fast forward 40 minutes - waiting for the tow truck - and the temp gauge is still in the red and hadn't come down at all. At some point during that 40 minutes the coolant tank stopped boiling and the level of the fluid was at Full. Interesting since I could tell there was coolant on the surrounding area. 

At the end of the 40 minutes the van suddenly started vibrating, making a different noise (can't explain it) and the heater suddenly started blowing hot air. We then heard/saw that the coolant tank was boiling again. Temp gauge was still in the red (outside temp was about 35F). 

At that point my husband told me to turn it off because it was unlikely to cool down. So we did. 

At one point a good Samaritan stopped to see if we were okay and he looked at the car, tapped the radiator cap to see if it was hot, no. Then since the tow was a couple minutes out he left. I checked the level on the coolant again and it was now at L. I had checked underneath and didn't see any pooling or dripping, but it was also dark

We are towed to the nearest town with a hotel. After we unloaded my dad suggested I turn it to aux, so I did. Temp gauge was now at Cold.

I couldn't get it to lock, unlock with the door button nor could we get the auto doors to open. It was acting like the battery was too low.

My dad, who knows more about cars than me, thinks I either blew a head gasket and/or the computer system is fried. 

What are your thoughts based on this? 

Some other info that may be pertinent:
After we bought the van we took it to the Kia dealer to have them look at the sliding doors (need new motors, common issue with them). During their whatever point inspection, they said they found oil in the coolant tank and suggested a new engine ($12k). After that we took it directly to our normal mechanic who looked it over and didn't find anything wrong with it, no oil. They replaced the cap and refilled the coolant. 

We haven't had an issue with it until now. Are we screwed? Lemon laws don't apply in my state unless it's a brand new vehicle. We bought this used from a used dealership.

Loss of Coolant Without an Actual Problem?","During a 200 mile round trip for work this week I noticed my temp gauge bouncing from low to high but generally below the red zone. It did reach the red zone about 3 times but each time it immediately dipped back to the normal range. The issue started about 60 miles into the trip with my speed being about 70 mph on average. I assumed it was a thermostat problem because the expansion tank indicated full which I assumed was normal, the coolant was bright pink, there were no smells, steam, smoke or unusual noises. The engine did not seem exceptionally hot when I popped the hood, which also felt normal. I have no signs of any coolant leaks in my driveway and I have a home office so the car spends all of its off road time at my house.

The next day I dropped the car off at the dealer where I purchased it and where it gets regular maintenance. Later that day I got a call from the advisor indicating that they had added a gallon of coolant and could not replicate the problem. I told her the coolant level was already full and I found it suspect that the tech had added so much coolant considering the car never actually overheated. I also questioned how they could claim there was no problem. How is losing a gallon of coolant not an indication of a failure?

She bought it at 120,000km and has now 190,000km, without her changing the oil once (!!). Popped the oil filter housing cap loose with a hand ratchet, pulled it out and it’s snapped the other half of the tube in the housing. I guess 70,000km intervals and being plastic can do that.. Being in Australia, no stores physically carry these, and about a 3-5 business day wait. She can’t be without a car during the week (kids). I still went ahead and changed oil and filter (only had about half the oil it was meant to have if you were wondering, very black). Stuck it all back together as is.. my thinking is that it doesn’t really have anywhere to go, and the stem stuck in there likely hasn’t moved, so I couldn’t really see it blocking up anything or losing pressure. Please put my mind at ease that it’s not ‘detrimental’ and she’ll be right.. at the very least til a new replacement can be installed next week? If not next service. Cheers all.

As for your knocking paired with that code, it's almost definitely a low oil pressure situation. The pump probably has the option to be replaced with or without an included strainer, and they're opting to act with an overabundance of caution and replace both while the engine is disassembled, or it's cheaper and easier to just replace the whole assembly at once. If your engine isn't gummed up to hell with sludge, and the oil level is good and it hasn't been run super low in the past, the oil pump will be, in my experience, the most likely culprit.

You’re actually in a stronger financial position now by not rushing into a car. Once your expenses start going up, those monthly payments will add a strain to your budget.

If you really realy really want a car though, I’m not sure about your current choice. Maybe look into a petrol model instead,  something like an Audi A3 or a Mercedes A-Class could be a solid option and okay maintenance-wise.

I’d prefer to have a separate wheelset for my winter wheels as finding people to switch them on an off is a hassle and I’m happy to switch wheels myself.

Is there a smarter and more affordable away to make this change without asking Volvo to do this each time I switch the wheels?

1orq02z,Honda Crossroad - am I insane?,"Hey! Im thinking about getting a Honda crossroad (the ones from around 2010, Japanese import. Not the re badged land rovers that Honda sold in the 90s).

Image is from google - not a specific one that is for sale. 

The specs look great. Reviews always look pretty good. This era of Honda I always think of as very reliable. They either come with the 1.8 or 2.0 litre R18A or R20A vtec that is also in the civics and CRVs of the same era. 

Prices around £5-8k 

BUT. They are rare over here in the UK. So parts might be a problem for repairs? Im thinking windscreens and things like that. Also, knowledge from local garages might be difficult to come by? 

I dunno. Im scared off by the Japanese import part of the story, but they seem to offer much more than similar age CRV or similar vehicles. 

Essentially what I want is a reliable and big enough vehicle for a small family. Used a couple of times a week to commute about 15 miles, and for holidays/weekends hauling stuff around.

I'm aware of the EcoBoom engine but also heard there can be issues with the turbo (rattling) in the Seat engine so both would be costly repairs if they're to go 'bang' so that puts me on the fence.

Aesthetically both cars look great but I lean towards the focus for that. Feature wise both contain what I want. 

I think it's going to come down to running costs & the overall reliability of the car. I'm hoping you guys/gals could maybe give some insight into what each car was like to run daily to help me come to a decision.

Also also add both are priced around £8.4k.

People will screech about the fact that it doesn't have a wet belt, and has a timing chain, and they're right, but it still has a wet belt. While the valvetrain is run by a timing chain, the crank also has a pulley on it that drives a wet belt that powers the oil pump.

It's a common misconception that most EcoBoost engines die from their valvetrains eating themselves due to wetbelt timing failure.

Some of them do, but the more common cause is oil starvation, which occurs when the wet belt breaks down, starts to peel and split, and pieces of it block the oil pickup in the sump, starving the engine of oil, which leads to spun bearings, or other mechanical failures and heat seizing.

This still happens on EcoBoost engines that have a timing chain, but a wet belt driving the oil pump.

There are a few better options if you want to stick mainstream - Motorway are fairly decent for example. 

However, any car dealer should be able to part-ex in your existing car with finance and settle the finance on it as part of the deal. It’s their bread and butter. This gets even easier if the finance for the new vehicle is with the same company as the old (for example my motorbike I just bought is on finance with BMW finance, as was my old bike, so the BMW dealer just sorted it all out. I rode in on one, rode out on the other a few hours later).

If you sell privately then you obviously need to declare it’s got finance outstanding. Have a settlement figure already prior to a buyer coming round to buy the car. 

I’ve done this too - just sit down with the buyer and have them pay the finance element directly and give you any equity payment remaining. If you’re in negative equity then you need to settle the finance then and there after the new buyer has paid their bit. 

New buyer pays finance company directly whilst in front of you, pays you any balance etc, paperwork done, sorted."

1orl227,82% increase risk of death if a child is hit by an SUV,"This is something I read in an article today which stated that a “44% relative increase in the likelihood of death for an adult pedestrian or cyclist hit by a SUV or similarly large car compared with a standard car”

And 

“For children there was an 82% relative increase in the likelihood of death” 

“The taller squarer bonnets of SUVs cause more serious injuries. When an adult pedestrian is hit by a car often they are struck close to the knees before being carried on the car bonnet. If hit by an SUV the pedestrian is more likely to be struck on the pelvis and then flung forward into the road increasing the chance that the SUV rolls over them. For children the point of impact may be their head. Poorer visibility for drivers in large SUVs rather increases risk to children. The average driver in a Land Rover defender cannot see a 4 year old child standing directly in front”

I drive around in a lotus Elise/mx5 and these stats make for a quite chilling read. I do wonder myself sometimes if I should buy a bigger car just for better crash protection.

Buying a car isn’t too complicated and to reference your post tax doesn’t transfer from one owner to another at purchase so you will have to tax it yourself.

Once you find a car you like (it’s hard to recommend a car without knowing your budget or requirements) you can easily sort insurance by finding quotes and following the steps on insurers websites.

Work of caution, try and do the quotes before you buy the car to ensure the car you select isn’t too expensive to insure.

Avoid buying a diesel, you'll ruin the dpf and it'll get clogged up if you're not driving it alot.

A good option for a first car would be a Volkswagen Up! I just bought one :)

Go to used car dealers or use Auto Trader, cinch etc

A car will always be untaxed when you purchase it, it doesn't continue to the next driver so you have to take out new tax for the vehicle when you get given V5 unless the dealership does this for you.

Insurance is easy, just make sure to fill out all information correctly I use compare the market! Don't lie on insurance because if it gets damaged, stolen or crashed it will be voided and it will negatively impact yourself."

1org006,520d BMW 5 Series M Sport v Audi A6 Estate 40 TDI S Line,"Hi folks. I’m torn.

I’m in the market for a new vehicle, and have test driven an Audi A6 and BMW 520D.

The Audi A6 is £18,200 and the BMW is £15,500.
The Audi A6 has 84,000 miles and is 2019, whereas the BMW is 2018 and has 92,000 miles on the clock.

I obviously fell in love with both cars, but particularly the BMW took my heart.

The issue I have is that I am reading everywhere that BMWs have a notoriously high maintenance cost. Additionally, I went for a test drive in the BMW and heard what I thought was ‘clicking’ in the rear cabin, although it sounded more to my Dad of plastic/internal parts rubbing off itself.

If I thought for one moment that it were possible to upkeep without issues for a while, I’d take the BMW. It’s also better in terms of price point for me at the moment.

Any suggestions what I should watch out for?

No, you've cancelled it. The only time this counts is if the insurance company cancels you mid-term. This is usually for fraud or mis-representation reasons, and if they void your policy.   
  
If a company isn't able to offer a renewal quote, that does not count. Not renewing you and cancelling you is very different.

But no, you cancelling your policy yourself is not something you'll need to tell anyone else.

PhysicsAgitated6722 (Score: 3): The only negative to cancelling mid term is you can't count that year in a no claims period as only whole year on 1 policy counts. So for example, if you have 1 policy for 6 months, cancel it, and have another policy for the remaining 6 months of the year, your no claims bonus is zero. You would need to wait until the second policy has gone the full 12 months to count."
