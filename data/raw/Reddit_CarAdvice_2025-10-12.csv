1o4ak8j,"Oil leak, is it worth chasing down?","I recently bought a 2013 Chevy Sonic lt 1.6l, which was leaking slightly from the cam/crank seals and the valve cover gasket. I changed the belt, tensioner, seals and valve cover gasket. 75 kms after the belt change, I pulled the plastic cover and the belt and seals were dry.  The valve cover gasket was done about 30 km ago. Today I took the car out on the highway and drove it for about 45 minutes at speeds of up to 100 km/hr. Put a plate under the pan, which was dry, and got a few drips. So, maybe it is residual oil, or  the oil filter housing gasket, the front timing cover-to-oil pan joint or the pan. These do not have a gsaket, they are sealed with RTV. I know the next step would be a UV dye test. But I only drive the car once a week and I am thinking just monitor it.

Essentially the converter scrubs the exhaust of nitrogen oxygen compounds NOx (x being a variable because there are more than one).  How it does this is by storing them on the catalyst, then unburnt fuel in the exhaust gets burned using the heat and oxidizers stored in the converter.  Complete combustion releases only water and carbon dioxide.

There are multiple failure modes.

Poisoning and mechanical breaking are likely the most common.

100,000 to 150,000 miles is a ""typical"" lifespan but many last longer or fail much sooner.

If your mechanic thought that you had a very small break in said gasket on the coolant side, the stopleak may help but is likely to take awhile. That said, if the head gasket issue is warpage or another failure, the stopleak won't do shit, and at the level at which it's causing a misfire (shaking) it's a bit much for stop leak to help at all. Your mechanic may not have been in the wrong to use the stuff but i feel like he was wrong about the scope of the leak.

Not the injector (5, or any of the others) as I blow the smoke away and it starts again slightly off to the right under the engine mount thing. 

The smoke started instantly from turnover cold after the job so naturally that pointed me away from oil or coolant burning and towards combustion gasses.

Best way to check parasitic draw is with a multi meter on battery and engine off, monitor the drop in voltage, even if it’s .01v drop every minute or so. Note that, then begin remove/replace fuses until you hopefully see the voltage drop stop. The fuse that stops it would indicate the circuit the parasitic draw is on. If nothing in the fuse box stops the drop, disconnect the alternator and check, then the starter next. 
Alternators can go bad and discharge your battery when not running. It’s not common these days but shouldn’t be overlooked. Sometimes I start there sometimes I start at fuse box, sometimes i isolate the battery from everything and see if the battery itself is discharging."

Thanks in advance for taking the time to read this, I really appreciate it.

My husband was driving our 2019 Dodge Challenger SXT (3.6L V6) when the front passenger wheel suddenly folded outward at low speed. There were no warning lights, noises, or impacts before it happened. The lug nuts were still on tight afterward, the wheel didn’t come off, but it was pushed out at an angle like the suspension or control arm gave way.

The car had passed a New York State inspection a month or two ago and was recently serviced.

We’re just trying to understand what exactly broke and whether it could have been a critical suspension failure (ball joint, control arm, knuckle, etc.).

I will post a few photos from the scene showing the damage from different angles. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/TbxnZBq)

Questions:

Based on what you can see, what part looks like it failed?

Would welding or patching that component be unsafe (we’d rather replace the whole part if needed)?

Is there anything specific we should ask the repair shop to document for our records or insurance?

Any insight would really help. we’re just grateful everyone’s okay and want to make sure the car is repaired safely and correctly.

With the special production of only 1,500, he might be spot on with this. But that's not for the Mark VIII itself. That would refer to the conversion the car clearly has for the vinyl ""landau"" top. It was a styling fad in the 1970's, and the only newer cars with them are all conversions by old people who don't know any better. They think it's desirable. It's not. Styling has moved on since 1976. Lincoln made tens of thousands of Mark VIII's. It was one of their more popular models behind the Town Car and the Continental.

Now as to the super special engine, it both is and isn't special. It's a 4.6L DOHC Ford Modular V8 with 32 valves (4 per cylinder) making \~300 HP. It's almost the same exact engine used by the Ford Mustang SVT Cobra of the day. The difference is that Lincoln used a Teksid block, which was cast in Italy and then sent to America for final assembly. The Teksid blocks are often sought after for racing because it's believed they're stronger than the normal 4 valve aluminum blocks. But aside from the possibly stronger engine block, it's just a normal DOHC 4.6L V8

These boomers look at ANYTHING to make them feel special about a car. Corvette owners are famous for this. ""My car was the only one built in this color on the tuesday of this month!"" and other similar bullshit that doesn't matter.

This summer my car had an oil leak and though I didn’t notice any leakage, and got regular oil changes, apparently the car was burning the oil and it blew the engine. At least this is what my mechanic said. That fault is probably mine, and because I love my car I opted to purchase a used engine and replace mine.

I told him that’s strange since I replaced the alternator myself not long ago. He told me he could do the work or I could go exchange the alternator under warranty from where I purchased it. I opted to do that. Only when I tried, the gentleman at the parts store informed me that this was not the alternator that I had purchased from them and to contact my mechanic immediately to collect mine from the engine they removed. My mechanic insisted he doesn’t put random parts in peoples cars until I brought in the alternator from my car and the information from the parts store for my alternator. Suddenly he said yes, I forgot your alternator was bad so I replaced it and the one currently in your possession is under warranty with us. Now I’m confused because there was no mention of this nor a charge and he specifically instructed me to return it to the parts store under warranty.

Basically, your truck has a system that changes the way air flows through the intake manifold to improve performance and fuel efficiency at different RPMs. That intake manifold runner control stuck open means the flap/valve that’s supposed to move is stuck open when it shouldn't be probably due to a bad actuator, vacuum leak, or gunked-up linkage. The Bank 1 part just means it's on the side of the engine with cylinder 1, which for your 2.3L is the only bank anyway, since it’s an inline 4.

It’s not crazy hard to fix if you’re semi-handy. Could be as simple as a vacuum line that popped off or a cheap part that needs replacing. But yeah, emissions people hate it stuck open messes with airflow and can throw off fuel ratios. Also, not trying to plug anything, but I drive an older truck too and after a couple random surprise failures, I grabbed coverage through CarShield.

Those joints are usually sealed with a ring or ""donut"" gasket. Mostly graphite but held together with a wire mesh. Here is what they look like new.

Also if you cannot get the bottom bolt apart, you can always cut it off in the gap with a hacksaw or grinder and simply replace the bolts and springs with new ones, they aren't very expensive. Once you get the pipes apart, be sure to clean both sealing surfaces with a wire brush and remove any remnants of old gasket or wire left from the old one. Hope this helps!"

* Is managing email/message quote requests a significant time sink for you or your parts department?
* Do you feel like you're in a ""race to respond first"" against other suppliers?
* Roughly how long does it take to get a simple quote (e.g., price and availability for a part on a specific VIN) out the door?

A high reading like that (Over 10%) indicates there is too much air or too little fuel coming into the engine.

From the live data it looks like both sides of the engine have that lean condition so either you have a very large air leak, too little fuel pressure from the fuel pump or the MAF (Mass Air Flow) sensor is faulty. 

To check for an air leak spray brake clean around the intake hoses with the engine is running and if the fuel trims go negative that is the area of the leak to inspect. Also check for hissing noises while the engine is running.

The mass air flow sensor could be removed and cleaned with brake clean but be light when spraying the element in the sensor and wait until it is fully dry before re-installing it. If the fuel trim % starts to go down the sensor was dirty so that is a temporary fix but should be replaced. There isn't a spec available on what it should be reading but typically it will be very close to the engine size so if your vehicle is a 2.0L it would read about 2-3g/s at idle.

The fuel pressure for this car is 35-55psi at idle. 

The spark plugs and fuel injectors are very unlikely to cause any issues with the fuel trims. The only way for the fuel injectors to cause this condition is if all of them are very clogged but is not common. 

  
Can't really help with the noises too much. If the noise is making several consecutive popping noises in forward or reverse (Typically when making a turn with the wheel turned all the way) that is usually a CV axle is worn and should be replaced especially if the boot is torn and all the grease has leaked out but identifying noises is pretty difficult without physically feeling and hearing the noise."

Doing things just because you want to is kind of silly and wasteful. 

That said, at that age, the car is probably ready for quite a bit of work. 

As for diagnostics, probably not the ball joint, but that doesn’t mean it’s not worn.

On vehicles with upper and lower ball joints, a single thunk when leaning into a turn is a common sign of bad ball joints. But your car only has lowers since it has struts up top. 

Repeated clicking in a turned, usually relative to vehicle speed, is a bad outer CV joint on the axle half shaft. 

So, your car could be ready for…

Brake pads/Rotors

Wheel hub bearings

2 CV Axles

Inner and Outer Tie Rod Ends

Sway Bar Links

Lower ball joints

Struts

That’s just the front end. All of which can be independently checked/evaluated for working condition. (Suspension bushings might also be an issue necessitating replacement of new parts like a lower control arm, but that’s less likely than the listed items.)

If you too far into the steering suspension stuff, it actually is better to do more rather than less for a few reasons.

1) You want symmetrical parts of the car (left and right) to wear evenly.

2) Replacing an outer tie rod end while leaving a worn inner tie rod end can cause wear issues on the new parts.

3) You’ll need to get an alignment for several of the listed parts, so it’s better to pay for 1 alignment than several. Failure to get an alignment when called for will cost you hundreds of dollars in tires over the long term.

You can use an angle grinder, but once the spinning wire brush catches a corner, the torque will rip the angle grinder out of your hands and it can be dangerous. Use compressed air to blow all the corrosion away. Then wipe down with isopropyl to clean. After all is wiped down and cleaned, spray the areas with rust inhibitor, prime, and paint. Allow adequate time to dry between applications. Rattle can stuff like rustoleum works fine for minor rust. 

If you have flaking, you’ll need to get all the flakes off with the wire wheel. It doesn’t have to be perfect, because the rust inhibitor takes care of that by converting the oxidation to a hard, paintable material. Be sure to hit every area, because if you don’t, the rust will spread.

For the body panels, you’re gonna have to sand it down to bare metal.

I don’t think it’s the radiator cap because that tends to spew pressurized coolant toward the hood/valve cover. It would be everywhere, dried, white specks or streaks. 

It takes a few minutes to swap a hose, but you’ll need to drain some of the coolant first. Both look like they’re the OGs so it’s not a bad idea to replace them anyway. Replacing the radiator isn’t difficult if you’ve done it before, and if you haven’t, YouTube can help. If it’s the reservoir, that’s just a minute or two. 

If you want to trace the exact spot where it’s leaking, a pressure test or coolant dye will help pinpoint the source. A mechanic can do the pressure test or you can pick up a tester at harbor freight for less than $50. UV dye and a small UV flashlight are cheap and can be DIY. 

Just in case - never, never, never mess with coolant till the engine is completely cooled. 200° pressurized coolant tends to cause 3rd degree burns on hands, arms, and face.

So, my car (2016 Toyota Corolla) started to have this problem after I took it to a shop for a brake inspection. I believe they might’ve damaged it, like an accident in some way, and didn’t tell me about it.

**The symptom:** 

Whenever my car is completely stopped and I shift from park to drive, from drive to reverse, and back to drive, I hear the popping noise each time. It’s in the front, driver side. Then, I hear the same noise again while driving over bumps, potholes, and when coming to a complete stop at a traffic light. And a couple of times when I move again. I also hear sometimes while turning corners at low speeds.

I only hear the sound randomly while driving below 40 miles per hour. Not all the bumps, potholes, or corners will trigger the sound. In fact, some big irregularities on the road will not trigger the sound at all. And sometimes, I would drive for more than 5 to 8 miles on normal roads with bumps and absolutely nothing will happen. And no sound at all above 40 miles and driving on the freeway. No vibrations, no pulling to the side, no steering issues at all. Just drives normal as usual plus the annoying popping sound from time to time.

In the morning when it’s cold, I hear it again when putting the car on drive, and driving at 25 miles speed on a residential street. Every little bump triggers the sound. Then, I cannot hear anything when I take the main road, reaching 40 miles per hour, and nothing again on the freeway. In the afternoons when it gets hot close to 90 degrees, the noise becomes nonexistent, to the point it becomes a click sound rather than a pop.



I went to 3 different shops and they just can’t seem to find the real issue.

**Shop #1:** Says the CV joint was the issue. Shows picture of leaking boot and I approve the replacement. Did not fix the noise problem. Took car back but they said everything is normal and they cannot hear the sound at all.

**Shop #2:** They found somewhat bent sway bar links. I approve the repair. Popping sound continues. Then they say my car also needed a lower control arm replacement. I decline the job and go to shop #3 for a second opinion.

**Shop #3:** Finds no issues with the control arms or ball joints. They say it can be a wearing engine and/or transmission mount. Whether I want the repair now or later, it’s up to me to decide, but should keep in mind the risks I choose to take. I say I will think about it and go to shop #4.

**Shop #4:** Says the issue is the CV joint. But I just had it replaced a few weeks before at shop #1. When I mention it, they say it doesn’t look so. But they don’t take to my car to show me. They also say the wheel bearing needs to be replaced and it’s most likely the main cause of the noise. But they cannot guarantee that the noise will go away until I replace the CV axle. I had searched the symptoms online and it definitely did not match the wheel bearing issue at all. I decline the job leaving the shop extremely confused.

You still have to put in some work, but they will help you narrow down the search until you find the cause.

Attach mics to/near multiple suspect areas and then listen to each feed and watch the EQ indicators to determine which mic is on or closest to the source of the noise.

Best done with partner, so one can focus on the device while the other drives.

* **June 2025:** My car was involved in a driver's-side sideswipe collision. Visually, it looked to be minimal, but it did travel from the front bumper all the way to the rear.
* **July 2025:** The car was sent to local BMW Collision center for insurance-covered repairs.
* **July–September:** The car was returned to me multiple times with unresolved issues — pulling, vibration, and a loose headlight that was never properly installed. Each time I was told it was “fixed.”
* **Early October:** I escalated my concerns because the car still wasn’t right and I’d lost all trust in their work.
* **Mid-October (this week):** The service department contacts me claiming a **“ruptured coolant hose”** was found and the repair cost would be **$1,735.12**. They also sent a video showing coolant residue — but not an active leak. Once escalated, they sent me another video that showed an active leak - pretty much pouring. Keep in mind, the advisor even stated that this leak was **NOT** present when the car was released to them, proving that this happened on their watch.

Here’s the thing that really bothers me:

* **No one was performing any work under the hood** when this supposed rupture occurred.
* The only under-hood inspection happening at the time was on the **driver’s side headlight**, which had been improperly installed by their own collision center.
* The hose that “ruptured” is located *very close* to that headlight assembly area.

So I’m wondering — **how likely is it** that a coolant hose just *ruptures on its own*, with no one working on or near it?  
Could it have been bumped, twisted, or damaged while someone was reinstalling or inspecting the headlight?

Also, how would you (as a tech or shop manager) typically prove or document that a hose failure like that wasn’t caused by handling or stress during prior work?

For context, this car has had a slow coolant issue for months, but every shop that’s looked at it — including one earlier this year — suspected a **heater core** problem, multiple pressure tests, not a front hose failure.

Now, after all these months and repeated back-and-forth with this BMW dealer, I’m being told that the hose “just ruptured” while in their care and that I need to pay for it.

At this point, trust is gone. I’m having the car towed out and escalating through BMW corporate, BBB, and possibly the state.

  
But before I go that route, I’d love to hear from people who actually know these systems —  
👉 **Is it common or even plausible for a coolant hose to rupture on its own, with zero work happening under the hood?**

1o3xnyp,Honda Maintenance Question,"Hi All, 

Last year at the end of December, we bought a 2025 Honda CRV Sport Hybrid.  Everyone at Honda that I speak to - including dealerships - all tell me don't worry about mileage, just change the oil when the maintenance minder hits 15%, or 1 year, whichever occurs first.     
   
As someone who grew up with 3000 miles or 3 years on dino oil, and 6000 miles or 6 months on synthetic ride or die, this makes me incredibly nervous.     
   
We're currently at 6800 miles on the factory fill and sitting at 20%.  Just spoke with a Honda dealership (two, actually) and they're like ""You get a free oil change at 15%.  Trust the maintenance minder.  You're fine.""     
   
I get that Synthetic oils are designed to last a lot longer, and in fact, I would catch a sample and send it to blackstone labs in our old car (A 2021 Nissan Rogue, I know, I'm sorry, my wife loved it) every oil change.  There was always plenty of life left in the samples.       
   
Independent shops say ""Of course they want you to do extended oil changes, they want to sell you more cars!""  Manufacturers say ""We have science behind this going back to the 1980s from Dr. Shirley Schwartz saying this is accurate!""    
   
Lake Speed Jr even did a video saying ""this is fine"".    
   
What say y'all? Trust this maintenance minder?  I'm pretty sure in 5 years we'll trade it and get something different - that's just kinda what we do.

Or maybe there's just something loose that is catching.  

You can generally see at least the outer pad through the wheel.  If you remove the wheel you can look at both sides, to see the condition of the pads and the rotor.

If the pads or rotor are worse on one side than the other, that's a sign the caliper slides are probably seized.

If the wheel doesn't turn freely, that's a sign that either the piston or slides (or both) are seized.  If its the piston it will drag on both sides.

1o42uxj,I built an automation tool for quote requests. Need a reality check from industry pros (no links),"Hey everyone,

I'm a software developer, not a parts tech, but I'm trying to solve a problem I've seen slow down a lot of shops: managing and responding to email quote requests.

The problem I see: Shops get dozens of email requests. While the team is busy, on the phone, or just away from the computer, potential sales are lost to faster competitors. Industry stats show 78% of sales go to the first responder.

My solution: I built a simple automated system that acts as an automatic ""salesperson"". It:

1. watches a dedicated email inbox.
2. automatically finds the VIN/part info in the email.
3. checks the shop's inventory (even a simple Google Sheet).
4. instantly replies to the customer with price, availability, and an ""Order"" button.

The whole process takes under 30 seconds and works 24/7.

I need a reality check from people who actually live this every day. Is this genuinely useful, or am I missing something crucial about how shops really work?

For their age, they actually aren't too bad for rust. But the intakes on the rear wings, sill seam, and subframe can corrode so check carefully.

They also have hydraulic suspension, excellent for dealing with the UKs horrible roads but can be a problem of it breaks. For that reason, I would recommend the later TF.

At the time I bought the car, I was insistent I’d only buy one with full service history. They showed me the service history and it was as follows:

-Nov 21: 5,500 miles

-Nov 23: 20,000 miles

-Feb 25: 25,000 miles

It’d also had an undated main dealer health check done at around 12,000 miles, presumably some time in 2022.

I queried the missing 2022 service and they told me it only needed servicing every 2 years, so insisted it had full service history (I was less concerned about the “delayed” 2024 one as the car was SORN - previously owned by the main dealer themselves so presumably was used around the depot). For reassurance, I asked them to put it in writing for me - which they did, and I bought the car. I also got a 3 year used approved warranty with it. 



**The Problem**: I’ve since gone away and done more research, including contacting the manufacturer directly,  and as it turns out, it doesn’t have full service history. My model’s servicing is due every 10,000 miles/1yr; it’s only the newer model which due every 20,000 miles/2yr.

Now, I really like the car, and certainly wouldn’t want to return it. But the dealer lying to me like this has left a really sour taste in my mouth. I’m mainly concerned about the potential implications for future resale value. I’m wondering whether to pursue this further (compensation) under the Consumer Rights Act, or whether I’m really making a mountain out of a molehill here. 

Can anyone please advise me?

Statistically those who have one accident, have more accidents - even if they were not the one 'at fault' by definition. A lot of that is because even when one party is 'at fault' - the other party contributed to the accident in some form. Not saying that happened in this case, but it's why it happens.

I do not really know much about car so I paid a friend 4000 to buy a car. I just told him I needed a nice car and because I trusted him I believe he would get me something nice probably something worth 3500 pounds and he can pocket 500 for profit for himself.

after 2 weeks he told me he has purchased a car. I asked him why did he not tell me what kind of car it is and if i am okay with it i will approve the purchase. but he said he had already purchased it and it was a nissan qashqai 2009.

i felt cheated because on fb market this car goes for 1500. but there is nothing i can do so i let it slide as i needed the car urgently because I work in dormiciliary care and i needed the car to visit service user's houses.

the car is so old underneat and its so rusted, I feel the car was involved in a flood.

I tried checking the history with RAC VEHICLE HISTORY CHECKER FULL CHECK PACKAGE but the car came back as noit stolen, not written off, not scrapped, and no color changes. basically the car came back as clean. but my guts tells me this car might have been involved in a flood as the exhaust and engine bay and underneat of the car and all the suspensions is severly corroded. however i do drive the car.

but i need recommendation of the best car checker that can show me genuine history of car in uk with picture of what the car looks like if it were involved in an accident.

I would have loved to paste the reg num but i dont know if that is allowed. so please i need a superior car checker, i just need closure and I need to prove if my guts was right or wrong.

I checked the mot history, it failed mot a few times but nothing signifies heavy flooding, also i learnt along the line that there are dodgy mot shops who pass bad cars after receiving a bribe.

Also, when I bought the car, I was naive—' I still am' because I'm not a car-savvy person, and I'm an immigrant. But along the way, I got to understand how the UK system works. I realised my insurance is heavily dependent on where I live and the kind of car I drive. Even my road tax is so expensive. If I knew all these, I'd have just bought a newer and more recent car.

Unfortunately, it’s happened again within a year,  this time so badly that I had to call for recovery, as the car wouldn’t go above 40 mph and had very little acceleration.

When the “Soot filter full” warning appeared, I tried to clear it by driving on the motorway for about an hour, keeping the revs between 3000–4000 rpm, as online advice suggested. However, it didn’t help, the warning stayed on and eventually the engine light came on in orange.

The RAC inspected it and confirmed they couldn’t clear the DPF; it needs to be cleaned again.

To be honest, I rarely drive long distances anymore. I mostly use the car for short trips (5–15 minutes) twice a day, and only take it on a longer drive maybe once a month. I know that’s not ideal for a diesel engine. When I first bought the car and drove it regularly on longer trips, I never had these issues.

Given all this, I’m wondering, is the DPF problem recurring so soon mainly because I don’t drive it far or often enough, or could there be another underlying issue? Should I just get it cleaned again, or is there something more I should do to prevent it from happening again?

The car is a few years old and comes with a standard 28 days warranty. We’d had the car for 24 hours when a warning light came on and the car went in to idle mode. They arranged pick up the following day. They’ve now had the car for 3 weeks because they were struggling to find the fault. It took them 10 days to get a courtesy car to us, and I’ve chased them for updates daily. They’ve called me yesterday to advise the car was ready to collect and it was a sensor issue. I’ve requested an extended warranty above the 28 days as I don’t trust that something else will go wrong. They’ve blankly refused even though I’ve been hugely inconvenienced by the whole issue. My first month’s payment is due next week, and I haven’t had the car for the majority of the month. I’ve logged a complaint with them which hasn’t been acknowledged (3 weeks ago) and I’ve also logged a complaint with the finance company as instructed by the finance company themselves. I don’t think it’s unreasonable to ask for extended warranty. At this point I’m planning on pulling out of the whole transaction.

1o3qvwx,Cat S Mazda 3 advice needed,"Hi,

I'm considering buying a cat S Mazda 3 as my second car. I would love to get some advice in checks that I should do before buying the car.

I have attached an image of the damage from 2021.

The car is being sold by a garage and was acquired as a part exchange. The car has been fully fixed but I dont have the information of where the fix took place. To me this damage does not look too bad, the frame does not look to be damaged...

I have read online that some people recommend taking the car to a garage for an inspection before buying? Is this a good option? How do I go about doing this, would it be done on a test drive?

I look forward to you're advice?

Also, dumb question but, I'm considering getting a car loan to finance this car. Does it make sense to buy the car with my own money then use the car loan to replenish the money spent?

It's also concerning how many new drivers hit things, I get they're new and need to learn but this whole ""you're a new driver you will hit something"" view needs to stop. Saying that means people are less careful and then are also less caring if they do hit something. I have never hit anything since I started driving and I think that should be the norm. 

Having something like that happen is honestly one of my biggest fears, I love my car and I'd be incredibly angry if some careless idiot comes along and damages it.
