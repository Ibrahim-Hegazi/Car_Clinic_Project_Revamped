Having it take longer when the ac is off is because the load on the alternator is higher when the ac is on.  Not sure what you used to test the alternator with,  but the best way to catch this is too drive the vehicle till it says check the charging system, and have something that can show voltage out put of the alternator at that point. 

 If voltage is ok (should be no less then 13.5-14.5 while running), then immediately load test the system.  Avoid shutting the vehicle more then necessary once this condition happens.  The alternator can cool off enough to give a false positive in this situation if left off long enough to cool off.  This way you can check for a failing diodes and regulator or just the amps are too low when hot."

Car: VW 2010 sedan 1.0 ea111 flex fuel

Situation: Car hesitates to start in the morning or after a few hours. But when I leave it parked pointing downhill it starts great. 

If I park it the other way around or level the engine seems to fire right away for 1 second then it dies and takes about 8-10 seconds to start.

Car known conditions: Battery is strong, engine turns fast. Fuel pump is tested for strength and sealing. Oil, air and gas filters are changed every 3k miles or 6 months. New spark plugs and injectors. No codes on OBD.

I tried:

1. turning the key on and off a few times to prime the fuel pump hoping it was a pump problem (later on I took it out and tested for power and sealing, all good), also the lines remain pressurized after the pump turns off.

2. A.I (don't laugh) told me to try throttling the pedal while turning the key and that would point a defect on the electronic air valve motor not opening enough, It makes the car start right away but then it dies after 5 seconds instead of 1, and then it will keep dying after 5 seconds for the next 4-6 attempts, it will start backfire on the exhaust for a few seconds and stabilize.

1oy6iei,Brake pedal won’t firm up after towing and fluid reservoir is full,"Hey everyone I could use some advice with whats going on with my 2013 vw Passat. 

Here’s what had happened:
My car was towed to a different parking lot in my apartment complex because they were repainting the parking spots. (And had literally sent out an email notice the evening before that I did not see) When I went to retrieve it and tried to reverse it out the parking spot the brakes weren’t working properly. The car would roll backwards when reversing, even when I pressed the brake pedal, and I had to quickly put it in park to stop it. 

Since then, I checked the brake fluid reservoir and it’s full. I also tried pumping the brakes with the car in park but the pedal doesn’t firm up or lock like it should, it stays soft. There are no visible brake fluid leaks under the car that I can see. 

The brake pedal feels soft and doesn’t build pressure even after pumping several times. I haven’t driven the car much since and have only tested it by reversing it and pulling it back up (barely any) in a parking spot because I’m worried about brake failure.

I’ve read that this could be caused by air in the brake lines or a failing master cylinder. How can I test if the master cylinder is bad? Is it common for the master cylinder to fail even when fluid levels are fine? Could getting towed also be the cause of this?

I took it to a mechanic who only test drove it and quoted me $6,200 for a full transmission replacement with a 2-year warranty, claiming the “damage has already been done” because of the torque converter. They didn’t scan any codes, saying it would take hours.

I’ve read about GM Campaign 2810875, which updates the TCM to prevent hard downshifts but I’m not sure if that’s worked for anybody.

Potential mechanical causes like slip yoke, U-joints, differential, or torque converter I’ve considered, but the mechanic was insistent that it’s the transmission. He could be right but I wanted to get more opinions.

Questions:

Has anyone experienced these symptoms on a 2019 Silverado 8-speed?

Did a TCM reprogram / software update fix it, or was a full transmission actually needed?

Could this be something simple like slip yoke, fluid, or torque converter instead of full replacement? Can’t quite afford a full replacement right now.

He has to top up oil every month it gets all the way to the lowest mark on the dipstick also few weeks ago the temp gauge went all the way to the max but would go up and down heat also wasn’t working which led me to believe there was not any coolant in it we checked and it was bone dry ( he did not mix it with distilled water even though it needed to be mixed ) is that important like should it be changed asap ? And also how can I explain to him it’s leaking oil not burning no blue smoke coming out either. (I’m 16 which is probably why he won’t let me replace the gaskets ) how can I get him to stop thinking it’s burning oil and it’s a leak instead

1oy4ii3,Mercedes GL rear shocks rant!,"Shade tree mechanic here. Not looking for advice so much as needing to vent.  I have a hobby garage with a lift.  Just replaced the rear shocks (not air bags) on my 2012 GL550.  It was…brutal. The design to access the upper bolt mounts is horrible.

Rear bolt on the lower control arm is easy.  But the top of the shock is mounted to the inner wheel well on the inside.  The mounting point is concealed under the rear interior panels.  Underneath the panels there is tons of cabling and there is SEALED INSULATION on top of the wheel well and the top mounting bolts are concealed under the insulation.  Sealed and buried.  No markings.  So you have to fully remove the panels or pry them back - as there is no access panel (Failure 1).  You’ll break some plastic tabs doing this.  Then you have to estimate where the top bolts are and CUT AWAY the insulation - massive design Failure 2.  What the hell is this sh!t.  Then once you’ve made a mess of the insulation you can remove the bolts.

What a gong show of a job.  Every engineer - or more likely some twat exec - involved in this design should have to replace a dozen of these back to back, alone and without assistance, for some perspective

Just idiotic.  Stuff like this is inexcusable for a wear part like a shock that’s going to fail.

 why corrosion.. most electrons travel on the surface of the conductors.. if the surface is corroded the electrons can't get thru easily. 

 you can narrow the test locations. after you run the six steps..

 if test 6.. alternator to battery positive has 0.3 vdc..  test from the alternator output stud threads to the ring terminal bolted to them.. then test to to the 140amp fuse. then from the fuse to the big master fuse. then to the battery terminal and the stuff bolted to that.

If not, I'd start with a fuel pressure test. Just because you can hear your fuel pump doesn't mean it's moving sufficient fuel at sufficient pressure.

Also, if the alternator has gone out, your battery is powering everything. It needs about 9V to run the engine, but far less to power accessories. Charge the battery completely and see if it starts.

preparingtodie (Score: 1): The problem is not that you changed the oil 2000 miles later than usual.  Don't worry about that.

Since you hear the pump priming, and presumably you have fuel in the tank, then it's unlikely to be a fuel problem.  It's also unlikely to be a compression problem if the car just suddenly completely died.

I think the most likely thing is a broken timing belt.

It could be something else with the spark delivery, like a bad relay or coil."

Did you change the spark plug boot? The springs in those wear out. I buy the whole bosch coil/plug boot from rock auto for around 35$ per. 


Check coil pack wiring harness plug for a broken black lock tab under the grey pull-out tab. If that lock tab is broken, the coil pack wiring plug can shake loose. Youll know if the black lock tab is broken if you slide the plug in and there is no audible ""click"" and it pulls right back off. If no click, zip tie the plug to the pack and check to see if misfire is eliminated. 


If no, then..


Cheap bluetooth obd2 diag from amazon with live data. I use ediag elite, gives me access to almost everything on mercedes m278 and no further fees after purchase.  Virtual compression test it with the ediag phone app. Low compression misfire is stuck piston rings or scored cylinder walls or burnt exhaust valves. (Burnt exhaust valve on m278 may still be under a recall, youll have to check)

If low compression, Cheap directional bluetooth borescope from amazon. Remove spark plug, insert borescope. Burnt exhaust valve is obvious. Scored cylinder walls is obvious. If none of the above, possibly stuck piston rings. You can manually turn the engine clockwise by crank with 27mm or 1"" 1/16 socket to see the cylinder bore.


 Carbon buildup on intake valves is an issue on di gas engines, yes. But it doesnt seem to be a major thing on m278s. And i would suspect it would affect more than 1 cylinder. Its impossible to know without removing the intercooler and intake unless its obvious a valve isnt seating fully from borescope looking. Carbon could be freezing your piston rings, there is various chemical ways of cleaning carbon from rings. However, if piston ring is stuck, likely the cylinder walls are scored also.


If compression is fine, toggle the injector on and off via the actuation test on the ediag app while the car is running. Check for fuel rail pressure dropping immediately after the car is turned off. If no obvious fast drop in fuel pressure, and you can hear the idle signifcantly change during actuation tests, injector is likely fine. 


If all that checks out good, i would swap the spark plug/boot/ coil pack  out 1 more time just to make sure the new ones arent bad out of the box. Tho the odds are lottery worthy, if the new coil pack you installed was dropped prior to you, it may not work correctly. Also, use bosch only or mercedes parts if you want to overpay for bosch parts. 


If i still had a misfire after all of that, then i would give up and schedule an appointment. Could be a wiring harness issue which requires oscilliscope and known good waveforms.

Just did some regular maintenance on my 2017 Honda Civic 2.0 w CVT/Auto Trans and now I hear a pretty loud click on the parking brake (actuator??)

I changed the CVT Transmission fluid, made sure the car was leveled and refilled the trans until it had a drip from the drain plug. Started the car shifted the gears and noticed it was not dripping anymore. So I put more on it, until I saw the flow again from the Drain Plug.

Put everything back together started the car and immediately noticed the loud actuator thingy going on. 

Took it for test drive and has no leaks, no weird sounds, no issues shifting or reving up.

Note/Additional Context: Last week I did a full brake job (Rotors, pads and Brake fluid change/flush). Pretty successful, with great braking, no weird issues, sounds or anything. After the brake job, the parking actuator was perfectly fine and sounded pretty silent like always.

I am not a mechanic (hence my posting here) but, I am familiar with an oil change an please correct me if I am wrong but the crush gasket should be replaced at every oil change by the service station correct?

I got my son's oil change (older car, 08' Accord) and while there they said it needed additional work. I had taken it there since it was right up the street but for a second opinion I took it to a buddies shop. When we had it on the lift we saw they never put a crush gasket on and in turn it had a leak. I called the shop that did the change and this guy is arguing with me trying to say that the car didnt have a gasket (which may have been true) and that it didnt need a gasket and the leak is from something else and they just torque the drain plug tight. He then said that if a gasket is there they will just continue to reuse them during a change. I explained how continuing to torque the plug is bad and that even though the car didnt have one that they should have put one on. Its an every change thing! 

Im just making sure I was in the right here. Im sure not every car needs them, I wont argue that. This one did and Im almost positive they should have put one on.

The truck was running fine around 4-6 months ago when it was parked. Went to start it the other day and wouldn't start. Some checks showed I had fuel to the rail with good pressure but no spark. I have so far replaced:  ignition coil, ignition control module, spark plugs, plug wires, and the distributor. I can get it to start now but it is hard to start and has a rough idle. Shakes like a dog trying to poop a peach pit. With some fighting and throttle pumping it will run better as it warms up but you can tell it still isn't right. It has very little to no power in drive. My current thoughts are possible ECU or MAP. I am fairly confident I kept timing right when I replaced the distributor. No 1 @ TDC via both counterbalance marks and a zip tie in the spark plug hole. There is no change in the engine's running when the MAP is plugged in or not so I don't believe it is that. I only think ECU because I made the error of charging the battery with it still in the truck and only after remembering the ECU on Ford in the 90's had some issues with blowing a capacitor. Having little experience with distributor engines I don't even know how much of a role the ECU plays in the engine's operation. I am not a mechanic but have always done my own vehicle work and this one has me scratching my head. Any advice is welcome.

No abnormal indle noises, no overheating, no white exhaust smoke, heater fan blows hot air as it should.

  I took it to two different shops and they each told me different problems:

Shop A told me that the head gasket was damaged and that I had antifreeze in my oil. 

Shop B told me that it is not a head gasket issue, and that I have condensation in my oil from not driving it enough and letting it get up to operating temperature.

But honestly without knowing for sure what’s in the oil you have no directive. It could just be condensation from the oil not regularly getting up to temp to evaporate water. At 100 miles a week you’re probably going a year between changes so that water can really add up. So I would tend to agree with shop B. To verify shop A’s claim I would check your coolant level. If it’s full just make a habit moving forward of taking it on a 30+ mile drive at least once a month and if you’re comfortable, an Italian tuneup should do it some good too."

If it's just on that side and not anywhere else, good chance it'll be the camshaft seal or crankshaft seal. Or both.

If it's also on the transmission side too, it could be a bad valve cover gasket, vtec solenoid gasket (if u have vtec) and/or the cam plug.

Id check in this order.
1) is there oil leaking down from both sides or just the one side.
2) is there leakage around the valve cover? (Be sure to check around the entire thing because it may only leak from one side)
3) Is there oil near the EGR, where the cam plug is?
4) Oil leaking from the VTEC solenoid?

5) After all these checks, if there's only oil leaking from the engine side, then it'll probably be ur crank and/or cam seal. While ur in there you might as well replace both.


Reason for the order is bc it's a bigger pain in the ass to get to and change the crank and cam seals compared to the others. Tbh, while you already got the engine apart, you might as well change everything I listed above. Also GL. I just did this job and it's kinda a pain in the ass.

As far as i know they don't have the same toxic vapor leaks (yes toxic - the oil on the engines makes me feel sick if i smell the vapors after about 30 or so miles of driving) But the issue with electric cars is that you cannot leave them sitting so long that the battery drains because this will not only damage the very expensive to replace battery but also even damage other components of the car. The other issue with both is rusting undercarriage here in the Northeast (a major issue i had that i had to also get rid of a car soon after purchase as it wouldn't pass inspection) unless they are aluminum like the Tesla model S and X - but this brings me back to the battery loss issue if left for over a year or so to drain.

I did the clutch test and the engine did stall but it was right at the end of lifting my foot off the pedal.

Also, you can get a mechanic’s stethoscope to nail down exactly where it is coming from. They are cheap, they look like a stethoscope but have a long pointy thing instead of a round smooth thing.

I’m attempting to replace my own spark plugs for the first time to save money. My car has around 170,000 km, and as far as I know, the plugs have never been replaced.

I’m using:

* 3/8"" ratchet
* 14mm 12-point magnetic socket
* 10"" extension

I removed the coil packs without any issues, but when I tried to remove the first spark plug (far left), it wouldn’t budge at all. I didn’t want to force it and risk snapping the plug or damaging the threads, so I stopped.

I saw some people recommend using WD-40 or penetrating lubricant around the plug threads, but I’m worried about it leaking into the engine and causing contamination. Can someone clarify whether that’s safe or suggest a better approach?

Any tips appreciated, I’d love to get this done safely without causing more problems, otherwise I'm just going to ask my mechanic to do it and provide him with the spark plugs I got.

The first plug has oil all around its base, so your penetrating oil probably isn't gonna help much. If you use a penetrant, make sure you don't put anything silicone based down there, as it might pollute your catalytic converter.

Apply more force, making sure that while one hand is pulling on the handle of the ratchet that your other hand is pushing with the same force on the head of the ratchet. You don't want any side forces reaching the spark plug, only turning forces. Use a breaker bar(or pipe on the handle end of the ratchet) if needed.

Auto shop put their code reader on it which read Engine coil Bank 1  
Part was  $68 they charged me $30 for labor.

Drove off and about 1/2 mile down the road it started hoping again and engine light was flashing.  
Auto shop said they could charge me a couple thousand for a new catalytic convertor but the muffler shop downtown could clean it out for much less.  If I choose to do that they would have a better chance of finding the issues with clean converters .

Muffler shop cleaned them out for $327  
Said one was mucked up and kinda  wet and the other was really dirty.  
It drove better but the engine light still flashed.  
I dropped it back off to the auto shop

After 2 days of working on it the auto shop said they don't know why it still hops.  
They called Toyota and they won't give them any info on how to fix it.  
Toyota said I need to bring my car to them so they can hook  their,  ""Special"",  error code machine to my car to diagnose the problem.

Auto shop said they didn't think I should spent a whole lot more on the car.

I just had new tires, front and back brakes and 2 CV joints installed over the last 7 months.

I really don't want to buy another car. I love this car.

Hi folks- I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit, but it seemed like a good place to start. About two weeks ago I hit a curb hard, and ended up cracking a wheel and got two flat tires. One tire has been replaced, but I've had a donut on where the cracked wheel happened since (I know- but I work remotely and live in a city anyway, so I don't have to do too much driving in my day to day). I've finally been able to find a decently priced wheel replacement (waiting for it to come in), and can get another tire easily enough. But I'm wondering how to go about installation? Should I call around to local auto body shops asking if they offer installation for customer-supplied parts? Is there a particular kind of shop I should look into? The shop I was referred to for a potential wheel repair said it wasn't fixable (hence why I got a replacement), but that they don't offer installation. Sorry, I don't know much about this, I'm just trying to get this fixed as economically as possible before the holidays.

1oy2m7z,Help making sense of a conversation with the auto shop,"I have a 2012 Honda Civic, 58k miles. (If that seems low, it's because I don't commute to work by car.)

Took it to the shop for B12 maintenance.   
B = oil & filters, multi-point inspection  
1 = tire rotation  
2 = replace air cleaner element, replace dust/pollen filter, inspect drive belt

I live in a mid sized town in the Northeastern US. I have used this shop before, but only for a state inspection. I recently moved to the area. I figure B12 is so routine, how could anybody mess that up? So anyway, they did the service and afterwards I paid over the phone and arranged to pick it up after hours from the lot. So far so good.

Went to pick up my car and the air system is making a new sound. The sound comes from the front passenger side, inside the dashboard, approximately just behind the glove compartment. It makes a buzz when the heat or AC is turned on and sounds papery to me, like a loose corner of an air filter.   
  
Left the car on the lot and left the service advisor a note. He called me the next morning and our conversation went something like this:

Me: My car is making a new sound that it was not making before the service.  
Service advisor: What does it sound like?  
Me: \[described the sound\]  
SA: That was happening before we serviced your car. We assumed you knew about it so I didn't mention whe we settled up over the phone.   
Me: No, the sound was not happening before.  
SA: It is a bearing in the motor of the air system. It's making that sound because it's old.  
Me: It was not making the sound before you serviced the car and now it is, so I think you should fix it as part of my service.  
SA: \[Tries to convince me that their mechanic did not cause the sound.\]  
Me: Can you fix it?  
SA: Yes. We'd have to replace the whole motor.  
Me: How much would it cost?  
SA: I'll call you back in 15 minutes with an estimate.

Service advisor called back an hour later when I was in a work meeting and left a short message asking me to call but not providing the estimate. Closed for the weekend by the time I tried to call back. I picked up my car because I live in a single car household and need my family needs the car this weekend.

The big questions:  
**1. Should I consider paying this shop to fix the noise? Should they fix it without charging me?**   
**2. Should I trust them to fix my car in the future?** 

There are a couple other things too:  
a. The invoice they left in my car does not have a multi-point inspection report. The closest it gets is to say ""looked over car and checked all items on b12 service"". I know enough to know I should expect an inspection report.  
b. Tire pressure indicator was on when I dropped off the car and off when I picked it up. No mention of this on the invoice or from the service advisor. I would have expected this to appear on the inspection report, but in the absence of an inspection report, shouldn't they have mentioned it?  
c. One of the filters scheduled for maintenance was replaced 2000 miles ago when the last mechanic found a mouse nest in it. This might be on me since I didn't mention it to them because I had forgotten to check my car's maintenance log before I took it in to the shop. However, I would have hoped that they would notice it seemed strangely new and ask me before replacing it. Service advisor did not mention it at all. I don't know enough about filters to know if this would have been noticeable to the mechanic.

I own a 2011 Toyota Camry with 247, 500 km's (153790 miles\~) that needs repairs. Find attached the breakdown of my vehicle inspection by Toyota. The price all adds to about **$4200** including the dealers labor (obv high). But in addition my catalytic converter is going where they said that could be around $3k, but they did suggest a muffler place to do that work which would be cheaper. I haven't had time to reach out to them yet regarding a rough cost. But assuming $1500 or so. I also already put $2200 of work this January for my exhaust system separate of the cat.

is it worth fixing? I love my vehicle and it still drives fine. The rear suspension is noticeable over small bumps right now but not a bit issue yet. I am just worried about dumping money into this vehicle when I maybe should invest that money into a newer (but used) vehicle.

But obviously buying a new vehicle would be a lot more expensive probably looking at $19k with tax including so a 15-16k for a reliable car. I am a bit torn, I think most people would take this as a sign to buy a newer car but I am quite conservative with my money spending. If I were to look at a new Camry any suggestions if you think fixing my Camry isn't worth my money/time like good years / how low of a year would you go. Like is buying now a 2013 car crazy?

1oxjht1,Please help!,"Hi- sorry in advance if I sound like I don’t know what I’m talking about, because I really don’t. I’m hoping someone out there knows what’s going on and maybe has a solution. 

I bought a 2017 Kia Soul Wagon 4D 1.6L 14 in June 2024. 

It was fine & dandy until Feb 2025, when it broke down for the first time. What happened was my fuel gauge randomly went down & read as empty (while I was driving) even though I had filled the tank fairly recently. It went back to normal after I stopped and added more fuel. I then went to see a movie & when I went to leave, my car made it maybe 15 feet out of the spot & stopped. I was pressing on the gas petal but the RPM was not moving/my car was not moving or making any sound at all. It was still “on” though. But when I turned it off, and tried to turn it on again, the engine wouldn’t turn over. I had to end up asking a cop to help me get it into a spot. But then my engine did turn over, and I waited in the parking lot & called a tow truck. My Dad called his friend who works on cars & the guy told him it might be the fuel pump. He ended up changing the fuel pump for a new one & it began to work normally again.

But… only for a month. In March 2025, the same thing happened. I would press the gas & nothing would happen. No car movement or RPM movement. When testing the car (turning it on/off), we did not hear the fuel pump kick on, like the little hum noise. So we assumed it was that again. So he bought another fuel pump, because he admitted apparently the other one was not good quality, so he got a better one. Replaced it, and it was good. 

Until July 2025. This is when I was extremely lucky… I was visiting my boyfriend who lives 2hrs away and I have to drive on a major highway. I noticed that when my car’s speedometer said “50”, by GPS said I was going “55”. I just thought it was a calibration issue. But I noticed that if I pressed on the gas more, I would not speed up at all past 50. Thankfully I was able to make it to a restaurant where I met up with my boyfriend & after eating, we went to leave… My car didn’t start!!! 

There was a cop in the parking lot and I assumed maybe I needed a jump, but he didn’t have cables. So, we were stranded & had to call a tow truck to take my car 2 hours back to my house. 

So, my dad talked to his friend again & they thought maybe it’s the fuel pump connector. Idk if that’s the correct term but it’s the little white piece on top of the fuel pump. So he got a new connector, and it started working fine again! 

Until the end of August 2025, when my car started stalling when going up hill or speeding up past like 20mph. The RPM could not go over 2 x 1000. I had to turn it off, wait, turn it back on, and slowly drive home. Sometimes it wouldn’t turn over. Luckily I was only 10 minutes away from home this time, but it was stressful and scary for me. 

After all of this, I finally begged my Dad to please let us take it to a mechanic because clearly this needs professional diagnosing.  

Anyways, we took it to a mechanic early Sept 2025, and he said it was the connector & found one online and changed it. My car worked so I drove it home, yay. 

A week later, I tried driving my car & got 2 minutes from the house & it stalled again, RPM did not want to go over 2 x 1000. Slowly drove home. 

Took it back to the mechanic, and my car has been there ever since. It has been over 2 months, my car has been sitting at the mechanic with no answer. 

I’m really frustrated because I work from home & my car is my freedom, I feel stranded and the mechanic isn’t fixing my car. 

I don’t know what to do, maybe we should find someone else. Maybe it’s a clogged fuel injector? I don’t know if he checked for that. He also messed up my speakers, they were perfectly fine but when I picked it up from him only 1 was working and it was super quiet. 

I hope I explained this well enough that someone, anyone, could give me any sort of hint or help at what is wrong with my car.

Are there any pros / cons to either quick struts or the OEM parts that I need to know? Are there manufacturers that make high quality quick struts?

If I go the OEM route, I’ll have someone replace them for me so I don’t have to risk a spring shooting through the wall of my shop.

You need to take that back apart and clean all the RTV off. Using silicone on the oil pump is a great way to blow your motor up. The bit that squirts out on the inside will eventually come loose and plug up an oil gally. You need an OEM metal gasket, don't use anything else.

1oy5h68,I'm An Idiot And Would Like Some Advice,"So, as the title suggests, I'm an idiot. 

I have a 2004 GMC Envoy XUV with the 5.3L Vortec and the 4L60e. 

Like all of these end up, the 3-4 clutches failed at 165,000 miles. So, I decided to fully rebuild the transmission myself, and it went fairly well! It ended up performing great with a higher stall converter for about a year. 

2 weeks ago, the converter bolts apparently had been backing (no noises to warn me) and I lost all transmission pressure sitting at a stoplight. 

I had no idea what was going on, so I was free revving the engine up to 3000 RPM to see if I could hear anything and got big judder and a shake, so switched off the engine. 

When I got it towed home oil was leaking from around the driver side steering rack. I let it sit for a couple days before getting under it. I found that the converter was decoupled from the flex plate. I also noticed some crazy oil leaks along the motor. The aforementioned leak along the back driver's side down onto the steering rack, but also both front corners of the oil pan had drips and stains on the ground. 

After a few hours of digging around, taking pictures, and taking video I determined the oil leak was coming from the top rear of the motor on the drivers side and then leaking forward along the valley cover edges, down the timing chain cover, and dripping off the front two edges of the oil pan as well. That took a couple days to show itself though. 

So, I guess my question is, what mechanism could have caused the big judder that shook the truck and did it cause my oil pressure sensor on the rear driver side to blow? From what I can tell as well, the oil pressure sensor is not leaking out the top but around the crush washer on the bottom. The pressure sensor top is fully dry. There's no other oil lines or anything back there from what I can tell either.

I'm pulling the transmission right now to check the flex plate and remove any bolts that may still be stuck between the plate and the engine. 

My current theory is that the judder was from a bolt getting caught between the flex plate teeth and the bellhousing. But, could a judder that aggressive cause the pressure sensor to fail like that? Out the crush washer? Where else could oil be originating from back there if not the pressure sensor crush washer?

The 2nd time I brought it in to Pep Boys they found that my back left caliper was missing a bolt and told me that it was due to shifting of the breaks (since it was not being held  in place) that I was getting the squeaking and grinding and that it should fix the problem as all my pads are still fine. Its good that a bolt is now there but Im still getting the same squeaking and grinding noise from my breaks.

 I called them back and was told that if I wanted to get rid of the noise it would be best to just replace the pads but they told me again that my pads still had a lotta life in them so Im at a loss.

I just want to know if it’s necessary to change. I do feel vibration in the steering wheel and on my seat when I drive faster than 120 km/h. Is this cause of the tires or a different issue? Any advice is highly appreciated! Thanks everyone!

I just ordered the crush washers because at the very least, I’d like to add a quart into the fill and then warm up to 104-113 F and then pop the check plug off and make sure I’m not running with a low level of fluid. Maybe to buy me time? Or should I just order the gasket/filter kit and the ATF ASAP and do the job?

1oy1awz,Paid a mechanic to replace my battery. He got the wrong size and used a rock as a bracket. What now?,"My car wouldn’t start and none of the electrics were working. A friend helped me try to jump start it, but no luck. I suspected the battery, so I booked a diagnostic through ClickMechanic. They assigned a local guy who came out, ran some tests, and confirmed the battery was dead. He said he could replace it the same day, and I agreed.

A few hours later he came back with a new S4 018 Bosch battery (original one was Yuasa HSB056). He assured me it had the same specs, despite being a different brand (40Ah, 12V). He installed it, and then told me it was a “slightly different base size” from the old one. His solution was to wedge a rock between the battery and the bracket to keep it steady (first pic). He said he’d come back later with the proper bracket. I was uncomfortable but he seemed genuine, just not very professional. Unfortunately, I paid him in cash, which I now realize was a stupid mistake.

After he left, I texted asking when he’d return to fix it. His response: “Leave it as it is mate, it’s secure, not gonna move.” At that point I realized I might’ve just paid for a potentially unsafe botched job. I called him, demanded he sort it out, and he told me to drive to his garage.

When I got there, the “garage” was basically a messy shed full of scrap. He did remove the rock and installed some kind of bracket/attachment he found lying around (second pic). I wasn’t thrilled with it, but I also knew he wasn’t going to replace the battery for free, so I just left.


Now I’m wondering: do I need to pay someone else to install a whole new battery correctly, or are there proper brackets made for smaller-sized batteries that I can request?

If that isn't the case, does your car have a sunroof, because they can have crud blocking the drain holes that will result in water coming in where you don't want it.  

Next open the hood of the car and look at the plastic area near the bottom of the front windshield.

Been getting my shit kicked in this week and the cherry was my bronco dying on me. 

Background: ‘93 Ford Bronco xlt 5.8 V8 (it’s so sweet). Just put a new battery in (old one was corroded as hell) 

I was driving home late/early asf in the morning and a block away from my house, my car dies and loses pretty much all power to it. I coasted and made it to the middle of an intersection (residential) and was thankfully able to push it and park on the side of the road, out of the way (it’s basically in a parking spot now so not worried). I called a tow truck before I was able to get it out of the way, and cancelled it after I was successfully able to move it. I decided to cancel because I’d be paying $175 just to move it a block and park it infront of my house. I’d rather call later and be able to take it to a shop. Also this car is heavier than a mf gyat
 
Since I was only about a block away, I just walked home. will call a tow truck tomorrow and have it taken into a shop, my best guess is the alternator has gone to shit. I really have no idea, my guess is based on a quick google. If anyone has any advice at all please let me know. Thanks 🙏

I’ve never had to call a tow truck on it and am a young college kid. Just hoping this turns around and everything will be okay. Not completely sure what I’m asking of you guys, but I figured some words from strangers with an insight could be hopeful/encouraging. 




Also:
Don’t think this completely relates but I’ve been having some transmission problems recently as well. It’s an automatic (wish it was stick lol) but when I’m going up a hill and making it work, it has trouble shifting from 4-5th gear.

My 2009 Honda Fit Sport (180,000mi) has been going strong since I bought it 6 years ago, with no major issues up until a few months ago. Within 3 weeks these all happened in 3 separate events:

1. My whole wheel flew off my car while driving (possibly due to lug nuts not being tightened enough after a rotation 2 weeks prior) that caused damage to wheel well & suspension.

2. My clutch gave out and had to be replaced.

3. My car broke down and ended up needing a new fuel pump.

All in all this has cost me almost $3500. Each time I was thinking ""okay, it'll be good after this"" and then it just kept happening and I kept spending the money to fix it thinking it'd be good after. 

Now, just 2-3 months later my car suddenly started making a 'clunk' sound when I'd make a hard right or left turn. Took it to the shop and turns out I need a whole new front suspension. Control arms, struts, sway bar, alignment, etc. Additionally, the shop doesn't feel comfortable just doing that and want to fix a couple other structural integrity issues in that area where my wheel flew off the car. The shop owner said this is due to liability since I'm from out of town and on a long roadtrip. The estimate is $3-4k. 

I'm a 10hr drive from home and was in the middle of a 2 week roadtrip. Do I bite the bullet and pay up? Should I take it to another shop that would consider doing just the essential work instead? Or do I sell it real quick to CarMax or for scraps? I love my little guy to pieces and I'd be heartbroken, especially after already pouring so much money into it.

* It's a short, sharp rattle / grinding noise.
* I can make it happen by quickly tapping the gas pedal even in neutral, while the car is standing still.
* When driving, it can sometimes become longer and more continuous.
* It happens most often in 1st or 2nd gear, especially going uphill, but it's not limited to those conditions.
* Sometimes it barely does it, other times it does it constantly it's inconsistent and hard to reproduce on purpose.
* The noise gets louder with RPM, so it's clearly engine-speed related.
* Pressing the clutch does not make it disappear.
* When the noise first started, it was much quieter it has definitely gotten worse over time.

# Important background info:

* The engine itself runs very smoothly no misfires, no hesitation, no smoke.
* No check engine light.
* Timing belt and the top end all sound normal. (Timing was changed about 10k kms ago, the sound was present before that)

# What I’m trying to figure out:

* Could this be an input shaft bearing or another internal gearbox bearing?

1oxhqds,Bought a used car with a safety but Callipers are causing overheating on rotors,"Hi I live in Cambridge Ontario and recently purchased a used car from a private seller that came with a safety certificate. Safety was completed 1 day before I bought the car and after I drove it for 20-25 minutes and stopped I noticed a smell and significant heat coming from 2 of the brakes. 

Car came with a safety certificate which I thought meant the brakes are working and it safe condition. The callipers seizing or partially seizing enough to cause that much heat does not seem like “safe condition”. 

Question is what can be done? Do I call mechanic who issued safety and ask how this passed? Are callipers part of a safety inspection or just rotors and pads? Is the mechanic responsible for callipers during brake inspection? And is this something that should be reported if the safety was issued 1 day before this problem was noticed? 

Didn’t notice the issue on the short test drive but that much heat after only 20-25 minutes of driving makes me wonder how a mechanic wouldn’t notice the calliper isn’t functioning properly.

1oxggxy,2003 Subaru Impreza WRX 2.0 Turbo Overheating,"Been trying to chase down an overheating problem on my wife's car. The heat rises past operating temperature on gauge and sometimes goes back down on it's own. I can't say that it's been consistent with any particular driving condition. It happens on non-stop, stop and go, level and up / down hill. I was hoping to get some additional troubleshooting input. 

  
First, here is what I've done so far:

1. Replaced the radiator cap.
2. Tested for combustion gases in the coolant with liquid test kit. 
3. Replaced thermostat and gasket. Old coolant looked clean, and no evidence of corrosion or contamination I could see. Thermostat housing looked clean too.
4. Refilled and burped the coolant over a 20 minute period until the swirl tank stopped bubbling. I did run the interior heat to make sure that I also got the air bubbles out of the heater coil.
5. Used laser thermometer to measure the temp of the swirl tank, and several other hoses and hot locations where coolant ran. ODBII live data said temp got up to 230's. Laser gun maxed out at mid 190's when testing. When the car had been driven, and then allowed to cool partial, I saw a 20 degree difference. I wasn't sure if the temp difference was because of the exterior parts being able to cool faster than the temp sensor.
6. Verified the water pump isn't making any noises, and since it was able to burp the system, I think it's safe to assume it's working too.

With the coolant being so clean and the system able to be burped I wasn't inclined to think the radiator was clogged. I'm not sure if the laser gun test is useful or not, but the only thing I know I haven't tested or swapped is a coolant temp sensor. 

Is there something else I should try before continuing to throw parts at this???",1,1763175028.0,3,AskMechanics,1763321639,2025-11-15 02:50:28,2025-11-16 19:33:59,"HunterShotBear (Score: 1): How many miles?

1oxg04a,Is the connecting rod of a piston engine attached by its bearing to the main bearings on the crankpin?,"I’ve tried to find a good picture or website that explains it but every explanation I see make it seems like this would be the case, and yet it seems to be wrong? It also isn’t entirely clear to me why the connecting rod can’t just be mounted on the crankshaft by its bearings? ",1,1763173686.0,4,AskMechanics,1763321639,2025-11-15 02:28:06,2025-11-16 19:33:59,"ZX6Rob (Score: 3): The big end of a connecting rod splits into two pieces.  The bearing is a thin metal band that goes between the connecting rod and the part of the crankshaft where the rod is mounted, which is called a rod journal.  This rod journal and the bearing itself contain small passageways that allow oil to be forced through under pressure.

It seems at first glance like this would be a problem, as it looks like it would result in metal-on-metal movement.  But, in fact, the rod, bearing, and journal are all machined to tight tolerances so that, when oil is run through the engine, pressurized by the oil pump, it is forced through the small ports and creates a thin film between the bearing and the surface of the journal.  This makes it a “hydrodynamic” bearing — the big end of the rod and its bearing are essentially “floating” on this super-thin layer of oil, separating them from the journal.  That drastically reduces friction and allows the bearing and rod-end to turn easily on the journal.

The reason for the separate bearings (after all, if the oil is doing the work of removing the friction, what’s the point of this extra little shim of metal, right?) is pretty straightforward .  The bearing is made of much cheaper and softer material than your rod or crankshaft. As things wear down over time, the bearing can be thought of as a “sacrificial” part — it takes the beating that would otherwise accumulate on your rod and crankshaft, allowing you to reuse these more expensive, harder parts during repair or rebuilding.  The softer material also helps with absorbing contaminants from dirty oil or other bad stuff that might find its way into the system.

I don’t know, does any of that help to explain?  I don’t really have a better diagram, but hopefully this was a useful write-up.

1oy20we,What BMW would you recommend me?,"I’m 20 male from the UK, had my license for 3 years but never bought a car, I do have driving experience from driving abroad, delivery jobs etc.

Yes I know BMW is not the ideal first car but I  I’ve done a lot of research and I’m happy with the consequences, if I do it right, I can spend max of £1k a year on maintenance or less.

I gathered that when looking for a BMW which will do me good as much as possible I should:

1. Look into B47/B58 engines, which come post 2015 models I believe, they have lowest chance of timing chain issues which is common with N engines.
2. Ensure they have full service history which is very important in a BMW
3. I am going to buy a diesel, so I heard these last up to 200k anyway, so mileage won’t
Matter as long as it has FSH and good servicing.
4. Very important to ensure it has been oil changed every 10k miles 
5. I know 6 cyl is smoother but I’ll stick to 4 for insurance purposes 

My only requirements are:

1. I need a diesel, I’ll be doing a ton of motorway journeys, possibly 40-50 mile journeys at one go, so about 80-100 per day 2/3 times a week.
2. I don’t plan to keep the car for long, perhaps 2 years so I’d love to easily resell this (yes I’m down to maintain the full service history) 
3. I don’t care about engine size, I don’t even care about how fast it goes, just want a nice nice car to get me from a to b and drive about for fun 
4. 4 door would be very ideal!
5. Not really into hatchbacks, unless It’s really beneficial for me to have one for my use cases.
6. Budget, I can spend up to £10k if I REALLY must, but the lower the more ideal ofc.

Please let me know what I should go for! I love BMW cars and I think I can finally afford one so I’d love to treat myself. ",1,1763238510.0,22,CartalkUK,1763321639,2025-11-15 20:28:30,2025-11-16 19:33:59,"just-the-Gasman (Score: 6): Find post 2015 320d

DPF blocking up can be an issue and is usually caused by the fuel vaporiser in the exhaust blocking up, with carbon deposits, so that it can't spray diesel in to the exhaust to increase the temperature to 600°C+ to regen the dpf. Signs of this happening would be an amber warning appearing on the dash, it doesn't tell you what it is do you need to read the error codes. It goes away if you turn the car off and on again but if left then the warning would change to red and the car would go in to limp mode. As I said the failed regen is due to a failed vaporiser...replace that and it should regen and unblock the dpf. It's rare to need to replace the dpf, if you do get a Ford one (expensive) as aftermarket ones don't seem to be so good and they cause more frequent regens which of course uses more fuel.

Then the mechanical (High Pressure) fuel pump.

On a petrol it's normally driven by the backside of the cam. Never changed one so not sure the cost or labour but think it'd be pricey. Not TDI pricey, but the part itself isn't cheap. I'm not aware of any modern VAG petrol \*not\* being direct injection but they *may* be a chance yours isn't direct. I don't know every single engine they have.

On a diesel though it will be direct injection, and it'll be driven by the timing belt. I've (not a mechanic) changed a few of these. So it's pretty much a timing belt job plus changing the fuel pump while you're there. It's around £300-£400 and several hours at a garage for a timing belt (and the wp etc) plus whatever the mechanical high pressure pump costs.

They have also offered £1.5k to buy the car off him. The car is not well looked after, has not had a service in years, which has definitely contributed to this issue. 

After talking to his father, they are unwilling to believe it will be over £2k, they are not at all knowledgeable about cars. Both myself and my dad, who re-build cars in our spare time, have advised the most likely outcome is the engine has failed and will need stripping/replacing, and maybe a new fuel pump. 

They have no money. They have just bought a house that needs a lot of work, have a baby on the way, and the cars owner has just lost his job. They are hesitant to take the £1.5k as this will be the only money they have to buy a car. I don’t mind helping them look for a decent car and working on it for them but they are not keen. 

What would you do in this situation? I would take the £1.5k and run, since the cars only work max £3k in working order. ",1,1763213411.0,14,CartalkUK,1763321639,2025-11-15 13:30:11,2025-11-16 19:33:59,"Lewinator56 (Score: 8): Snapped belt means wrecked engine.

I recently have moved to the UK from the San Francisco Bay Area on a spousal visa with me and my partner. I’m a pretty long time car enthusiast having owned so far: 2 Rx7’s, 2 GTI’s, a Forester XT, a Duramax, a CBR motorcycle, and an Old Ford pick up truck. I do regular track days and auto cross and don’t want to go too long without having something fun in the UK, but I’m also cognisant of financial costs as a newer driver, especially in regards to insurance. My company from the Bay Area looks poised to start me in our London office on ~£150k and my partner makes £45k so finances aren’t super tight but I also don’t want to be irresponsible. 

My budget is around £10-15k cash for something off of marketplace and I would prefer to keep insurance under £350 a month. My highest priorities in order are are something fun, something at least somewhat reliable, something I can street park if I need to, something I can do occasional track days with, probably want more space than an s2000 or a Miata, and something ULEZ compliant thought not a deal breaker. 

Cars I have been considering are:

1. Fiesta ST: though they seem like theft magnets
2. Altezza rs200: not ULEZ compliant and a JDM import
3. Accord Euro R: same issue as the Altezza
4. R32 MK5 Golf: emotional choice as we never got the manual version in the US, but likely expensive on insurance and unreliable
5. GT86: fun track car, limited on space
6. NC mx5: prefer to GT86 but would only get the soft top to install a roll bar and I don’t want to street park a soft top, plus limited on space
7. Ep3 type R: not ULEZ compliant
8. s2000: I have no idea why they are so affordable in the UK, but I love these cars, pure emotional decision though.
9. MK6 golf gti: familiar to me as I have owned two mk7’s
10. Polo GTI: never got these in the US but the seem cool, like more raw and focused golf gti’s

I was wondering if anyone had any tips or experience on taking a finance company to small claims court.

Cut a long story short, I was sold a brand new faulty vehicle since seven days into my purchase last year the vehicle constantly displays a “please engage into gear message” and will not move. I’ve had numerous breakdowns call outs, the cars had to be recovered several times and the car is so temperamental that sometimes it will switch back on after 10 mins sometimes it won’t switch back on for 2 hours.

When I first put in a complaint I was told by the dealership and manufacturer that I would need to refer my complaint to the motor ombudsman which I did. I then also complained to the finance company who told me to go the financial ombudsman. The finance company offered me £500 good will gesture which I declined.

10 months later my complaint was upheld by the motor ombudsman and they deemed the vehicle to not be in sold in satisfactory condition. However they said they would not be able to compensate me other than to uphold the £500 goodwill gesture from the finance company and suggested I got to the financial ombudsman which I did but they have told me they will not take on my case as it was investigated already by the motor ombudsman.

I have since now filed a claim through MCOL and the finance company is defending it and they have hired solicitors. I know my case is strong and I have a lot of video photo evidence along with the the motor ombudsman deeming the vehicle was not sold to me in satisfactory condition but I am still so petrified on if my case is strong enough. I am claiming for a full refund for the deposit I paid, monthly payments made for the last year & have explained that I am willing to pay the cost of the mileage fee as I have gone over the 5000 per annum limit due to my job and caring responsibilities.

So, yesterday I took my 2012 Vauxhall Ampera in to have an error code removed after replacing a part (OBDII readers were unable to erase it) so decided to take the hit and get the main dealer (Pentagon Burton on trent) to sort it, as the car is going up for sale soon.

3 hours waiting and they've finally done it, hand my keys back and... wait a second - (here's issue #1) the unlock button on my keyfob is completely missing!

Okay, so it's a 13 year old car and the fob was worn but the button was attached. I went back inside and asked them to help sort it, and basically they said because of the age I had to accept it was going to happen sooner or later and that I could get a replacement case for a tenner off ebay. I'm running out of time, so I agree and head home. They refunded a tenner from the diagnostic I just paid for. 

So I get home, aggravated I now have to sort the key fob out, put the car in reverse and (and here's issue #2) discover the rear view camera isn't working either. 

I've had this car over ten years with barely a single fault and since taking it to get one thing fixed I come back with two. 

I called them and told them, but how do I trust them to not blame me for the camera fault being there already and charging me another £150? 

I've got an awful feeling that unless there is irrefutable evidence it was their mistake, then they'll attribute it to me or my car being old!

As for fitting, its not overly hard but can be a bit fiddly, to make it look neat without having cables everywhere. Not sure I would trust Halfords as most people I know have had bad experiences with their 'specialists' even for something as trivial as a dash cam fitting.

Also if you are getting a front and rear camera, 32GB SD card is way too small, especially if you want to record at a higher res or framerate which will fill it up very quickly. Ideally you want a 128GB one.
