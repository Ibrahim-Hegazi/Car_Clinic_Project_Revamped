1n1wzl0,Help needed for 2018 Dodge Journey SE,Hello all. As mentioned above I've run into problems with my 2018 Dodge Journey SE. one day I went to leave in it and it would no longer start. The engine did not even try to turn over and the vehicle had full power everywhere. My brother stated the battery may have juice but not enough to start the engine. So I went through the painstaking task of removing the battery so he could charge it for me at work. Got the battery back amd installed it along with replacing the positive battery terminal as it was super rusted and corroded and thought even that might be the issue. This did not work. Replaced with a brand new battery and still nothing. Tried starting in neutral and nothing. Tried the 5 pushes on the push start then try to start it. Did not work. Checked all associated fuses were not burnt out. Even checked if the starter relay was the issue by replacing it with one of the radiator fan ones that are identical and nothing still. Wanted to try the same with the ignition relay in the cabin but no other relays match that one to try and see if that one was out. One thing I notice is when I push the start button and all gauges and lights light up there is a loud click that comes from where the ignition relay is located in the cabin. I then return to off position and hear a repeated clicking noise from the engine bay. Just trying to see if anyone has any other suggestions before I either try to replace the starter or depending on if I dont have time just tow it to a mechanic.

In the last couple weeks, all the spark plugs were changed, ignition coil for cylinder 6, checked fuel injectors and switched from one to another to see if it triggers other cylinder but still the same. Proceeded to change the lifters and rocket arms on that side to see if that would help and camshaft looked good. Last night we ran a combustion test and checked for leaks but everything was fine. Switched a bunch of the spark plugs to different positions before putting back on so when check engine came on again we can see if it triggers a different cylinder or not.

1n1wi9a,How do we properly bleed clutch fluid to remove ALL air from the system?,"Hi guys, I guess this is a pretty redundant question as there's a million different answers out there, but I'm looking to know specifically why my method doesn't work, and what a solution is.

I just did a master cylinder change on my old 1997 3000GT, and when it came to refilling the clutch fluid, I had one man on the clutch pedal, another man (me) continuously pouring fluid in the reservoir, and another man collecting dot4 out the bleed nipple through a clear hose into an empty bottle.

I would keep pouring whilst the clutch-pumper would keep pumping, until the guy checking the contents on the hose coming out of the bleed nipple saw that there were no air pockets coming out any more, just fluid. DURING the clutch bleeding process, the clutch felt heavy and normal to the press. But, after we finished and filled the reservoir to max and tried pressing on the clutch, it felt all wrong, like there was definitely air in the system - it was ridiculously light for about 10cm then rock hard and solid, like it couldn't be pushed down any further prematurely.

So, what's the correct method to do this? I thought this was the right method, to effectively push out all the air present in the system. Thanks guys, hoping I can learn something soon",0,1756336954.0,9,MechanicAdvice,1756409691,2025-08-27 23:22:34,2025-08-28 19:34:51,"SantosHauper (Score: 3): I had a hell of a time doing it on my Honda, even with a vacuum bleeder.

abbarach (Score: 3): You can ""reverse bleed""; get a large syringe and done tubing. Fill the syringe, use it to fill the tubing and then connect it to the bleed nipple.  Open the bleeder and use the syringe to force fluid from the slave up to the master. 

It's done on motorcycles sometimes; the problem you can run into is that the lines all run downhill, so air tries to rise back up the line while you're bleeding.  Reverse bleeding will push them up to the reservoir.

The other trick I've used with motorcycles is to zip-tie the lever to the handlebars (holding the brake fully applied). It will leave the path open, and let any bubbles collect and flow up.  Leave it like that overnight, and check the next morning to see if it feels normal.  You might be able to do similar if you can jam the clutch pedal down.

Just to check, did you bench-bleed the slave cylinder before you installed it?"

I have looked EVERYWHERE and no one seems to have an answer but maybe I’m not explaining it well enough for someone to know what it is. 

Things that I’ve considered being the problem, I’m not a mechanic so maybe some of these things are stupid to consider but I genuinely have no idea what I’m talking about: 

1. A bad clutch, I know my clutch is on its way out because of a burnt smell occasionally. I know how to drive a manual and never ride my clutch so I believe the person I bought it from probably didn’t change it for a really long time, or destroyed it with bad driving. 

2. An exhaust leak, this one I’ve considered very heavily and I believe I have a very minor exhaust leak on the right side right in front of the catalytic converter. 

3. Spark plugs? I’ve thought of this but my car isn’t sending any codes, and I’ve changed all the spark plugs before because I had an instance of one blowing out shortly after I got the car. 

4: sometimes it sounds like something is kinda clogged. Like could something be clogged in my exhaust causing it to make this noise?

1n1vz6p,Smell from alternator,"Hey all, I imagine this question has been asked before but I can't find examples that seem comparable to my old car. I drive a 1992 Toyota Camry, about a year ago I was advised by my shop that my alternator had gone out (battery light on, fully dead) while it was with them. They replaced it with a reman unit at the time, and told me that they had had trouble finding one for my vehicle due to its age at that time. 
Fast forward to today, I'd been noticing a weird smell intermittently for a few days but assumed it was someone else's vehicle (stupid I know). Twice in the past week I had no electrical power when going to start my car, one I assumed was the battery due to the car having sat for awhile, and the other time I had left my headlights on overnight (again, stupid). Today I was driving and keeping an eye on the voltmeter I have hardwired into my car and watched it drop from 14v down to 12.1, and that smell got stronger. I've traced smell to the alternator, it's not like a burning smell but it's kinda in the same family of smells if that makes sense? Voltage only seems to drop when the car's in neutral. Haven't tested with the multimeter yet but tested the system at AutoZone and that test confirmed the alternator is going bad. 
I work about 20 minutes drive from home (at an AutoZone actually), and my shop told me they can't get me in until another 5-6 days.

I was stopped at a red light for a bit on completely flat ground, and the car in front of me started to reverse very quickly into my car. Too fast for me to switch gears or even honk.

But my car (which I’ve only had for 8 months and is 2015 Chevy if that helps) started rolling backwards??? Slow enough to not hit the car behind me, but just fast enough to get out of the way.

Im able to put my hand on starter and get somebody else to turn key in ignition, and I can feel the thud is coming from the starter.

It might be a defective starter motor, it could be a locked-up engine, probably not a problem with the flex plate though.  Usually when a flex plate fails it cracks in the middle around where it bolts to the crankshaft so that when you hit the starter motor the flex plate will turn (or at least try to) but the engine itself won't.

My recommendation would be to get yourself a large 1/2"" drive ratchet, a socket (I think you need a 21mm but I won't swear to it), possibly a socket extension, and make sure that the engine itself isn't locked up.  Easiest way to do this is to set the ratchet to tighten and use the bolt in the middle of the crank pulley to see if the engine spins over.  If you can get the engine through 2 complete revolutions you'll know that it isn't seized.

Assuming the engine isn't seized, and you have good connections at the starter motor, you can try doing a voltage drop test on the power wire for the starter motor to see how much voltage is being lost between the battery and the starter motor.  Ford specifies no more than 0.5v, or at least that's what I was taught when I was sent to Ford's basic electrical factory training course.  Here's a video on how to do a voltage drop test. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPpHRuddhh4

If you're not dropping an excessive amount of voltage and have good connections, and the engine isn't seized, the next step I'd take if I was in your position would be to ""embrace the suck"", pull the starter motor back off and bench-test it.  If you don't have jumper cables to use to test the starter on an actual workbench, you can unbolt it from the engine and hold it in your hand while the wires are still connected and have someone else crank the engine for you.  If you use this method, PLEASE make sure to keep your fingers far away from the moving parts.  They'll chew your fingers up right quick and I don't want to be responsible for you to have to get medical attention on your hands."

Modern car alternators (really since the 80's) are **capable of charging even when idling**...

also, batteries do not like charging too fast, so there's little difference in charge speed/amount when going faster, iirc most batteries will charge like 7A per hour... regardless of how much it turns... but of course, it will take **hours** to charge fully if the battery is dead...

tips: use the car more... and/or let it idle for 30 min every 3 days you don't use the car.

ps: a battery that goes flat even once is a battery with it's days counted... if you get stranded again of just ""feel"" it cranking slower, get a new battery"
1n1v2zy,Alternator or possibly voltage regulator.,"My wife has a 2009 pontiac G6 base. She says she's getting the rotten eggs smell in her car. I changed her alternator many a few years ago and the battery as well. I ran a test with my scanner this morning. It said the battery and alternator were both fine.

So my biggest questions now are. 
What test should I do next? Does her car have an external voltage regulator or is it inside the alternator? Is it possible that the scan this morning passed because the engine was cold?

I figured while going through the cooling system I may as well do a coolant flush so I'm  in the middle of that. Currently just have distilled water in the loop.

1n1txdj,Car will not move after complete front end work,"Hello, 2010 Nissan Rogue

I am relatively new at working on my cars. This was my first dive into front end work. I took my time and acquired the right tools and the job went pretty well.

Front left was missing sway bar link- tie rods were bad, ball joint was bad.

I replaced all front end components. When I was doing the left side the axle popped out. I eventually got it back in. 

When I got everything back together, the car would not move. It feels like one side is locking up the brakes? 

I put it in reverse and drive, the car would want to move but the it felt like something was binding it up.

When on jack stands and in drive the front wheels will move when I let off the brake as soon as I give any power the wheels lock up. And engine revs high. I replaced axles in an attempt to fix this as well. As I had popped out the front left axle when doing my first control arm.

There were some pretty nasty noises when shifting between gears before beginning this project.

Recently did transmission fluid and filters.

Any help is appreciated I would like to know what I could've done wrong or where to check. I can supply videos or pictures. I'm about to call the shop. I'm at my wits end because I did not expect to have this problem. I was more focused on doing the front end when I started all this.

Thank you

1n1rvsq,Oil leak or something more?,"2006 Chrysler Sebring 2.7L V6 90,000miles


My oil pressure light on my Sebring was coming on only at idle/redlights/drive thru, when I drive (rpms go up) the light would disappear.

I figured this may be a dirty oil filter or perhaps low oil levels. I went and got an oil change and the problem immediately persisted. Side note - I have known that I have been slowly leaking oil for almost 8 months but this is a new issue.

So, Oil levels are fine, just had a new oil filter installed and still problems, off to the mechanic I go. I just got a call from them saying they found 3 leaks. Oil pan, valve gasket, and near the oil sensor. They are saying $1275 to repair the leaks.

The thing that I am wondering is if the oil is slowly leaking, would this still cause my engines oil pressure to only be low at idle? The internet tells me it could be a bad oil pump, which would equal (another recent) big repair. I might be a little jaded because after bringing this vehicle in for a new water pump at a different shop, I had to go back 3x just to get them to solve problems that didn’t exist before. I ended up leaving with a new check engine light and a remaining oil leak.

TL;DR - will a slow oil leak, with visibly fine oil levels and a clean filter result in an oil pressure light being only on at idle? Or is it something more nefarious.

1n1igok,My experience as the owner of a seven speed 2017 Hyundai Tucson,"Hey, just need to vent about my car troubles. Nothing you haven't already seen.

I’ve got a 2017 Hyundai Tucson that has basically been trying to ruin my life. I got it brand new back in 2017. Oil changes every 10,000 kms (or 6,000 miles for you burger lovers). It's on 111,000 kms now (around 69,000 miles).

Here’s the highlight reel:

Transmission failure → had to replace it earlier this year because it kept stuttering and losing power. Eventually it went into limp mode. Had to get one of the actuators fixed along with both clutches. That already cost me around 2000 dollars. 


Steering squeak → months of annoying squeaking from the column, mechanic suspected “cross bar” issue, but I ignored it because… well, broke after the transmission. But obviously, that came with a cost. Started getting sarks under steering column. Eventually, while reversing, the steering wheel popped, sparks flew, and boom — power steering gone. EPS light lit a long with a bunch of others. 

Final diagnosis: Broken instrument panel crossmember plus broken EPS.
Mechanic replaced:

EPS brain/module

Cross bar (dashboard support beam)

Multi fuse

So yeah, I’m now the proud owner of a Tucson with a new transmission and a refreshed EPS system but also a bank account that looks like a war zone.

At this point I’m wondering if I should just cut my losses and sell, or stick with it since the two biggest failure points (transmission + steering) are “fixed.”. So far the damn thing's set me back around 3500 dollars in the span of two months. Pretty brutal.

1n1venr,Need advise on my 2016 Hyundai Santa Fe Ltd Ultimate,"I have a 2016 Hyundai Santa Fe Ltd Ultimate (AWD) with 142,000 miles on it. For the past 3 months or so, when I'm already going 35-40mph or more, and I gently accelerate...for example, on a 55mph road, slowing down for an upcoming light that turns green when I'm slowed down 5-10mph & then slowly accelerate back up to 55mph, or pass a car on a 4 lane highway, or the speed limit goes from 45 to 60...there's a noise that sounds like it's coming from either the back tires or back end of the car, it's a rhythmic baboop baboop, as though I'm riding over evenly spaced lines on the road...only I'm not. The noise stops as soon as I'm up to speed & no longer accelerating. I'm not accelerating quickly, or blowing cars off the road passing them, it's slow, steady acceleration.Tbh sometimes I'm not positive it's coming from the back end or more in the middle.

 I also have had a problem for the last 18 months or so, when I make a turn the back tires feel and sound like parts of the tire are momentarily repeatedly losing their grip on the road all through the turn. Bumpbumpbumpbumpbumpbump all the way around the corner. Fast or slow. It's not every single turn, but most. And gets progressively worse throughout the day. If I turn very slowly & gingerly w my foot off the gas (not always possible)  I can sometimes keep it from happening. I do home visits, we cover 5 counties. I drive for work averaging about 50-75 miles a day. Some days more like 125+. By the middle of the day it's every single turn whether around a corner, or in a parking lot. New tires didn't take care of the problem. My kid suggested maybe the differential. The Hyundai dealership checked it out and did work on the swaybars about a year ago & it helped 99% but slowly got bad again. I did recently have the differential fluid changed, that didn't help. 

I'm worried that the noise the car is making during acceleration is something that's making the car unsafe to drive. All I've heard is ""unable to duplicate customer complaint."" Then they need to keep on driving til things are good & warmed up. But now I'm furious. I went back to the Hyundai dealership & the service advisor says ""sounds like it's the transmission & that's going to run $400 to diagnose & $3500-4500 for a new transmission. With 142k miles on it, wouldn't it be more cost effective to buy a new car?"" I'm no mechanic, but I'm no idiot & this isn't my 1st car. It isn't showing any signs/symptoms of transmission problems. He also said it could be the transfer case since I have AWD. The AWD is not full-time & has to be manually turned on, and it's only been used 3-4 times for very short periods climbing slippery hills in winter. My manual says the AWD ""falls off"" at 30-40 mph when it is engaged. So I don't use it, except in dicey situations. Does the transfer case sound right? Then I was introduced to a salesman who tried to sell me a Kona. I know dealerships do this underhanded crap, and I only took it there because my regular shop said, when I asked them about checking the differential, ""We don't have the machine needed to check a differential, the nearest one is in Chicago."" (90 miles away) I thought well that doesn't sound right! I don't know if mechanics see a 64 yr old woman & think I don't know what I'm talking about, am just nuts, or what. I'm not. Idiot salesman thinks he's talked me into buying a new car 😆😂🤣🤣🤣. I will not be taking the car to the dealership again.

Does anyone have any idea what could be making that thump thump noise when I accelerate? It doesn't do it when I'm accelerating from a dead stop, only after I hit around 35mph or so. It isn't loud like a broken strut, but it's there. It stops when I let off the accelerator.  I am concerned about the safety of this vehicle. It's been a good car since I've had it, (3yrs/45k miles), no issues.

1n1sks2,Why would a car be shaking after replacing the rear differential?,"

It's a 2019 Kia Sorento 

It all started when we were having a grinding noise in one of the rear tires. There was no other problems though, no other symptoms. Brakes were working just fine. 

But the grinding noise kept getting worse. We got so nervous we finally took it to a shop. Shops at the pads and rotors were bad. Paid almost a thousand to get all of them replaced. 

About 4 days after taking the car back from the shop, it just stopped in the middle of the road. Engine was running. It was acting like it should work, it just wouldn't move. 

Had a toad back to the same shop assuming they must have done something wrong with the brakes. They claim to have a warranty on their work. But after looking at it they told us there was a catastrophic crack in the rear differential. Said it would cost $3,700 to fix. 

Then we remembered the car was still under warranty. 

There was a lot of annoying back and forth between us and the shop and the warranty people. The shop was rude and made my mom cry a few times over the phone. But eventually we got the warranties approval for the work. 

Just picked it up today. Warranty covered most of it, we had a $300 deductible, and there was $200 more on top of that which wasn't covered by warranty. 

About an hour after picking it up, my mom texted me to tell me that's shaking bad every time she brakes. 

So what do we do? Do we go back to the same shop we're kind of mean to us and might not have done it right in the first place? If the shop did something wrong, would warranty still covered after they've already paid for it? Will the warranty people let us go to a different shop? Is it normal to shake?

1n19ou9,Starting to think that someone might have fed the gremlins in my electrical system after midnight. Can't find the source of drain on the battery and running out of tests to track it down.,"Trying to figure out why the battery doesn't want to stay charged for more than 36 hours in a 2007 Scion tC with 92k miles.

There doesn't seem to be any indications in the car itself, such as lights flickering or anything. The behavior of everything else has been normal.

I've been removing the negative battery connection every time it gets parked. After reconnecting it and starting the car, it turns on normally but quickly turns off, but the second time it turns on it behaves 100% normally. I've read that this isn't unusual in some Toyota models as the car computer has to relearn some information on the throttle and idle.

If it does die, placing a Dewalt charge pack on it will instantly allow it to crank on. No slow crank or lag with the ignition or anything.

The battery has been tested at two auto parts places, as well as at Interstate Battery where it was purchased. It's not a faulty battery.

The alternator showed 13.4-13.6 volts at the battery with the car running, which is within normal range on Toyotas. Despite that, and despite the fact that it was replaced 5k miles ago, I pulled it out of the car and took it to a local spot that rebuilds them and had it bench tested. They said there was no issue in it.

The serpentine belt is properly tight, no slipping.

Testing the amps across the negative terminal post and negative cable connector showed a draw of .025 amps, again in the normal range and not indicative of anything taking too much power.

Testing the voltage across the tops of every fuse in the car with the battery hooked back up showed only one 7.5 amp fuse measuring anything at all, and it was 0.1 volts, which converted to mA using a conversion chart is also not enough to drain the battery. I took measurements repeatedly over the course of like 45 minutes just waiting for one to begin spiking and none ever did.

Checking voltage drop across the positive terminal and the output stud of the alternator with the car running and every component turned on showed 0.186 volts, which I believe is supposed to be under 0.250, so all good there.

Checking voltage drop across the negative terminal and the case of the alternator showed .057 volts, which I don't know the threshold, but was told the number is also within the normal range.

Due to the behavior of the car, I don't think it is an issue involving the starter.

And now I don't know what to test anymore.

The only thing I can think of is, instead of checking for voltage drop between the terminal posts and the alternator, I need to do the same test again and have the lead touching the terminal connector instead. Is this a decent idea?

Or what other tests should I try out next?",1,1756276495.0,7,autorepair,1756409691,2025-08-27 06:34:55,2025-08-28 19:34:51,"GregHimself (Score: 1): If you have access to another known good battery I would swap one in to test that issue, I've had batteries test good on the digital testers but still be bad.

I have a 2006 Toyota Sequoia V8 RWD. I have had this car for many years and have had many memories made with it. Bought it as second hand with around 100k~ miles on it. Currently it has around 140k~ miles. I’ve had one minor crash in it that struck the front drivers-side headlight corner and bent the wheel joint idk but the engine was fine, drove it home on a spare. 

Anyways,
I get my oil changed at valvoline and haven’t noticed anything of concern for years until the last few times i’ve been. My car uses synthetic 5W-30 oil and the price of a change is one thing that I’ve accepted but recently the sticker mileage for the next change has dropped off significantly. I feel like the oil is supposed to be good for around 5000 miles but the last two stickers I’ve gotten from there have been for 3000 miles till next change.

1n1n30x,Ever had a cursed car?,"2010 BMW E61 535i Touring.  Customer's car.  This POS has become the bane of my existence!!  It has had all the usual BMW crap in the last few years.  Oil filter housing gaskets.  Valve cover.  The usual suspension items.

Then came the radio reception issues. Ended up replacing the left side tailgate harness with the repair harness from BMW.  Told the customer it would be a good idea to do the right side as well while we're in there.  Customer declined.  Did the left side repair harness.  Everything OK.   

The current service started with the AC not blowing cold from the left dash, and the auto tailgate wouldn't open.  

Try the tailgate, latch releases normally, but the hydraulic motor to lift it cuts out immediately.  Move the panel and insulation to get the the hydraulic pump.  It's been leaking, the reservoir is near empty, and someone had put a hole in the side of the reservoir to refill it and then tried to plug it with a machine screw!!  If you know these pumps, you're supposed to take the pump out of where it mounts and turn it upside-down to fill it from the fill plug in the top (or bottom?) of the reservoir.   Sourced and put in a used pump. Tailgate works just fine.

AC issue: Fault set for the left water valve.  I told them 95 times out of 100, it's a failed water valve solenoid.  To know for sure I need time to diagnose it and get it right.  They opted to just replace the valve.  Get that done, nope!  Same problem, same code.  Now I get to do diag.  Direct power the valve, works fine.  Test for power from the IHKA, nothing.  Get into the dash and test at the IHKA, sure enough, no power output on that pin.  Needs the IHKA.  Put on in and code and program.  AC working fine!

Then it had to go for state safety inspection.  Failed.  3rd brake light not working.  It was when I did the check when the car first came in this visit!!!  Wtf!?!?  Pull off the spoiler and test power and ground at the brake light connector.  Ground ok.  No power.  Drop the right rear  corner of the headliner to get to the noise suppressor.  Power going in.  Power coming out.  Test the line from the suppressor connector to the light connector.  No continuity!!  Another broken wire in the tailgate harness on the side they declined to have repaired.  I end up running a new wire through just to get them to pass safety.  3rd brake light works!

Coming back from the inspection station, take off from a stop light and at about 950rpm the CID goes blank, the every warning light on the dash comes on, transmission malfunction warning, gearshift malfunction warning, car goes into limp mode.  Nurse it back to the shop and as soon as I come to a stop, everything goes back to normal, except for some MILs still on.  Get in and check things out.  Alternator failed and started overcharging everything.  17.9V at idle!   So now I get to do that.   

I looked over all the work I've done and can't find anything wrong that would cause this kind of issue.

1n1l5qa,New codes after head gasket replacement,"Good Morning.
I just finished replacing a head gasket on my wife’s 2013 Prius (1.8l) and everything seems like it went great! I just about had the car together and decided I wanted to clean the MAP sensor, but the bolt was seized and I snapped the head off trying to take it off. I thought “well, it will still run.” I finished putting everything together, added oil and coolant, and put the car into maintenance mode. It ran for about a minute before stalling, and it didn’t sound like it was misfiring. I had my scanner hooked up and it populated the following codes

P0107 - MAP Sensor Circuit low
P0351 - Ignition Coil A Primary Control Circuit Open
P0352 - Ignition Coil B Primary Control Circuit Open
P0353 - Ignition Coil C Primary Control Circuit Open
P0354 - Ignition Coil D Primary Control Circuit Open
P3190 - Poor Engine Power

Keeping in mind, the ignition coils are practically brand new, only about 3 months old with no more than 150 miles on them.

Obviously it sucks going through a big repair and seeing MORE codes populate (although to was nice to not see the miss fire code)

I read that an issue with the MAP can cause the rest of the codes I’m seeing to populate, and was wondering if the snapped bolt could be effecting the MAP sensors ability to read pressure?

Any thoughts on the codes above, and how I can further diagnose and fix the issue?

So i purchased the car about 8 months ago for 1k. Runs smooth, good speed, and great sound without putting new speakers in lol. Like i said the car runs great and looks good just a few interior cosmetics. 

But the exterior issues:

1st problem
3rd cylinder misfire (known when purchased said he replaced the spark plug and coil packs so i rechecked after purchase and that was the only code that appeared with autozone print out)

2nd Problem
While driving say if i am going in between 40-55mph and i let up off the gas, coast a bit, then hit the gas slightly just to maintain the speed the tires seem like they shake (seem in good condition) but sounds like struts are bad or some very confusing. Cause i can also hear it every once in a while by jump pushing and pulling on the front end of the car. **this up nd down thing is like when i drove that day and its a super hot day** central texas btw**
To also include at other speeds it doesnt do it or its barely noticeable thats why its confusing

Okay so on to now

Problem 3 (fixed)
Right at about 2 months ago. Riding down hwy 35 from work i loose radio power first and car was still pushing but seemed different so i looked down and all power gone so i pull over cut the car off and nothing. A great guy that helped people on the rode side ran the scanner and jumped the battery but car wouldnt stay on so left the car for 2 days came back jumped it for about 1hr 1/2 with cables connected and it ran no issues for a good 2wks then it did it again. Went tested the battery and charged it..hook it back up and started right up took the negative cable off and car shut off. So w/ a buddy help we removed the alternator and got it tested..it was bad..Got another one from the junk yard and got lucky cause the car we got it from nobody touched it yet and the front end was clean from damages.
Installed and it ran..

4th problem:
Even tho it ran, unfortunately not paying attention battery was installed backwards and it was at night and not the best lighting and now blew the battery cable assembly. So now i replaced that assembly, checked all the plugs and bolt connections and still no crank.

I get power to the cabin except the radio. I can hear the fuel pump and the click i think of the starter being engaged just no turn over

1n17qmz,92 Mustang won't start (no fuel out of injectors?) Need help torubleshooting!,"Hey everyone, I recently bought a car with a custom 1992 mustang engine with an EFI system installed. I took it for a long drive one day and it was hot out. Temps got hot but didnt overheat, didnt sound weird, drove perfectly fine. Shut it off and started it multiple times that day without issue even when it was cooler and temps ad gone down. The next it refuses to start. This was maybe the 3rd time I've drove the car (brand new purchase for me) and now I can't get it to start even after all the troubleshooting, so its getting frustrating.

Ive checked:
1.) Fuses - all good
2.) Gas - added gas
3.) Engine ground - good
4.) Spark - good
5.) Fuel pressure - 40 PSI 
6.) Injector wires - 12V constant with key on, intermittent grounding when cranking (appeared 1-2V on my multimeter when cranking)
7.) Injector itself - clicks when 12V applied
8.) Plugs - not fouled, also not wet at all after cranking
9.) MAF sensor - cleaned
10.) Oil - normal, not milky or anything
11.) Tried spraying some starting fluid into the TB but the plenum is so big I dont think it helped. It didnt even give me a pop.
12.) Put a rolled up paper towel into sparkplug hole #1 and cranked. Completely dry and compression also blew it out of the hole

-- I am going to reach out to the seller to see if they installed an inertia switch, but its my understanding that if he did, it would shut off the fuel pump, and i have 40 PSI at my fuel rail

The car cranks very easily and fast. 
The last thing in my list to check is the throttle position sensor. I read if its reading high voltage 4V+ its reading as WOT and is in the ""clear flood"" circuit so it doesnt let injectors fire... which is weird because I see injectors are getting intermittent ground, unless its just not enough voltage (saw 1-2V fluctuating on my multimeter, could also just be fluctuating too fast for my meter to accurately read)
Also could be clogged fuel line? Just would be toooo coincidental that it happened after I parked it at my house for the night.

I am pretty sure that engine is direct injection so carbon on the intake valves is a possibility. Carbon build up prevents proper air flow. If the exhaust holes are too close to the O2 sensors it is possible they are reading wrong due to fresh air intake, or even got fouled and require replacement. It is possible the injectors are bad or installed wrong but all of them is odd. Unless they got the injectors for a 3.6 as they look similar and might even fit but have a different part number and could flow more fuel per pulse confusing the ECM. Theres other less likely things too, and vacuum leaks would be lean but expecting air from say the PCV or something and not getting it could cause this."

Chumsicle (Score: 4): Millions of Volkswagen Beetles and Karmann Ghias agree.

Dragonov02 (Score: 3): The water temp is the temperature of your engine coolant/antifreeze. It is circulated through the engine whenever it os running via the water pump.

As the temperature rises from the engine running the temp should go from cold to the normal zone, once it reaches a certain temp the engine coolant thermostat should open and begin circulating through the radiator; also the radiator fan will turn on at a certain temp though that depends on the vehicle how exactly that works.

If the coolant thermostat fails it should fail open and the engine will over cool preventing it from reaching operating temp, this is not great for long term operation but it'll get you were you need to go until you can fix it. 

If the engine has trouble cooling or is working too hard it could overheat, this can cause the system to overpressure and vent/boil off. The engine must be given a break from hard work but ideally left running to prevent hotspots, or if the engine isn't cooling at all then it should be turned off and be left to cool.

All of these things can be indicated by the water temp gauge, that's why it's shown in your vehicle. Also it lets you know when the heater will start working lol."

Caster can sometimes be adjusted by moving the front subframe but it is not really required if your barely out of spec ( look at the numbers left and right not the colours - they’re pretty close, less than 0.5 deg caster difference left and right)

Camber is also probably not really adjustable without some aftermarket upper/lower arms or possibly by moving the subframe.

Steer ahead and thrust angle are good front and back so it should drive nicely enough for daily use.

Toe angles are in spec so tyre wear should be okay. Might get a bit of inside shoulder wear on the front right but it’s unlikely to make a major difference on longevity.

1n1v6da,Need advise on my AWD 2016 Santa Fe Ltd Ultimate,"I have a 2016 Hyundai Santa Fe Ltd Ultimate (AWD) with 142,000 miles on it. For the past 3 months or so, when I'm already going 35-40mph or more, and I gently accelerate...for example, on a 55mph road, slowing down for an upcoming light that turns green when I'm slowed down 5-10mph & then slowly accelerate back up to 55mph, or pass a car on a 4 lane highway, or the speed limit goes from 45 to 60...there's a noise that sounds like it's coming from either the back tires or back end of the car, it's a rhythmic baboop baboop baboop baboop, as though I'm riding over evenly spaced lines or cracks on the road...only I'm not. The noise stops as soon as I'm up to speed & no longer accelerating. I'm not accelerating quickly, or blowing cars off the road passing them, it's slow, steady acceleration.Tbh sometimes I'm not positive it's coming from the back end or more in the middle.

 I also have had a problem for the last 18 months or so, when I make a turn the back tires feel and sound like parts of the tire are momentarily repeatedly losing their grip on the road all through the turn. Bumpbumpbumpbumpbumpbump all the way around the corner. Fast or slow. It's not every single turn, but most. And gets progressively worse throughout the day. If I turn very slowly & gingerly w my foot off the gas (not always possible)  I can sometimes keep it from happening. I do home visits, we cover 5 counties. I drive for work averaging about 50-75 miles a day. Some days more like 125+. By the middle of the day it's every single turn whether around a corner, or in a parking lot. New tires didn't take care of the problem. My kid suggested maybe the differential. The Hyundai dealership checked it out and did work on the swaybars about a year ago & it helped 99% but slowly got bad again. I did recently have the differential fluid changed, that didn't help. 

I'm worried that the noise the car is making during acceleration is something that's making the car unsafe to drive. All I've heard is ""unable to duplicate customer complaint."" Then they need to keep on driving til things are good & warmed up. But now I'm furious. I went back to the Hyundai dealership & the service advisor says ""sounds like it's the transmission & that's going to run $400 to diagnose & $3500-4500 for a new transmission. With 142k miles on it, wouldn't it be more cost effective to buy a new car?"" I'm no mechanic, but I'm no idiot & this isn't my 1st car. It isn't showing any signs/symptoms of transmission problems. Or am I wrong? He also said it could be the transfer case since I have AWD. The AWD is not full-time & has to be manually turned on, and it's only been used 3-4 times for very short periods climbing slippery hills in winter. I never cruise in AWD. My manual says the AWD ""falls off"" at 30-40 mph when it is engaged. So I don't use it, except in dicey situations. Does the transfer case sound right? Then I was introduced to a salesman who tried to sell me a Kona. I know dealerships do this underhanded crap, and I only took it there because my regular shop said, when I asked them about checking the differential, ""We don't have the machine needed to check a differential, the nearest one is in Chicago."" (90 miles away) I thought well that doesn't sound right! I don't know if mechanics see a 64 yr old woman & think I don't know what I'm talking about, am just nuts, or what. I'm not. Idiot salesman thinks he's going to talk me into buying a new car 😆😂🤣🤣🤣. I will not be taking the car to the dealership again.

Does anyone have any idea what could be making that thump thump noise when I accelerate? It doesn't do it when I'm accelerating from a dead stop, only after I hit around 35mph or so. It isn't loud like a broken strut, but it's there. It stops when I let off the accelerator.  I am concerned about the safety of this vehicle. It's been a good car since I've had it, (3yrs/45k miles), no issues.

1n1sfun,Break advice?,"Posting on behalf of my sister - 2017 Subaru Outback, 89,000 miles

ok:

July 2024, I had all 4 rotors and brake pads changed by a local auto shop that had good reviews online. They changed all four rotors and pads without giving me a quote/asking first and was hit with a $850ish bill with no warning. Should have been my first red flag. 

The brakes were squealing shortly after being replaced. I went back to the original auto shop and had them take a look again. They first tried to blame it on the “rain” (it was a dry summer). They lubed them up with no charge.   

They were still squealing but I just lived with it. Here recently, it started squealing pretty bad, and I figured it might be time to replace them. 

I decide to go to a new auto shop after being burned by the first. I gave them the full rundown that you just read above. 

They take a look and say the brake pads need to be soaked bc the original shop didn’t lube them up when they originally installed them. They soak them and charge me $300 for it. When I pick it up, they were firm in saying “we got you fixed up, your car doesn’t squeal anymore” 

Well, I drive away and the brakes are still squealing. Not as bad as it was before, but definite squeal. 

I call the auto shop back, and they say if they’re still squealing, it is either a bigger problem or the original auto shop just gave me cheap pads. He said they didn’t notice a problem when they soaked the pads, so he thinks the auto shop just used cheap ones. His suggestion was that I call the original auto shop, complain, and demand an upgrade. They did everything they could. 

Here’s my predicament. I don’t want to deal with the original auto shop. I’ve dealt with them twice and both times have walked out of it with nothing. It was also a year ago, so I don’t know that it’s worth messing with them. I also feel like it’s the new shops problem now that I’ve paid them $300 for nothing. 

I called them back one more time and decided I’m taking it back to the new shop in the morning to have them look at it again. They finally said if the brake pads are cheap and I need new ones, they’ll replace them for me and deduct the $300 that I paid for. 

What are your thoughts? Is this new shop screwing me and should they help me on this? Why are my brakes still squealing??? What would you do?? 

Not relevant but want to note that I am side eyeing this new shop because they asked me if I wanted to tip my mechanic on top of my $300 bill (that was all labor, no parts btw).

I have had some hardware issues with cheap aftermarket brake pad kits.   Soak brake pads in what?, brake cleaner?, bg stop squeal?  I never soak brake pads in anything, nor do i use a lot of lubricant on brake pads.  The slide pins need to be cleaned, and lubricated with something safe for rubber, like sil glide or similar lube.  Where the brake pads move on the hardware can be installed with no lube at all.  That said, if aftermarket pads are installed, i have installed many sets with no noise. Imo that shop needs to determine where the noise is coming from.  A good mechanic can find the source, but the guys that know what they are doing are going to want to get paid for the checkout.  Youre kinda in a rut to go back to oe pads, most of them need oe shims, which can be as expensive as the brake pads, and were probably discarded by original shop.  If you know where the noise is coming from( front or rear), and they are not willing to machine the rotors, and get some oe hardware and a new set of pads, i would go to another shop. You shouldnt spend but about 300 on machining, new pads, some hardware for front or rear. This shouldnt be a very difficult thing to figure out.

I’m looking for advice on choosing between two cars. I’ll be driving about **80 miles per day** for work, so fuel economy, comfort, and long-term reliability are really important.

The two options are:

* **2025 Nissan Kicks** – brand new, warranty, very fuel-efficient, lower running costs.
* **2022 VW Tiguan S 4Motion** – 33,000 miles, AWD, more powerful and comfortable, priced at **$22,997** (see listing attached).

Both are within the same budget range.  
My concerns:

* The Kicks seems smarter for fuel and maintenance since it’s new.
* The Tiguan is bigger, AWD (which is good for Massachusetts winters), and my husband loves it, but I’m worried about higher running costs and reliability of a used VW.

**Questions:**

1. Which would you recommend for someone commuting 80 miles daily?
2. Is the Tiguan at 33k miles reliable enough, or would the new Kicks give me more peace of mind?

This is a huge red flag... it is not normal for a vehicle to use this amount of coolant, their is either a leak which should be visible, or there are significant mechanical issues internally to the engine. I mean, it is normal to have some loss of coolant, off-gassing or evaporation for example, but a cup or so a year, not gallons.

I would recommend getting this addressed with by a trusted, qualified shop and if no issues are noted getting the cooling system flushed and filled properly. It is possible there was a leak that was addressed by the previous owner and they just never through out the empties, but at this point since it is low again I would suspect the issue is still present.

Otherwise, the issue of mixing coolant probably is less important than making sure you have coolant in the system since it needs to be flushed anyway. You seem to have the correct coolant and that is the best you can do at this point. Top it off and keep it full until it can be addressed properly."

2015 Lincoln Navigator 3.5l TT ecoboost 180K. I was in the Nevada desert on the way home from a trip. Flashing check engine on the highway but then disappeared. Pulled over to pee and then acceleration was poor and CE light stayed on solid. Had my code reader and P0301 was present.

Nearest town was about 60 miles or so away. They only have a NAPA which would have been closed by the time I got there. I was going to buy a coil and a plug and tools to do the job but that would have required a motel room / sleep in car and I was about total 250 miles away from home.

Drove home running on 5 cyl and made it. Installed a spare used OEM coil that fixed the issue. Later that day, P0420 came on. I cleared it and it came back on shortly later. Hooked up my laptop and the downstream o2 on bank 1 was generally following bank 2 and when the cats were warmed up and holding around 2.5K voltage would be mostly steady around .8v but had dropouts unlike bank 2.

I have an inexpensive infrared temp gun and inlet at both cats was roughly the same around 375 degrees F. Outlet around both was about 500 degrees f.

* When I discovered the issue, should I have unplugged the fuel injector so it didn't dump fuel in and drove home? I called two of my friends who both said it wasn't necessary. I kinda was leaning towards I should have but I also thought maybe the coil was partially working and some fuel was contributing.
* Since the cat temp inlet and outlet with my cheap gun seems to be okay, the cat can still be bad correct? Just not as efficient at the computer is looking for correct? Also, upsteam o2 is new OEM from this year, 2nd o2 I don't know when or if it was changed (bought truck used with 150K).

On both occasions, I had driven for 10 - 20 minutes, parked at a strip mall, and come back to my car within an hour. I turned the key and the car cranked but the engine didn’t start. I waited a beat, tried again, still no start. But on the third or fourth attempt, the engine caught and then everything was normal. So I drove home. And I drove it some other times without issue after each of the problem starts.

After the second problem I made an appointment with my mechanic. They haven’t been able to reproduce the problem. They have tested the battery, starter, and alternator and all of those are fine.

What are some likely explanations for my car’s symptoms? Are any of them cheap enough to fix that it’d be reasonable to have them addressed without knowing for sure they are the cause? If the problem happens again, what should I pay attention to in order to figure out what the cause is?

1n1jjn2,2015 Acura MDX P0333 code after timing belt change,"2015 Acura MDX SHAWD

31000 miles, original owner

I had my timing belt replaced with the Aisin kit last month with a local reputable shop.  When I I first told him how many miles, he said I should save my money and based on his experience, they go a lot longer.  I told him I wanted it done anyway due to the age of the car.

3 days after I got it back, I got a CEL and I looked up the code, it was P0333 which is a high voltage from the knock sensor 2.  I knew they had to unplug some connectors to do the timing belt job, so I pushed in the plugs a bit to see if anything was loose.  After that the CEL went away for a while, but maybe 2 weeks after that, the CEL came back on and the same code showed up.  

The CEL was on when I turned off the car at night, but in the morning when I took my car back to him a couple of days ago to check out, the CEL cleared itself.  I dropped my car off and he said looked over everything and disconnected and reconnected the connectors to the module to make sure everything was in tight.  The next day the CEL came on again and it's the same P0333 code.  I disconnected the connectors and used electronics cleaner on the connections to see if maybe dirt or something got in there.  I haven't turned on my car to drive today, but I have a feeling the code will come back.

Is it possible that the timing belt is a bit off and causing this error?  My engine runs very smooth and I don't feel or hear anything weird.  Could it be that my knock sensor is really the problem given the age of my car?  I plan to call him when he opens to let him know it came on again, but not sure exactly what the next steps would be.

Ask your insurance agent. The cheapest cars to insure are the cheapest to fix. If you don't have an agent then ask friends and friends of friends.

Still can't find the source of drain on the battery and running out of tests to find it.,"Trying to figure out why the battery doesn't want to stay charged for more than 36 hours in a 2007 Scion tC.

There doesn't seem to be any indications in the car itself, such as lights flickering or anything. The lights all work, the horn works.

I've been removing the negative battery connection every time it gets parked. After reconnecting it and starting the car, it turns on normally but quickly turns off, but the second time it turns on it behaves 100% normally. I've read that this is normal in some Toyota models as the car computer has to relearn some information on the throttle and idle.

The battery has been tested at two auto parts places, as well as at Interstate Battery where it was purchased. It's not a faulty battery.

The alternator showed 13.4-13.6 volts at the battery, which is within normal range on Toyota's. Despite that, and despite the fact that it was replaced 5k miles ago, I pulled it out of the car and took it to a local spot that rebuilds them and had it bench tested. They said there was no issue in it.

Testing the amps across the negative terminals showed a draw of .025 amps, again in the normal range and not indicative of anything taking too much power.

Testing the voltage across the tops of every fuse in the car with the battery hooked back up showed only one 7.5 amp fuse measuring anything at all, and it was 0.1 volts, which converted to mA using a conversion chart is also not enough to drain the battery. I took measurements repeatedly over the course of like 45 minutes just waiting for one to begin spiking and none ever did.

Checking voltage drop across the positive terminal and the output stud of the alternator with the car running and every component turned on showed 0.186 volts, which I believe is supposed to be under 0.250, so all good there.

Checking voltage drop across the negative terminal and the case of the alternator showed .057 volts, which I don't know the threshold, but was told the number is also within the normal range.

And now I don't know what to test anymore.

The only thing I can think of is, instead of checking for voltage drop between the terminal posts and the alternator, I need to do the same test again and have the lead touching the terminal connector instead. Is this a decent idea? 

Or what other tests should I try out next?",1,1756269695.0,5,AskMechanics,1756409691,2025-08-27 04:41:35,2025-08-28 19:34:51,"rideatruck (Score: 1): Long shot here since no one else has offered anything but it involves LED taillights, try in the dark and look for a faint glow at the taillights make sure everything is turned off.

Sometimes it dips to 13.9, but rarely and usually when it's hot as hell outside. Driving it charges at 14.2 to 14.3 and sometimes a quick jump to 14.4, but it's always 14v.

Looking for a reality check. Back in October 2024, I brought my 2017 Subaru Impreza (~55k miles at the time) to a mechanic and specifically requested a full brake overhaul. The invoice (totaling $1,474.20) included:

	•	New front + rear pads
	•	New front + rear rotors
	•	Rear brake shoes (parking brake system)
	•	Rear calipers + caliper kits
	•	Labor

Now the car has failed inspection less than a year later. Rear brake failure was the cited culprit and my car is now off the road awaiting further repair. The inspector personally showed me the rear brakes: completely ground to nothing, unsafe to drive, and in his opinion, never replaced at all by the original mechanic. The front brakes are completely fine. 

My questions:

	1.	Is there any scenario where rear brakes + rotors could realistically go from “new” to “completely gone” in 9k miles? Seems basically impossible.

	2.	Does this sound like negligence, or is this likely just straight up in the territory of fraud? I’m just trying to figure out how this could even happen in a shop. 

	3.	How would you suggest I proceed? So far I’ve gotten no response back from the original shop requesting explanation.

Thanks in advance — trying to make sure I’m not missing some weird edge case before I escalate this.

deadass_nibba420 (Score: 9): I have seen bad calipers ruin new pads in under 5k miles. Some of the time, pushing in a caliper can disturb the seal, causing the caliper to fail shortly after a fresh brake job. Looking at your invoice it shows a “brake caliper kit” was billed, I would say just based on the price, that would have been a hardware kit that would come with new shims and rubber grommets, not full caliper replacement. I don’t think this is outright fraud. Calipers fail sometimes, it happens."

1n14eou,Is my transmission shop trying to sell me on an unnecessary transmission rebuild?,"2015 Infiniti Q50 3.7 AWD, 7 speed automatic, 107,000 miles

I'm skeptical of the transmission shop that has my car right now. I changed my transmission fluid about 750 miles ago (drain and refill, not a flush). It looked completely fine to me. It didn't smell burnt, darkish red, zero metal shavings. My transmission felt great.

My car recently went into limp mode. It didn't shift past 3rd gear. I drove it no more than 10 miles while it was in limp mode before I had it towed to a shop. It also was showing code P0720 for the speed shaft output sensor.
Infiniti has said that this code usually correlates with a transmission valve body issue, a known problem on this car. Aside from the transmission limiting gears to 1-3, shifts felt fine and I didn't notice any slipping or clunking.

The shop just looked at my car today and said the fluid was burnt and there were metal shavings in the fluid. They are recommending a full transmission rebuild for $6000.

Wouldn't there be chunks in the fluid if some type of major failure of the transmission happened? Or at least another CEL code relating to gear ratios? Am I in denial, or is the shop trying to sell me on a more profitable rebuild?

i drove it from arkansas to colorado, then drove it around mostly flat colorado for two years. not a whole lot of weather here, and id never be driving it on the odd occasion it actually snows here.

im pretty sure dead batter bc it wont start, but also it would sometimes shudder when stopped at lights, or stall out when in reverse- im not too sure thats entirely my potentially shitty driving, but maybe it is.

it has headers rather than usual exhaust system, but one pipe was...artistically... bashed in to fit the steering rod\*? so that side doesnt lie flush to the engine so there is a constant exhaust leak. there is also no rear tailpipe or catalytic converter. (\*not a mechanic)

the headlights kinda suck, theyre rather dim and i think? aimed badly. the passenger door is currently roped shut lmfao bc the mechanism broke, with the rubber gasket removing itself from the mechanism and getting jammed. the replacement part i ordered from lmc truck, also had that very same problem startingto happen so i returned it. they didnt have a different one to send lmao

at that point i was kinda frustrated w the truck and so it's just been sitting, since it stopped starting easily. i think the exhaust leak just got too bad that it would start, but the engine wouldnt ""catch"" unless im sitting there with my foot carefully monitoring the gas for a while.................i hate that.  
its very pollutitive, smelly. and loud for my neighbors in the apartments around me.

also- i have driven a whole lot of newer rental cars, and i hate most of them. the constant fucking beeping for everything. lowkey probably tracking you somehow. no knobs, only omnipresent screen. electronic everything, not an exaggeration. the windsheild has a sensor that has to do something with a computer and itll cost $$$$ to replace? wtf is that shit. did i mention the beeping!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

im not really a mechanic, i dont know fuck all about shit. i got le truck from my brother for pretty dang cheap, and we've talkedd about it at length bc he's a mechanic. but i'm not a mechanic, so i want some outside opinions other than what he tells me.

i am aware that it being so older makes it ""easier to work on"" because the spark plugs are like right there etc. it's an s10 and so parts are plentiful or something

but am i clinging to a dream?

im going to spend money regardless-

would it be worthwhile to get a new engine, trnasmission and exhaust system on the truck?

or should i just learn to let this go, and get a newer car i might hate that is plastic but will definitely pass an emmisions test lol

even if i sell it, i need to get it running.  when i put a new battery in it, should i start it? or should i take it to le shop and let them do whatever and let them start it?

the current plan is to just tow it to the shop and have them work whatever magic needs to happen, bc i also want some seperate estimates on how much it would cost to replace engine trans exhaust trio, but also how much just to get it to pass emissions. 92 is too new for a colorado exception.

My passenger and I have mobility issues and struggle with my current car, and all the cars I looked so far at aren’t much better as far as seat height goes.

A Vauxhall Mokka X was perfect for seat height and legroom, but has the massive downside of being a Vauxhall Mokka X.

Hey guys,

I’ve been working on a passion project to unify and consolidate our community and I want to start spreading the word, I’m really looking forward to hearing your feedback and or questions.

Problem: The UK car scene is massive, but right now it’s spread across Instagram, Facebook groups, WhatsApp chats, forums, and word-of-mouth.
Solution: One app that pulls it all together.

I’m building something that aims to do just that:
	•	Create your own profile and use it to join clubs all created and managed in app
	•	Easily connect with other enthusiasts nearby or across the UK with our swipe feature
	•	A single point of contact for meets, cruises, and events – no more chasing Facebook events or missing last-minute updates
	•	Share your builds, media, and updates in one place
	•	Discover new clubs, events, and people you wouldn’t otherwise meet

The vision: whether you’re a solo enthusiast, part of a club, or someone organising events, this app makes it easy to connect, plan, and grow the scene together.

Right now, I’m starting outreach to hear what the community I’m building for truly wants and needs.

I’m looking for:
	•	Feedback – what would make this genuinely useful for you or your club?
	•	Early members – people/clubs who want to help with beta testing.
	•	And if any potential investors/partners are interested, I’d love to chat.

If you want to be a part of creating a proper hub for the UK (and soon global) car scene, drop a comment or DM me for more information. Lets make more connections and make more memories 🏁",11,1756330103.0,15,CartalkUK,1756409691,2025-08-27 21:28:23,2025-08-28 19:34:51,"Parzalai (Score: 5): How much ai was used here

I visited NZ years ago and there were multi station jet wash bays where you wash your car yourself. Foam lance with brush etc.

Plenty of them over here in petrol stations but I wouldn’t go near one and wouldn’t dream of scouring my car with the ‘soft’ brush. 

My idea is something similar, but with added extras, proper snow foam, deionised water for rinsing, vending machine for dispensing wash mitt if necessary. 

These plus an ‘interior’ bay with powerful hoovers, fragrance etc. 

My thinking is an offer that’s not just there to offer it, but somewhere more for the enthusiast who may not have the space to jet wash or do their car properly at home.

Autotrader shows the valuation for a private seller of between £9,226 and £11,481.

I appreciate second hand dealers have markups for vehicle prep, advertising, overheads etc, so I've factored in 15% on top, is that fair?

A similar car, albeit the auto version (This one's manual), 1 year younger, with 10K less miles on it just sold for £13,500 privately, Autotrader valued that at between £13,825 and £14,250.

I don't need the annual breakdown cover they're throwing in, so factored in a deduction of £100.

The car has a partial service history - 2 main dealer stamps, and the rest are ""receipts"" from the previous owners local garage which the dealer claims to have contacted and confirmed the work in the receipts. By his own admission he's written these all in to the service book, but hasn't stamped anything.

The car had a crease on the top part of the passenger door, which he's sent me photos of having it removed, as well as 2 gauges/dents in the bonnet which looked like a hook had landed on it.  I notice he's bumped the price up on Autotrader now by an extra £250.

He previously informed me as I'm not part exchanging anything he'd throw in double the RAC warranty being offered, which from memory I think would make it 6 months, but I may aim to wrangle 12 months.

2. I did consider parts from eBay but that's a real gamble as it's not clear where they are from or their condition. Secondly and key to this is my knowledge of cars extends to knowing how to drive one and there's a big engine hidden away somewhere
3. I've asked two separate garages for their view. It's not that I don't trust the quote, but I know some may advise reputable parts or have other views. I just want to consider thing sbefore going ahead with this
4. Some have warned of the **wet belt** which I doubt the garage have looked at. I can't be sure, but they said they found the fault with the turbo and may not have examined the belt. This could add a huge expense on - some saying £1k+

I'd be looking at a hard top Mk III (no older than 2008ish) but I'm wondering if this is a bit stupid considering my commute. 

I'm also slightly concerned about being invisible to other drivers, however I often feel that way in my Aygo, and I could actually manoeuvre a bit better in traffic with a nippy little MX-5. I'm also aware of the potential rust problems.

Any thoughts?

1n1j3xk,Kia Niro (3),"Hello

Looking for advice as by no means a car expert. My diesel Mazda 3 died a death recently so in the market for a new car. Wife has stipulated she wanted more leg room in the front seat when car seats were in the back and still have a decent sized boot. 

I do 20k miles a year so I have reserved a secondhand Kia Niro 3 (newest model 72 reg 20k miles) hybrid (not the plug-in version). This is after cancelling a qashqai yesterday that was the same age and had only done 6k miles (and was 2k cheaper too).

Wife prefers the qashqai but 40 mpg (nissan) Vs 60 mpg (Kia) virtually means a 1k saving each year. 

Just looking to seek more knowledgeable persons opinions please. Need the car to last well over 100k miles and 6+ years. The Kia still has the rest of the 7 year warranty remaining. I've done a fair bit of research and hope I'm doing the right thing (I'd get either Skoda Octavia or Toyota corlolla estate but wife says no to estates).

Looking for some independent views on this incident a few weeks back in Milton Keynes the home of roundabouts. 

There are 3 lanes in approach to the roundabout which go into 1 left turn (red line) and 3 on the roundabout. The 3rd party vehicle is in the middle lane on approach, and must be going straight over, and should take the blue path. I am going straight over and take the yellow path. We have similar progress into the roundabout before the 3rd party cuts me off and takes the yellow path (as purple is for turning right). I move slightly over to the right lane in anticipation to prevent more contact given i notice the 3rd party is too close and appears to be entering my lane (something the insurer says is against me - despite the implication that being more forthright and causing more damage would have reduced likelihood of liability...). The contact then pushes me firmly over into the righthand lane.

The insurer has said that the 3rd party vehicle does not change lanes - enters from and to the middle lane - and because I'm the one moving lanes - entering from the right to the middle - this increases likelihood of my liability to me, even though they did not enter the roundabout on the correct lane and I was entering the correct lane. I appreciate there are no entry lines, but if the 3rd party vehicle does not use the left lane on the roundabout, what does it exist for?!

Competent road users, please advise me of your views in this situation as I feel the insurer is completely wrong (and if so, what steps i can take to push this matter).

I could see your hesitation as you realised he was now there, arguably you may have had time to swerve back but who knows in the heat of the moment.

You can get a used unit. But you have no idea what condition it's in and you can't realistically expect your garage to warranty it as a result. If they fit it and it turns out to be bad, at the end of the day, you supplied the part. Even then, I doubt most garages would want to take on the job simply due to that very hassle.

Here’s a refined breakdown of the most common faults reported on the 2010 Alfa Romeo MiTo, drawing from verified sources across owner communities and expert platforms:


---

Engine & Mechanical Issues

Timing Chain / Belt

Persistent rattling from the timing chain, especially at startup, is common and may worsen—potentially leading to serious engine damage. Depending on the source, replacement costs vary—around £840 on FixMyCar  or £852 on StillMotoring .


MultiAir Valve/Unit Failures (for MultiAir petrol engines)

Pre-Nov 2012 MultiAir units can fail due to dislodged pistons, causing misfires, rough running, or loss of compression .

Owners report noise from the cam area and misfire issues when the MultiAir fails .

Expert advice: keep up with proper servicing, oil level, and using the correct oil to reduce risk .


Turbocharger / Turbo Seal

Turbo seals may deteriorate, causing loss of power, black smoke, noisy acceleration, and engine warning lights .

Cracks in turbo pipes can trigger warning lights under engine load .



---

Transmission & Gearbox

Gearbox noise, especially in higher gears like sixth, is a frequent complaint—and may require a full gearbox repair if left unchecked .

Specific faults such as bearing wear, grinding, gear slipping, hydraulic actuator failure, and fluid leaks are reported for the C635 6-speed manual unit .



---

Steering & Electrical

Electric Power Steering (EPAS) failures occur intermittently, sometimes with costs up to £700 for replacement .

On Reddit, users mention that a failing battery often triggers power steering failure at low speeds; replacements or refurbished modules (~£500) can resolve it .

Wiring to the tailgate can also degrade, affecting rear lights, wipers, and heated rear screens .



---

Cold Weather & Other Peculiarities

In RHD cars built before February 2010, windscreen drain design can allow water into the alternator, which may freeze and damage belts or alternator—an improved drain was introduced in Feb 2010, retrofittable for about £20 .



---

Paint & Body

Red (“Rosso Alfa”) paint on early models is susceptible to stone chips, especially on wheel arches, bonnet, and front bumper—normal enough that Alfa briefly stopped selling red MiTos in 2010 .



---

Suspension, Electrical & Other Minor Concerns

Front suspension wear is not uncommon—look for worn anti-roll bar links, bearings causing noise on lock-to-lock turns, and potential adaptive damping failures .

Electrical glitches, failing sensors, or dashboard warning light issues (including airbag sensor faults) are fairly frequent .

Early cars can suffer from paint chipping, rusting wheel nuts, and hard-to-shift first gears .

Regular servicing, especially of the cambelt, is critical—costs around £400, replacement timing varies by engine and usage .

Owner Insights (Reddit Highlights)

> “...the power steering sometimes fails at low speeds. 99 % of the time this is down to a dodgy/under-charged battery… Occasionally… the rack itself… new it's an expensive fix…”




> “The multiair units die and they are very expensive to replace… lifters can fall out the bottom and into the engine.”




> “If it’s the regular 1.4 TB it doesn’t have an MA unit… I owned a 1.4 MA… never had an issue, and it only ever needed routine maintenance.”

Buying Tips for a 2010 MiTo

1. Service History: Confirm regular maintenance—especially oil changes—for MultiAir reliability.


2. Inspect engine start: Listen for timing chain rattle and check for warning lights or misfires.


3. Test drive: Pay attention to gearbox smoothness, steering feel (especially EPAS), and any unusual powers steering behavior.


4. Visual checks: Look for paint damage, especially on red models; check for rust on wheel nuts.


5. Suspension check: Listen for clunks over bumps and inspect undercarriage for wear.


6. Cold start test: If in cold weather, ensure alternator drains aren't blocked (post-2010 drain retrofit desirable).


7. Incremental parts: Verify tailgate electronics and minor sensor functionality."

benford266 (Score: 27): It Does look loose in this video but you wouldn't check the stretch there as thats between the cam shafts and moving one slightly you can get that look. Also when the engines not running they may settle slightly into that spot due to spring pressure.

You really need to check where the tensioner is and if it's at max extension. Also depending on engine it may be hydraulic so when running it will tension, when off it could loose pressure and become slightly loose.

Hows the engine sound when running that will be the biggest tell.

EUskeptik (Score: 14): Timing chain and tensioner(s) definitely need replacing. £1350 sounds about right.

If you don’t do the work, the chain will snap causing catastrophic damage to the engine. The bill for a new engine approximates to the value of the car, so not worth the risk. The chain could snap at any time so *do not delay*."
