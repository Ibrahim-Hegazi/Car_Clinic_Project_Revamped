1n59wiz,07 Toyota Camry Hybrid A/C not working,"Hey guys, I got this 07 Toyota Camry hybrid that I have been trying to diagnose for a while because of a failing or not turning on a/c compressor. I put on a A/C manifold gauge. The low blue side read at 90 psi, the red high side came at almost 95 psi. Before I tried to add R134a with no additive it was, blue low side was at 40 psi which I read was at normal and red high was at 105 psi. My temperature was around 75 degrees. I understand that a new a/c compressor is very expensive new so I went to the junkyard and got a used one that looks like it was in good condition. The oil inside was clean and not black and no visible leak on the outside. Fuses and relays are good. When I hit the low blue side with a flat screw driver, only air hissed out. I was expecting refrigerant to come out.

My 2016 Honda Odyssey is having some sort of issue. I thought changing the belt would help some, but it hasn’t. Immediately after changing the belt, I took the attached video. I unfortunately spilled power steering fluid on the belt, which is what I think is causing the slight squeaking in the video. You can’t see much because I was focusing on moving the phone across the top of the engine to see how the sound varied. The sound is loud when starting the car cold but typically goes away after driving for a short period. I plugged my VIN into Autozone’s VIN decoder and it says that I have a 2016 Honda Odyssey Touring (6 Cylinders 3.5L FI SOHC 212 CID).

Cost was about $120.

Today, radiators.are so cheap, they drove those repair shops out of business. I worked right next to one, and they closed down in 2005. The owner was able to pivot his trade, and became well known for quality work in the heavy equipment side of things. Think bulldozer and heavy earth movers.

I’m not super familiar with your vehicle but based on the washer bottle in the photo, those wires probably go to whats left of your fog light or turn signal. You can buy a new plastic connector housing and swap the wire terminals into it since they look fine. Maybe an H10 connector housing if its a fog light. You can usually pick one up from any auto parts store or order it online. Usually those types of things are less than $15 for the part. You’ll need to watch some videos on how to depin and pin connectors, but its not too bad.

Check your fuses, and otherwise you’d need to start probing with a multimeter. Hopefully its simply come unplugged, but theres not much more I can recommend related to specifics.

Otherwise a mechanic that is familiar with jeep will likely be the fastest at finding the fault and may have the parts on hand rather than a general shop. If you have a trusted mechanic already, take it to them."

You'll need to know if you have the 2.4 liter, 2.5 liter or 2.0 liter turbo engine as it may make a difference in getting the right part. You need a few basic hand tools and probably a few hours if you've never changed a radiator before.

If you do the work yourself, be sure to properly dispose of any waste coolant, and wash down your work area.  Pets and wildlife are attracted to coolant but consuming it will kill them.

Rotors aren’t like brake pads as far as wear goes. The discard thickness on most rotors is 1mm from new. That may seem ridiculous, but compared to the material the pads are made of, by the time that occurs, they’ve been used thoroughly. Like imagine if you took your finger and ran it across concrete super fast back and forth. Your hand is made of a softer material (flesh) and therefore wears down before the concrete does. The pads are your finger and the rotor is the concrete. If you keep at this until the concrete starts to have a groove in it, you can tell it has seen significant wear.

So run your finger nail across the face to the edge, if your fingernail gets caught on the edge, that’s about one mm and it’s time to replace.

1n542j0,'99 Ford Explorer 4.0L - Window rail is misaligned after latch service,"I ""inherited"" a 99 ford explorer that had a lot of random issues. One of them was that the driver's side door latch was broken in a way that it couldn't lock. Where I live, that really isn't an option. So, I got a new latch, replaced it, and all that is working now. But in the process, I had to remove the window retainer because it blocked the latch. The reatiner is held in by a single 11mm bolt near the bottom of the panel. Once that is taken out, it was pretty easy to just move out of the way...

Now that it's all back together, the window is not going down right. I re-installed the retainer, seated it against the corner of the window, and it seems to fit. but when I roll it down, the side of the window going into that retainer binds and so the regulator pulls it down at an angle. If I put enough pressure on the bound side, it'll seat into place and go down the rest of the way with no problem. It also raises with no problem, but once fully raised trying to lower it causes the same problem.

I tried getting the window down and loosening the retainer so I could fully seat it as best as possible, but that didn't seem to help.

I notice that the retainer itself feels a little flimsy as I have it when the window is fully up. During my troubleshooting, I pulled it out, looked at the felt runners and inspected it. I don't see what I could be missing. ChatGPT mentions that there's a ""locator tab"". The part I'm describing is: [Retainer - Ford (F77Z-78222A01-AA)](https://ford.oempartsonline.com/oem-parts/ford-retainer-f77z78222a01aa) \- looking at the diagram and part, I don't see what that could be.

1n53qfc,Six serpentine belts continuously breaking,"I’m hoping to get some fresh ideas because I’m losing money on tows and I really just want to drive my car. I have a 2002 Chevy Malibu (3.1L V6) that’s gone through at least 6 serpentine belts this year. I used up all my insurance tows in the span of 4 days in April when the belt slipped/broke multiple times and now I’m just paying out of pocket every time to get it towed to the shop but nothing they do is fixing the issue from happening again a few days later and I’m at a loss. 

The first few couple times the belt shredded completely. The third & fourth time it just came loose then snapped in half which is when I think they tightened and then replaced the tensioner. Fifth time they replaced my entire power steering and then again my tensioner because they said it seemed faulty. That was three weeks ago. I finally got around to driving it last Sunday and this Wednesday I drove it around for a cumulative total of 3 hours before the belt broke. This time it’s split down the middle in one section but not fully shredded apart. 

I was telling my sister about my woes and I mentioned my AC going out and how I can never get around to fixing it with these other repairs happening and she made a comment that maybe my AC is why my belt keeps breaking. Now neither of us know a thing about cars but could that actually be a reason? My AC light does flicker on and off and blows warm/hot when it’s doing that but I’ve never paid any attention to when that’s happened and how soon after that my belt breaks to draw any correlation between the two.

1n52604,2004 Acura MDX - intermittent no start no crank - single loud click,"Hi guys I have a 2004 Acura MDX that has an intermittent starting issue. 

It has 150,000 miles. The battery and alternator were both replaced within the past couple months. The battery failed a load test and the alternator was an original that recently failed. I believe the starter was replaced 4 years ago with a Denso product.

I had this intermittent no start issue in the past but it seemed to go away after the battery replacement so I didn't think anything of it. But the problem returned. I'm leaning towards this only being an issue when hot, but I've had the issue in the past in the mornings so that's not definitive. The most recent event where this problem happened was when doing an errand. Drove over to Target, parked. Came back 10 minutes later, and the car failed to start. I left the car, moved on with some work, and came back 2 hours later. The car happened to start after resting. 

I'm unable to replicate the problem on command. It just seems to happen sometimes. 

I've done my research and a part of me wonders if relays going bad could build up internal resistance, causing them to over heat, thus resulting in poor 'relay' performance. I've always heard of a Honda Main Relay and doing research I'm having a lot of trouble understanding if the 2004 MDX has a ""Main Relay"". I'm seeing info of a PGM-FI relay but nothing that actually says it's for a 2004 model. I see plenty that show 2001-2003. I've checked under the dash and I don't see anything that looks like the PGM-FI Relay from a 2003.

That’s a common complaint when people have starting complaints. 

The main relay on these aren’t the same style of the type that fail on older Hondas and Acuras. When they do fail it will present as a crank no start. Not a single click.

old_lackey (Score: 1): The only easy thing that comes to mind is something I saw many years ago...a starter needs over 9v during crank to operate at all.  Most batteries will deliver about 10v to almost 11v at deepest (hardest) part of cranking to operate the starter due to voltage drop under load.

Given you mentioned heat, I'd guess you have either a corroded power wire to the starter or a corroded connection to your starter.

A fresh, topped off, battery gives just enough to engage the starter bendix and get turning.  After time you're wondering in & out of minimum cranking voltage at the starter due to lower battery health but mainly a poor/bad connection.

Take a multimeter with a hold or min/max feature, and connected to the positive starter terminal and the starter ground. Then crank the car and see what the reading is. If the reading is 9 V or lower the starter is not actually getting enough power due to corroded wiring or corroded connection, assuming your battery is correctly charged above 12.25 VDC.

It's an easy thing to check and if you find your incredibly close to 9 V then this is probably your issue anyway. A normal car shouldn't be below 10V at crank at the starter terminals.

Since you can't always catch it in act if you're right on the border or you're close to the border this is most likely a problem because the using the car is going to cause the connections that are corroded to change resistance whether it's based on heat or whether it's based on vibration/movement.

You just need a good  multimeter to do this, so it's just mostly time and trying to clip connections to the correct places for safety. You don't need to part swap or buy a bunch of extra stuff to go down this avenue of investigation.

Also to be clear you need to be touching the battery post and the screw terminal to the starter to be extra accurate in this test. If you connect your meter to the crimp connections of the cabling it could say the correct voltage but you could still receive a drop at the physical connection to the screw terminals or battery post. You need to touch the actual connector on the device so that you're also testing that the crimping in your cable is not corroded."

1n516a1,Bad Starter/Flywheel? Pt2,"Greetings again! 

Made a post yesterday asking about my friends 2017 Chevy Traverse 3.6 that’s making a terrible noise when trying to start the car. 

Y’all suggested it sounded more like the starter/flywheel. I pulled the starter and bench test it at home and then over to autozone for shiggles and it tested good. Looked in the hole the starter was in at the flywheel and the teeth looked ok but I didn’t spin the thing over to check all the teeth…

Slapped it back together and that’s the first part of the video you see. It spun the crank for a sec and then nothing but noise.

It's in rough shape and when we bought it we drove it to our friends driveway about 24 miles away from where we bought it. Didnt really do much to get it going just filled up the tires and some gas and it was going. 

However the car drove very rough and felt like it had no power even when flooring it to see how it reacted so it was tough just keeping up with traffic on the way home. When we are finally 2 turns away from out friends I noticed it started smoking through the vents(didn't have any ac on just the windows down) as well as the hoods and from the exhaust as well for a short time. We were really close to home so we just drove slow the last 2 minutes and parked it. 

Now I'm worried what the problem would be because the whole car felt like it got hotter when this happened and although it was for a short amount of time I'm worried we might have a bad head gasket or piston ring. Today we're starting small and just swapping the wiring and spark plugs but I'm confused on what the reason for why it started smoking could be as when I checked the oil dip stick it didn't seem too bad plus there didn't seem to be any oil in the coolant resevoir(although the coolent was very ugly but that's normal I think) 

I am somewhat newish to working on cars I've done brakes and wheel bearings and oil changes but nothing ever engine related besides spark plugs and coil packs so I'm willing to learn I just don't know where to pinpoint the problem and am limited to just throwing parts at it til it's fixed for now ",1,1756658297.0,6,MechanicAdvice,1756755218,2025-08-31 16:38:17,2025-09-01 19:33:38,"Katsuaki (Score: 1): Can't edit post but I'll also say the car seems to run very rich as the oil cap has a smell of fuel and just turning it on makes us smell like fuel

Do we need to replace them before the upcoming winter? We're in Seattle, so it doesn't get brutally hot in the summer, or (usually) much below freezing in the winter.

Perhaps it's being dislodged by the ice or it could be the little foam seals they put around the air doors in the system.  Likely not relevant.

Most cars leak a tiny bit of refrigerant every year.  It's not much but after 10 years it adds up.  You may not have an issue at all except for needing the system recharged.

Just make a note to regularly check your engine oil and keep it between full and a quart low.  That model is known to use oil and there are some warranty things in place - it might be worth talking to a dealer about but I'd guess that it's not bad enough for them to do anything at this point, especially if you have higher miles on it.

TheLabrat01 (Score: 5): A 2011 could easily have enough wear so It's using oil.  I'm going to assume by half way you mean half way between the full an add marks on the dipstick.  If that's the case, than means you burned about half a quart (a pint) of oil.  The oil will make it's way into the combustion chamber where it's burned and exits by the tailpipe.  Since it's not in the sump when burned it will not make the rest of the oil dark.  Since it's a small amount a functioning catalytic converter will complete the combustion and it won't be noticable in the exhaust."

1n55v71,Reverse engineering CAN bus for Renault Magnum cluster,"Hi there! 

I'm trying to recreate the cluster operation from a Renault Magnum/Premium/Midlum. As a hobby, I connect car clusters to Arduino and MCP2515 CAN module and use them with computer games. However, I decided to build a real truck cockpit for Euro Truck Simulator 2 with a real cluster.

I started searching for the CAN IDs using brute force and the J1939 documentation, but unfortunately, I didn't find much. I was only able to get the tachometer and speedometer working. I'm very interested in additional gauges and controls, such as fuel level, turn signals, lights, etc.

Does anyone know of an ID I can check or have access to the CAN BUS log from this vehicle? Potential SAs will also be very helpful! I'd be very grateful for any help!

1n59u3r,The forbidden tick?,Hey yall wondering if this is the forbidden lifter tick I’m hearing? It’s a 2017 1500 5.3L. The tick heard in the video is coming from what sounds like cylinder 1 or the drivers side front of the engine. I noticed it today after changing the oil. 8 quarts of 0W-20 full synthetic was used and then took it on a quick drive. Engine was warm when I got back and after pulling it back into the garage that’s when I noticed the ticking. I also recently changed all spark plugs so at first I thought maybe one of the spark plug wires came loose and what I was hearing was arcing to the block but they were all tight. No check engine lights and no codes from what my cheap little HF scanner can tell me. I also revved the engine to 2000-2500 to see if the ticking got anymore loud and I didnt notice a change. I’m a little conflicted on if this is something to worry about. I don’t have a dead cylinder and I don’t have any codes that I can see.

My wife was driving our Camry 2005 (XLE 3.0L) when the battery warning lit up. She went to a Valvoline for a battery test and was told that the battery was okay, but it was at a 30% charge. So, they advised her to drive it longer to charge it. 

I was skeptical of why would the battery be at this weird low level without any reason. I thought it might be something with the alternator. So, I advised her to come home asap to avoid stalling in the way.

Shortly after she arrived home, the engine stalled. So, I think my diagnosis of a bad alternator was correct.

My question is, how likely is it that something else is the cause? And what could it be?

Also, I am not a mechanic. However, upon doing some research, I think it isn't very hard to replace it myself. Is that true? Or am I just going to regret it? So, any advice on that would be appreciated.

I am especially worried about the tight spacing in a V6 engine, and also not being able to adjust the belt tension correctly after replacing the unit.

1n52qbo,Should the shop be liable?,"Hi everyone, I have been working on rebuilding an old Chevy truck. The motor that was in it when I got it was a 1964 corvette 327 block with some double hump heads on it, etc. I disassembled the motor and then sent it to the machine shop to be refreshed. It was bored .060 over, I got new vortec heads (recommended by builder), and a mild flat tappet street cam. All I installed on it once I got it back was the accessories like carb, water pump, and distributor. The valve lash was set before the first start. I did the correct break in procedure including high zinc oil, primed the oil pump, and set timing. Once I had ran the engine for around 10 minutes total, I noticed some water dripping from the exhaust header collector. I then ran the motor one more time to see if I could figure out if it was just condensation in the exhaust or coolant leaking into the cylinder. After I started it up, it began to spray water out of the driver side tailpipe so I shut it off. I didn’t run the motor anymore after that. I took the #7 cylinder spark plug out and it was wet. I then got a cylinder leak down tool and used compressed air to pressurize the cylinder to check for a leak. I put my ear up to the fill port on the radiator and could hear the air entering the cooling system from the cylinder. I removed the valve covers and found that a couple of rocker arms were now loose and there was definitely water in the oil. I drained the radiator and also the oil. For about the first 30-45 seconds of draining the oil, it was straight coolant, then the oil started coming out. I think the camshaft wiped a lobe because of the large amount of water that entered the oil. The other day, I pulled the engine and removed the intake and head, expecting to find an obvious failure that caused all that water to enter the cylinder but I couldn’t find a broken area in the head gasket, the head looked fine and there weren’t any visible cracks in the cylinder wall. However I did find some decent pitting in the #7 cylinder wall that I think was left by the engine builder. I have read that .060 over is usually as far as you can go with a 327, but the engine builder told me .060 over was enough to clean up all the cylinders. evidently not. The engine was stored in a climate controlled shop with plastic wrap over it during the time between when it was rebuilt and installed into the truck. I’m currently pretty confused as to how the large coolant leak occurred. I think there is a small hole or crack in the pitting that allowed water to enter the cylinder, since the head gasket looks fine. However, the engine builder did not stop and notify me about the pitting in the cylinder before continuing with the rebuild. Had I known that .060 wouldn’t clean up all the cylinders, I would’ve gone with a different engine block, and wouldn’t have spent money on building this engine. Now the camshaft is likely not reusable, and the labor I paid to assemble it was wasted. I will include pictures of the engine. Also included some pictures of lifters that came out of the engine. The pitting is deep and will catch your finger nail easily. I think the shop should pay for a new rebuild",90,1756666266.0,43,AskMechanics,1756755218,2025-08-31 18:51:06,2025-09-01 19:33:38,"Ok-Passage8958 (Score: 53): Yaaa I’d be pissed about that.

Assuming you aren't driving an EV or Hybrid, you almost certainly have a flooded-type (also known as lead acid) battery. These batteries are designed to be recharged as you use them, and letting them get below 50% charge can (and usually does) cause permanent damage, either from hard crystals forming inside the battery itself (the blue fuzzy looking ones you get around old and leaking battery terminals) as well as causing the plates inside the battery to buckle, among other possible issues. This absolutely can result in a permanently unusable battery, or at the very least, battery slippage (where your battery is no longer capable of producing enough CCA, or cold crank amps, to start your car). Depending on how little power your alternator can provide, you could very well have destroyed a perfectly good battery due to a faulty alternator.

In short, yes, a bad alternator can cause a brand new battery to go dead and become unchargeable over time. How much time depends on how much power the alternator can produce."

I first noticed this last night, stopped after a 30 min out of city drive and saw smoke coming from the area of both rear wheels. It didn’t smell like brakes and they were not hotter than my front brakes after touching them 1-2 mins after turning the car off(my previous car had a stuck caliper and there even the car rim itself was scolding hot to the touch, so I suppose it’s not the calipers here). Today after another 30 min drive I saw the same thing - smoking from around the 2 rear wheels, and this time I got a red warning on the dash saying “no coolant” and my temp gauge went to the top, then the warning went away 3-4 seconds later and the temp gauge went down to normal. Currently my aux belt is worn on the outside and I have bought a new belt, pulleys, tensioner and water pump but have not had them changed yet.

Do you have rear climate control?
If so, that could definitely explain why it might be leaking in the rear on the exhaust, because you would likely have heater hoses carrying coolant back there.


I would suggest peeking under the rear to see if you see any dripping, because anywhere it's leaking, it will also suck in air once it cools down, which will create an air pocket in the system that can cause your gauge to quickly move between normal, overheating, & back to normal exactly like you described."

I bought a used car, and ever since I bought it, I have noticed it feels there is a lot of feedback in the steering wheel.

I also feel somewhat obvious vibrations in the floor of the vehicle, but mostly the steering wheel vibration is what I find annoying.

I looked up inside the Carfax and found a link to this report on the tires on the car from a year ago. It appears the alignment came back green light but that outer edges of tires were not great with tread. My question is - could this sort of tread pattern be cause of excessive vibrational feedback that transmits into the steering wheel? I drove a model that was 2 years younger than mine but similar milage and it felt way better with less vibrational feedback. I have been trying to figure out the cause as I had a pre-purchase inspection on the car and that came out with him only having me replace battery. Perhaps he didn't notice this. I also had the tires balanced (which I would have expected them to mention something) because I asked them to check tires but they said tires were fine. The balancing they did changed nothing.

Please note these tests were taken at 56K miles on the car, which now has 59K miles.

1n4lu9a,I let by best friend drive my manual car and it has never drove the same since ...,"Hey everyone, any comments or opinions would be greatly appreciated on this. I'll be very active on this post so feel free to ask any questions if you want more details. 

**TL;DR**

My friend drove the car and shifted roughly (thought he knew how to drive stick properly, but he didn’t). The car doesn't drive the same as it used to. Imagine a car that was brand new from the dealer that was babied and driven perfectly for years, then it was roughed up in a few minutes - no longer shifts the same as it did. It is no longer as predictable, precise, or responsive as it was.

I’ve replaced the entire clutch and all of its components. Along with rear engine mount, and master and slave cylinder. Nothing has worked.

Some very specific things that changed that may be clues:

When I fully depress the clutch to the floor that the clutch petal is able to touch the stopper and makes a click noise every time I shift, it didn't used to do this before. When i bring the petal back up it makes a bang noise when it reaches the top. Didi used to do before.

When I press on the gas petal and release the gas petal, the car slightly jerks. It didn't jerk at all before.

The car goes into gear without any resistance and easily ‘pops’ into gear and it fees like it bounces a bit, and jerks when doing so.

There used to be a lot of resistance when going into gears, it never bounced, it never jerked.

I’m thinking it could be something to do with the transmission, gears, or the hydraulics. If I could narrow it down, it would save me a lot of cash. I’m not spending $34,000 cad on a new manual civic, how is it even possible for the price of a civic to have doubled in 7 years.... But I will spend some money to get what I already have working how it should.

**Some backstory -**

I am a major stick shift enthusiast - My family has two 2018 Honda Civic LX both with manual transmissions that we share. I’ve always loved driving it since that day I got my drivers licence 7 years ago. Back then I had a bunch of friends that were also getting their licence, and I accidentally started the trend of getting everyone into driving manuals. Taught everyone the basics using my car, and they went on to buying their own manual cars too. I kinda became the go-to guy for teaching people to drive stick because I just loved it so much. My Civic drove so well, and was so smooth. I’d always offer to go well out of my way to pick up a friend or to run a far errand for a family member. Smiles per gallon rather than miles per gallon was my way of thinking. Over the years I’ve really gotten used to the feel of the car and I’ve become a pro at rev matching, downshifting, and especially at very smooth shifting. Often I would get compliments from passengers on how it felt like we were in an automatic, because it was just that smooth… that was all up until recently…

**What happened -**

My friend had flown in to visit and he recently picked up driving stick and bought a manual Subaru wrx. I always raved about how well my car drove, and he wanted to try it out and see how it compared to his manual Subaru. I thought nothing of it and was happy to let him drive. So after driving to lunch that day, I let him drive on the way back. He asked if he could 'rip it' a bit to see how fast it was. By that I thought he meant to floor the gas petal and ride out the gears a bit. But what he did haunts me to this day. He was going around 50km (31mph) and downshifted into second, letting up the clutch instantly at high rev’s. I mean instantly. The car jerked back so violently when he shifted gears and I swear I heard a clucking noise come from the engine bay. He then rode out second until it was in high revs and did the same thing to get into third gear, just letting the petal right up without giving it even a moment for it to catch into gear. Again the car jerked violently.

The car had never been driven this violently before, It has always been driven by experienced manual drivers, me, my brother and my parents. The car was bought new. And we never shifted it rough - ever.

I said that was enough of that and asked him to stop shifting so aggressively. I originally thought that since he had a manual car that he would know how to shift properly, I was completely wrong... When I got back into the driver's seat and drove it, I noticed immediate changes to how it shifted.

**How it changed -**

The bite point was not in the same location, it was higher up, and it was more of a range rather than a certain point, no longer as accurate as before. There was a very slight jerk forwards when releasing the gas petal and a jerk backwards pressing the gas petal, in all gears, at all revs. Previously, the car did not jerk even in the slightest when pressing or releasing the gas petal. Downshifting and rev matching were now impossible to make smooth. Instead of the car going into gear smoothly when bringing it to the grabpoint and easily it up slowly from there, the car now hurled itself forward a bit, especially in first, second and third gear it is very noticeable. Engine braking is now out of the picture, because instead of the car coming to a full controlled slow-down when downshifting, it slows down for a second, and then hurls me forward into that gear, and it feels like it bounces back and forth a tiny bit. When shifting into gears the car will bounce a bit too. And when lightly pressing the gas petal it will noticeably jerk. I pretty much have to have my foot depressed on the gas petal always now, because as soon as I let it off, the car will jerk. I also nioticed that when I press the clutch petal down, it hits the floor fully, and makes a tap noice, likely because its hitting the stopper. It never used to do this, and used to be impossible to fully push the petal down to hit the stopper. The clucth petal also doesnt return up as quick as it used to, and when it fully returns to the top it makes a bang noise, which it never used to do.

It once felt like an accurate and precise machine fine tuned to perfection, now it just feels like a clunker and is a chore to drive. I don't have fun driving like I used to, and I avoid driving now.

This all happened years ago, it's still a top priority, and I still want to restore the car back to its former glory. I wish I had thought of coming to Reddit sooner.

**Nothing worked -**

Over the past years I tried everything, I did my own research, I spoke to a mechanic at a local shop, I asked the dealership for help. I got nowhere. At the dealership I wasn't able to speak to a mechanic, only to a service guy, but after trying to explain such a particular problem, he had no idea what could be wrong, and he wasn't able to explain it back to the mechanics. With the mechanic at the local shop that I spoke to and had a test drive with, to him the car drove ‘just fine’. He tried a few things - he checked the air box making sure there were no cracks in the plastic. He manually bleed the clutch, and recommended replacing the rear engine mount - which I did - and it didn't change anything. When he bled the clutch the bite point actually went down quite a bit, but didn't change anything. Eventually he told me that I should get an aftermarket clutch kit and aftermarket engine mounts to get the car to drive ‘how I was describing it’. … even though it used to drive this way with the parts that were already in it.

**Whats been done so far -**

I replaced all of these with OEM parts from the dealer and got them done at a local mechanic:

Did these myself with the approach ""if i replace it all it'll fix it""

Clutch disk pressure plate  
Clutch disk friction plate  
Clutch release bearing and pilot bearing  
Replace manual Honda transmission fluid  
Flywheel comp  
Flywheel pilot bushing  
Clutch slave cylinder  
Clutch master cylinder  
Manually bleeding the clutch

The mechanic recommended and did these:

Replace Rear engine mount  
Checking the air box making sure there was no cracks in the plastic and cleaning it  
Manually bleeding the clutch

Just to throw this in the mix - the car has always had regular maintenance from the dealer, and maintenance schedule was followed. The car has never had problems other than the air conditioning condenser/compressor, which was a recall. The car is and has been in perfect condition and has always been driven responsibly up until the incident. At the time when my best friend drove it that day, it had about 120,000km on the odometer. Now a few years later it has 155,000km and is still driving the same way it was on that day, nothing has changed.

I’ve somewhat given up. I thought of coming to Reddit as a last effort - hopefully these details will help get to the bottom of it. Driving this car used to be such a joy - and I want more than anything to fix it. Any comments or ideas would be very greatly appreciated.

1n4j4qn,Transmission noise - '22 Sentra SR with 6-speed,"Hey all - Canadian here with a 2022  Nissan Sentra SR with the 6-speed manual. Car has 61k kms on it. Runs and drives fine and I've been very much enjoying it so far - bought it used in December (my last car was sadly totaled in an accident with some unseen black ice...) , The Sentra was a lease return being sold by a local highly regarded Subaru dealership.

Thing is, in the last month and a half, I've noticed a noise when I'm driving. If the car is IN gear with my foot OFF the clutch and I am decelerating/coasting, I hear a sort of whirring/very slight rattling noise that sounds like it is coming from the trans.

I also hear the same noise (though maybe a slightly different tone?) if accelerating hard in gear, especially if the driveline is under a lot of load like driving up a steep hill, or if I am going slowly in 6th and accelerate hard. It seems a lot more noticeable under load.

Dealership said they had their Master Tech of 20-something years look at it and says he heard nothing wrong and that nothing is wrong, but I KNOW I'm hearing SOMETHING. Could this somehow just be normal '22 Sentra manual transmission noise?'

I've driven nothing but standard trans cars since 2008 and my prior 2 cars (an '02 Subaru Impreza and an '09 Hyundai Accent hatch) had 200k and 256k kms on them). The Subaru made no similar noise at all, and the Hyundai made a similar noise but VERY quiet which I guess I would think would be normal with a car with that many kms (the transmission had never been opened up in the Accent, was still on it's original clutch and I owned it for 200k of those 256k kms, so I know the noise hasn;t been caused by me driving it wrong as I have a LOT of manual experience).

The Sentra's noise doesn't seem to be getting worse that I can tell (or if it has gotten worse, it might be BARELY louder). Most 'non-car' people that I've asked who have traveled with me can't seem to hear it so it's not that noticeable/loud, but I can definitely hear it if I have the HVAC fan and radio off and the windows up (especially when in gear under load).

When I look this up online, everything seems to potentially point to some sort of bad bearing in the transmission somewhere?

Car still has powertrain warranty, but only until 100k kms and 5 years, so I have 2 years or about 40k kms left on warranty. I'm just worried the dealer will keep claiming nothing is wrong and it'll blow up out of warranty and I'll be out a lot of money for the repair...I wouldn't think I should be hearing anything when the car only has 60k kms on it...

Am I crazy / paranoid?

I'm planning on changing the oil tomorrow in my 2012 Subaru Forester xt. I bought a mobil-1 oil filter but have seen many people talk as if oem is the only sensible choice. Does it really make that much of a difference? Is it worth finding an oem filter or should I just go ahead with the mobil-1 filter?

Secondary question I bought the m1-108 mobil filter as that's the one that was listed as being compatible with the car. There's also the m1-110 which is taller and some people on the interweb say to use this one as it's the same height as the oem filter. What's up with that?

Before 2005, OEM Honda and Subaru oil filters were noticeably better construction and made in Japan. That changed. They're not any better these days.

Having said that, I always get OEM oil filters for two reasons. Asian OEM oil filters all use a glued on D cross section seal rather than a pressed in rectangular cross section seal. Asian OEM oil filters also have a plastic cover to prevent debris from entering the oil filter. I don't know why aftermarket oil filters don't do the same.

I think last year, Subaru was sourcing noname brand oil filters as their OEM oil filters for their dealers in the US. 

If you want to use the JDM OEM oil filters that Subaru uses in Japan, I think you can get them under the Mazda label. I don't know the P/N but I'm sure a Subaru forum will have it."

1n4h4x6,Windshield Fluid Reservoir Air Pocket?,"Hello,

I feel kinda dumb even asking this, but I’ve never run into it before. I’ve got a 2020 Mitsubishi Mirage and the low washer fluid light came on. When I went to top it up, I noticed something weird: there’s fluid at the bottom of the reservoir, and fluid sitting in the filler tube all the way to the top, but a big ol’ air pocket in between. The stuff in the tube just isn’t draining down into the tank, so it looks like the reservoir isn’t actually filling.

Tried poking a straw down there to break it up, did absolutely nothing. Smacked the side of the reservoir a few times too, also nothing.

Anyone know what’s causing this and how to fix it? The low fluid light’s still glaring at me.

Thanks!

The appeal worked and I did not pay. I made it clear that I had intention to pay, but their machine did not work. Feel free to use my excuse if it applies!

1n549jt,How to improve T5 drive quality?,"Hi all, after a bit of advice. Recently picked up a 2006 prefacelift T5. Always loved the front end and wanted a camper now I’ve got a little lad to enjoy together.

It’s going to be my daily drive too and so far I’m struggling with enjoying driving it. It’s the 2.5 174bhp TDI.

Main issues are that it feels quite roll(y) and just very bouncy and at times crashy. I’ve been looking at SoLow spring kits which I’m hoping might help (as well as dropping it slightly which I do think looks good).

I’m also finding it’s quite noisy in the cabin. I’ve read this engine is a bit noisier due to it not having a cambelt. Thoughts are that I can sound proof the bonnet area a little and then otherwise just upgrade the Audio in the cab?

Has anyone got any additional ideas or tips for things theyve done themselves if there’s any transporter owners here.

1n548ag,Classic car restoration pitfalls,"I am currently towards completing the second year of restoring a 1988 BMW e24 6 series 635csi, which was supposed to originally be rolling restoration but turned into a nut and bolt level job once it turned out the shell had botched repairs and needed substantial welding. As I'm reasonably competent with the wrenches and managed to get the welding completed by myself, this was alright other then extending the project time by a fair few months. The past weekend I finally got onto reinstating the front suspension and steering and it feels on track for starting and driving by the end of the month with some luck. Some particular issues I've run into during the project are: the guy who I wanted to come out to weld the car flaked out, I ended up practicing my welding and taking the whole job on myself. I've tried to keep as many parts as practical, and strip, blast, repaint etc. A few times the results weren't perfect and I had to restrip and reattempt until I got it as I wanted it. Parts availability, most recently I struggled for weeks to get decent quality engine mounts.

As I was doing this restoration, I kept looking at forums, YT vids, reddit posts and kept coming across horror stories of cars bought to restore and left to rot for years, restoration shops that take on work and then years later the car is incomplete, or complete the restoration but the job is so shoddy they may as well have not bothered, skyroceting costs etc etc.

Hence, people on here who have completed or are mid-way through a similar project, what are your experiences and stories?

1n4yrpf,Change of work circumstances and reconsidering having a financed car.,"For the last 10 years I have had a field based role and a car allowance to support that. I've always had a PCP deal on a car costing around £350 per month, travelling between 25-30k miles/year.

I had a change of role with my company about 6 months ago and work from home full time. It was a horizontal step salary-wise (slight increase in total) and I was able to negotiate for my car allowance to become part of my gross salary, so it can never be taken off me for if the company changes position on these benefits down the line etc.

The change has been good, I've saved on car insurance/service/wear and tear costs and my car isn't racking up miles. Around the time of my role change, I swapped my car from PCP to HP finance. It would reduce monthly payments from £320 to £250 and I would own the car at the end (though this is over a couple of years longer total). The car is a nicely spec'd 2019 VW GTD golf. I do love it, however it's now feeling like a monthly expense that I don't exactly need. My wife has a 2018 Ford focus that we own outright and we do most of our family driving in. I'm wondering whether I should sell my car to something like webuyanycar (it has about £1200 positive equity atm) and just buy a runaround beater car (petrol) for around £1500. I only do a few short journeys a week in the GTD and have noticed the DPF regen is kicking in more and more often, meaning I need to go for a good 30-45 min drive every week or two just to help clear it.

I'm fortunate to have a base salary of £70k + £10-12k bonus per year. I am married, with kids aged 5 and 2 and a mortgage. My wife and I decided that she wouldn't go back to work after our first was born, if we could make it work. We have been able to make things work but are generally coasting, no big holidays or major expenses. We've had a few ""red line"" scares but nothing that put us into risk of serious debt.

£270 per month isn't life changing but it might help our family finances increase better over time. I grew up in a household with very little and have had financial anxiety most of my life, so I do try not to waste money where I can.

I'm essentially trying to gauge whether it is worth risking things over the next 3-5 years with a beater Vs holding onto the nicer car.

1n4y52f,Repair or replace?,"Good afternoon all,

I have a 2010 Kia Ceed Strike and after detecting a new noise in the car at low speeds, I decided to take the car to the garage. I always take it to a Kia dealer nearby as they have been amazing so far - I am conscious that I am overpaying for the services and repairs. After diagnosing it, it looks like it would need a new steering column and a replacement of rear brakes and disks as they are 85% gone. The quote is around £2.5k including labor.

It is a lot of money for a 15y/o car, as it costed me £2.9k back in 2020. I will try to get a second quote from an independent, local garage. If that quote lowers down the expense significantly, I would be between two minds: repairing it and keeping it another year or two, and then changing it for an EV, or just selling it as it is (without repairing it) and going for the EV. 

Above there is a graph on the yearly expenses of the car (regular yearly services, MOTs, 1x spring replacement, gasket rocket cover replacement due to a small oil leak and consumables like tyres). The trend is clear as every year the cost is higher, and from a financial perspective it could be a “sell and don’t look back”. However it runs really well and only has 98k miles (45k of those by me). I wonder if with the current market prices it would make sense to spend e.g. 1.5k or. 2k (assuming that the second quote is cheaper than the Kia dealer one) and keep it running a bit more and delay the purchase/pcp/leasing of the EV (I still need to figure out what approach I will take for that one).

Any advice is appreciated… Thank you!

1n4w2v3,"First time buyer, any advice?","Hi all,

I’m 37M based in England. I’ve had my licence 20 years but never actually bought a car. Very soon I’ll be in a position to buy a nice used car in cash. Probably £5-10k.
The car would be both a treat for me (I’ve sacrificed a lot recently) and for driving my 3 year old son around. I would also use it to drive to gigs (I do stand-up as a hobby currently).
The problem is I know nothing about the whole process or navigating dealers. I’m also highly impractical (brains not brain).
If I approach a reputable dealer and say I need a car, the cheaper to run and insure the better; preferably manual and be good for travelling; will I be screwed over?
I’m undecided as to what car I’m looking for and would likely be an easy sale (I’ll work on my poker face). But I have noticed some higher end cars are available at what seems like great prices. What sort of car should I look for?
I know this isn’t that much information but advice from a more blokey bloke than me would be amazing.

Duckdivejim (Score: 2): What kind of dealership is it?
What car is it and how old?

2 year old car from a main dealer wouldn’t worry too much.

Anything older.

Take a torch.

Good walk around. Check body work, open door and check doors and inner doors, tyres and alloys. Alloys for scuffs and tyres for condition, matching (same brand) and age. (Not a deal breaker but it’s a cost and a clue if the car has been well loved.

While checking tyres look at brake pads (how much material left) and disc (is it lipped and/or marked)

Interior rips and marks on seats and roof lining) condition of dash and interior buttons, steering wheel.

Underneath the car. Rust, really check for rust. Then check condition of drive shafts (usually at the front sticking out the gearbox and into the wheel hubs) and suspension components (springs going up from the wheel hubs)

Open the boot, look underneath the carpet for rust.

Under the bonnet.

Use your torch and have a general check of engine bay, any oil leaks. Check condition of any visible belts. Fluid levels like coolant and brake fluid.

Check oil level. Withdraw dip stick, wipe dip stick with a rag, re insert dip stick, withdraw dipstick, check oil level is between marks.

Lift oil cap and coolant gap check for milk shake (combination of oil and coolant)

Ask about the service history. Most cars are 12 months or 10k miles whichever is first. Does vary by car so do check make and model. Try and find the service schedule for the car and see if it’s been adhered to.

Run a Vcheck on the car (costs money)

https://www.vcheck.uk

Check MOT history (free .gov service)

https://www.check-mot.service.gov.uk

You can also google the make and model you are looking at and common problems. You can find out if it’s a timing belt it chain and if it should have been changed/ has it been changed. Although that would be covered by service schedule above but it’s worth noting because it can be a big bill.

I’m sure someone will be along to point out something I’ve missed but hopefully this is a good start.

I have a 2001 147 2.0, and it's a fantastic car, and from all accounts, the Giulietta QV is fantastic. Plenty of research & homework, see if you can test drive it - if the history checks out, go for it.

My sunroof also leaked within a month of ownership although that was a quick fix just needed to clear the leak off holes as they were clogged.

Next contender is this 2004 1.6 petrol MK1 Ford Focus Edge. 142K miles

It’s got FSH, with the work in the title done and apparently runs perfectly with only the aircon requiring a regas. I’ll be needing it to drive a 50 mile round trip every couple of days.

1n4o3nh,New Sportage or is there a better alternative?,"We've outgrown our 2016 Peugeot 2008 (and I hate it from the depths of my soul). Need something a little roomier in the back seats and boot.

Although I'd prefer an estate, my wife detests them, so I think we're stuck in small/mid size SUV territory though I'd gladly be wrong. 

Things I like about the new 26 sportage
- looks quite nice these days - much nicer IMO than the Tucson which seems the closest direct comparison 
- hybrid
- meets the space requirements
- 7 year KIA warranty
- in the GT Line trim comes in under the luxury car tax threshold 

Never bought new before, but got burned pretty bad on my current car bought used and have two small kids so thinking new on PCP for peace of mind. 

What do more knowledgeable people think? Is this a decent family car? Is there an obviously better alternative? Am I moron for entering the world of PCP (5.9% APR and £1000 dealer contribution atm).

1n4j3wb,Need advice on accident I had yesterday,"I posted on here talking about it not long ago in fact yesterday, so this is a sort of continuation of that I want a second opinion on what to do. I’ve had a look at my car the damage is basically next to nothing there’s one or two noticeable scrapes down the side which I wouldn’t mind repairing and going down the insurance route but I am also alright with just getting some of that stuff from Halfords and dealing with it myself.  Reason I want a second opinion is that the incident I had was with a taxi driver, the driver in question I have footage on my dash cam of the incident, photos of the taxi number, the reg plate and after doing research I have also found that the car itself is unlicensed and I don’t want to just let it go so I am leaning towards reporting them to the police however I don’t want to make any claims on the insurance front as if he is driving without insurance then that falls back on me and I’m not covered if he isn’t insured. So I’m a bit perplexed as to what to do any claim I make means my premium will more than likely go up which if I can avoid is best for me I’ve only really just been on the road a few months like previously mentioned so sorry if some of my facts or statements might not be correct 

anyone got any advice I don’t want to put myself in a situation where I have to bite the bullet and make a claim if I don’t have to

MrTechRelated (Score: 1): Let’s look through the facts of the situation:

Unlicensed taxi hits you and it’s his fault?

You have a video of the incident, good. 

Most good policies have an uninsured driver protection, but if not you can contact the MIB. 

Your car is an old Yaris, they’ll write it off but likely offer you the ability to keep the car and you’ll receive a payout. 

Your little Yaris will receive a CAT N status which means upon sale it will be worth less, but you’ve already likely profited as you’ve received a payout for the car from the insurance company. 

Your insurance company will state you’re required to inform them of any accidents, and this will raise your rates regardless of claiming so you might as well if you’re going this route. 

Perhaps either post the video (maybe not the best idea if you’re trying to avoid detection by your insurance company) or DM it to me and I can review it for you for a second opinion."
