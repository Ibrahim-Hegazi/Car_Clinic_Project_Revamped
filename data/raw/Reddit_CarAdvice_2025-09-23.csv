1no2h4i,my 2014 honda accord starts intermittently,"2014 honda accord EX-L 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cy| CVT)

whenever you go to start the car sometimes it will start immediately and sometimes it will make no noise other than the lights/ac coming on. it’s been at the mechanic for 4 weeks now and he cannot figure it out. 

what has been replaced: (i apologize i am not a car girl) 

-starter 
-relay 
-had ABS module repaired (all dashboard lights were on and that fixed it) 
-new alternator (nothing to do with the issue just something that was replaced this year)
-new battery 
-they changed out the push start button and it’s connecting wires with a new one 
-he said the brake connection looks good

the mechanic is completely out of ideas. i’d really prefer to not have to take it to a dealership because i’ve had bad experiences with their shops unfortunately. plus he is trying to fix the issue for free after i paid $800 for a new starter and relay that didn’t work.

1no2exw,Rav4 vibrates noticeable more when accelerating on highway,"I have a 2016 rav4 AWD, when driving on the highway and only when accelerating but more particularly when going up hills and around corners, there is a noticeable increase in vibration in the cabin, not an insane amount, but definitely more vibration than there should be and there was before, when I release my foot off the accelerator, the vibration completely goes away, what is the likely problem?

I found one source (RED TEK) that says their HC-12a is compatible with non butyl rubber hoses used in 134a systems. You’re supposed to use 40% of 134a mass in replacement for 134a and also compatible with PAG oil.

	•	OBD2 fuse checked (looks good).
	•	Connectors/pins look fine, no corrosion.
	•	Battery voltage is around 11.9V (on a charger while testing).
	•	Tried manually entering VIN — still won’t connect.
	•	The scanner works fine on other cars, so it’s not the tool.
	•	I replaced the steering wheel lock with an emulator, had the key reprogrammed, and even used a bypass relay — car cranked, but scanning still fails.

Questions:
	1.	Could a SAM (Signal Acquisition Module) be the culprit?
	2.	Is there a specific fuse/module that controls OBD communication I should recheck?
	3.	Does battery voltage need to be higher (12.5+V) for proper communication?
	4.	Any other common causes for these cars not talking to scanners?

Let’s back up here

So if your brake fluid level is low enough that a light is coming on, either you have a massive fluid leak (which you would know because your pedal would sink to the floor) or your brake pads are worn down, and the fluid level has dropped to make up the difference. 

You probably don’t need to flush it.  

Take it to a shop, have them look at the pads, and warn them that you filled the master cylinder full so when they go to compress the calipers back they don’t make a massive mess.

Explosivpotato (Score: 12): You are correct that you accomplished nothing good. Doesn’t mean you accomplished anything bad, though. 

After adding half a bottle, though, you should be able to clearly see the brake fluid level near or at the top of the reservoir. Perhaps use a wooden chopstick as a dipstick to help find the level. 

Brake fluid levels will generally go down as brake linings wear and pistons extend. This is not really a concern at this time - what is of concern is the original root cause of the issue. The “brake” light is extremely variable in function on different cars. You said it only came on under acceleration - does your car have a hand operated parking brake?"

That being the case it can be two things. 1 whoever did the job overfill your engine with oil. 2 there is a high pressure fuel pump on top of the engine, if this fails it will fill your engine with gas/oil and it will make a no start condition but I doubt this is the case since the car is drivable. 

Now to fully answer your question it could be that since the engine is overfilled it could be spitting the oil tru a vacuum hose, or cold air intake. 

Or simply yes, it could be “old oil residue” dripping now. But I highly doubt it."

1nnyznl,Car battery constantly dying,"Hello,
I have a Toyota Rav 4 2017, and I got the battery recall fixed. 

So when I was able-bodied, I drove to work daily and had no troubles. After being disabled, I would only drive 1x-3x weekly mostly, sometimes only 1x in 3 weeks, depending on what I needed. Still no car battery issues yet. A bit later, I got into a head on car accident. Since both of us braked hard, there wasn’t TOO much damage but obviously needed repairs.

I get the car into a good mechanic near me, and when it’s fixed I go home. The next day I try to start my car, and the battery is dead. I get my car back to the shop, and they said it was my dash cam that was plugged in that caused the battery drain. I told them that my dash cam was NOT hardwired, nor did the “cigarette lighter” outlet ran while the car was off.They said sure, but it is a parasitic draw and over a couple weeks or a month it would kill the car battery.

We had to replace the battery FOUR times in 1.5 years (due to the car accident my insurance covered the first, the mechanic covered the second, then 50% off, then I covered it). Just charging the battery (rapid or overnight) wouldn’t actually fix it, because the battery would just be low again the next day (even if the dash cam was not plugged in).

As far as the dash cam goes, I tried only plugging it in when I was actively driving and removing post drive, but they claimed it was still the dash cam. It died two weeks after the last drive.

Alright, that sounds somewhat doubtful but okay. So I completely stopped using the dash cam, and they LITERALLY would not believe me when I said during this battery’s period I did not use the dash cam at all. It was not plugged in ONCE. They claimed that the wires are hidden and they don’t know where else it is plugged in (I am literally the person who installed them. It goes to the front and rear dash cam only, and only has one charging plug, which again wasn’t used at all during that battery’s life).

I know that driving infrequently can also cause problems with cars, but it literally was not a problem before the car repair for 1.5 years, and they said this was caused by my dash cam. The dash cam was plugged in 24/7 before the accident without issues. I’ve taken my car to another shop as well, and they couldn’t find anything wrong else with it (they suggested I idle my car 30 mins 1x weekly, but the battery needed jumpstarting after the 1 week of re-charging and inspection). Alternator was good, etc.

Any thoughts on the matter?",6,1758576075.0,29,MechanicAdvice,1758656066,2025-09-22 21:21:15,2025-09-23 19:34:26,"explosivcorn (Score: 6): It could be parasitic draw, but I don't understand why they are so obsessed about the dashcam.

It’s an RV accessory. 
  It’s stupid that your mechanic keeps saying it’s the dash cam. My dash cam plugs into the in cabin cigarette lighter which doesn’t have power when the car is turned off. Your mechanic is 2 times a dumba** if that’s the case for your car and you said you didn’t use it. Time to find another mechanic dude."

Late-County-4094 (Score: 1): Sounds like you’ve already thrown a lot of parts at it – when a starter bench-tests fine but refuses to turn the engine when installed, it usually comes down to either poor connections or the starter not meshing correctly with the flywheel.



On these older Ford trucks the ground path is critical. Make sure the battery ground strap to the engine block is clean and tight, and that the block-to-frame strap didn’t get left off when you swapped transmissions. High current needs a good return path; a weak ground will let the solenoid kick but the motor can’t deliver torque.



Also double-check that the starter mounting surface and bolts are clean so the starter can sit flush. If there is paint, grime or mismatched bolts it can hold the starter slightly crooked so the bendix gear hangs up in the ring gear. There are also two different tooth counts depending on flywheel diameter; if you’ve swapped drivetrains make sure the starter matches the flywheel.



Finally, verify you’re getting full battery voltage at the large post on the starter while cranking (a worn ignition switch or corroded cable can drop voltage under load). A simple voltage drop test across the cables will tell you if the cables are bad. Good luck – intermittent starter issues are frustrating but it’s usually a wiring or alignment problem, not the engine itself."

As soon as I got to 85 the check engine light turned on. So I slowed down and moved to the slow lane. As soon as I slowed down to 65 the light turned off. Just to see what would happen I put my foot on the gas and the light flickered for a bit before staying on. So I threw my hazards on and go off the nearest exit. 

As soon as I got off the exit the light turned off again. I drove into a gas station, left the car on and popped the hood. It was dark and I don't know much about cars but I didn't see anything weird. No foul smell, no smoke, no weird noises. 

I left the car on and drove back home in the slow lane with my hazards on going no more than 65 mph. I was 40 miles from home (BTW f*ck everyone who saw my hazards and still decided to tail tf outta me in the slow lane. Speed limit was 65 and I was going 60). 

I got home just fine and again popped the hood. Everything looked okay to a novice like myself. I turned the car off. Then turned it back on. When I did it kind of sounded like it struggled just a little bit to turn on. The engine light stayed off ever since it turned off when I was getting off on the exit.

I recently replaced my alternator, the belt, and the battery. Also did an oil change and upgraded from halogen headlights to led. I changed my headlights that day, did the oil change a week prior, and changed everything else a week before that.

I heard that even if the check engine light isn't currently on that the car will save the code so that a scanner can see why it came on when it did so I'll be taking my car to auto zone in a couple hours here but I'm a bit stressed out especially since I just did all that to my car.

1nnwil6,Car eating coolant?,"I have a 2014 Town and Country that just hit 210k miles. Original engine, original tranny, oil cooler is aftermarket (all chinesium from Amazon). I replaced two cams and some rocker arms last fall. Regular oil changes at 5k miles.

I recently had an overheat event at the end of July. Redlined a couple times for a few seconds before a shutdown. Wound up replacing a thermostat and refilling the coolant.

Today, the engine was pulling a little hot (usually sits just over 200, was running stable at 230-235). Went to check the coolant, the radiator was low. Put about half a gallon of premix in the radiator and the rest of the half gallon into the reservoir.

Here's what I've checked so far:
-the crankcase has negative pressure
-there is no evidence of gas leak/bubbling from the radiator
-there is no mayonnaise in the oil galleys. Did a fresh change today, looked dirty and there was some light glitter in the filter but otherwise fine.
-there is no oil visible in the radiator
-i'm not seeing fluid leaks
-there is a squealing noise for the first 5-10 seconds on startup from the serpentine belt

Any clue what might cause the coolant leak/where I should check next?

1nnvqw5,Fuel leak. I assume tank is leaking? Should I go with complete assembly from scrap yard or new aftermarket bare tank? 2003 Lexus ES300,"Noticed smell of gas and a small wet spot near rear of vehicle.

$250 for complete tank with pumps and hoses from scrapyard that is same year and model.

Alternatively the downside on the old tank is it's 20 something years old and not sure yet on the condition.

The balance of the $400 quoted by the dealer is probably an hour of labor, shop supplies, and tax.  The upside for having it done at the dealer is that the diagnostic is already done, and you'll receive some kind of warranty on the parts and labor.

An independent shop might be willing to install the sensor without doing a diagnostic, but with the clear understanding there will be no warranty on the work, and that's if you can find a shop that will do it.  They still might require that the shop source the part, so you're likely looking at $150 to $200 retail for the sensor, and another $100+ to install.

The cheapest way to replace the sensor, short of doing it yourself, is likely to use a mobile mechanic.  A mobile mechanic is also your best chance for finding someone willing to install customer provided parts.  You can get a Denso upstream sensor for your car for about $130 from RockAuto, and I would expect the labor from a mobile mechanic to be maybe $75 to $125 for the install.  Don't expect a warranty there either.

All the prices I've thrown out are just my own rough estimates.  Labor could be a lot higher or a little lower, depending on the cost of living in your area.  The retail parts price can vary even for the exact same part depending on the shop.  You're going to need to call around to find a shop or mobile mechanic willing to work with you, and get the prices directly from them.

Buying the correct upstream sensor will depend on whether the car was built in Japan or USA.  The driver's door jam sticker will tell you the country of origin, or you can go by the first digit of the VIN, J being Japan and 4 or 5 for USA.

I recommend only using OEM Toyota, Denso, or NTK sensors, and purchase it only from the dealer, an auto parts store, or online from an auto parts-only retailer.  Cheap sensors cause problems, and online retailers that aren't exclusively auto parts have been know to have counterfeit products in their systems."

1nntnzy,Advice for Stuck Oil Filter,"Well, I’m… befuddled. 

I have a 1974 Corvette. Bought it a few months ago and I’m finally getting some time to work on it. I go to change the oil and everything is going fine until I get to the filter. The thing is frozen in place. Bad. I’ve tried at least 3 different types of wrenches and pliers and accomplished nothing (other than crushing in the sides of the filter more and more each time). I’ve tried soaking the threads with penetrant (which doesn’t work that well given that I’m spraying upwards), still no luck. 

Another interesting find, when I drained the oil, some sludge came out (but no metal). Makes me think the previous owner(s) knew about this so they just never changed the filter. On a positive note, compression is really good and consistent on all 8 cylinders (checked it just before starting this mess of an oil change). 

If anyone has some insight into a tool or method that might free up this thing, I’m all ears. I’m at the point that I’m about to pull the header so that I can get a chisel or something jammed into the side of the filter and bash it with a hammer in hopes of jarring it loose. But that seems like a last resort kind of thing. So please, someone give me a better idea.

1nntnxt,Oil Filter not fitting,"On the left, is the old oil filter which fit properly. It is a Fram 7317. On the right is a new Fram 7317 but possessively a higher model, so it is still 7317 but designed to be better. The actual length is a bit off, the one on the right, the new one, is about 1/2inch shorter. But I know length is not important.

What seems to be the problem is the thread pitch(not sure if this is the best word) are different. Notice how the thread designs are different. The new one, on the right, will thread properly at first but the oil filter fails to reach to the end, where it touches the engine.

This has happened twice to me. On this Fram filter ordered from Amazon. The first one I returned thinking I got unlucky. This second one has the same issue. I am ordering from Amazon directly, so not a seller on Amazon. I don't think it is a fake product.

Is it possible Fram is incorrect on compatibility?

1nnt33n,Is my Lower Oil Pan safe to drive on or am I just being lucky?,"This weekend I was working on my car 2003 Toyota Highlander V6 AWD. I've had a lower oil pan leak for about like 5years it's small.

This weekend I tried my best to finally address it. Oil change dropped the pan. Removed the existing gasket goo. Clean the mating surface. Apply new goo, and re-install the pan, torqued all bolts to spec and then finished the oil change with filter and 5qts 5w-30.

It drives fine, cleaning out the sediment in the lower oil pan once dropped was really cathartic to finally get that out.

My concern:

1. I ran the good along the outside of the mounting holes not inside. I am worried that it pushed the gasket out of the mounting surface and I am extremely worried.
2. I don't think I waited long enough to let the gasket goo start to set. I remember going and torquing. Then putting only a little in to see if it'll hold oil, not under load.

The next day there is a small drip (maybe I need to rétorque the bolts not that the gasket has set?)

But otherwise drives better than before and there are no issues that I can speak of. No dash lights and there are no problem noises. Am I extremely lucky or is did I succeed in this endeavor. Driving it after the whole process I noticed that it was a little hesitant to stay at operating temp. Always wanted to be a little under.

Please let me know if it's a full send or full tow.

I'm asking because some have longer work times and different amounts of time before you apply full torque, refill the oil or operate the engine.

You won't likely have a catastrophic loss of oil and I wouldn't worry about that.  You might have leak similar to how it was before.

I recommend you get under the engine and wipe it down as best as you can, then place a large clean sheet of cardboard under the engine for a few hours to see if it's leaking.

I don't recommend trying to retorque the pan bolts now.  I don't think it would help, and it might even cause a leak where there would not have been a leak.

lampministrator (Score: 1): Well a new gasket will not affect drivability -- AT ALL.  Unless it leaks all the oil out.  So let's get that ""it drives better"" out of the way.  No it doesn't.  It drives the exact same as before you changed the gasket.  All you are doing is resealing a leak.  This is not major mechanical.  The crank, pitons and cams don't care if there is an oil leak, so long as they get their oil.

OK -- Now to your concern, when changing the gasket, was the oil pan CLEAN and DRY?  Was the mating surface on the block CLEAN and DRY?  I don't mean wiping the oil off with a rag.  I mean cleaning the surface off with a solvent like Brake Kleen? 

Did you use the correct gasket material?  Technically for Toyota you can use grey or black PermaTex but I just go with black because the only difference is temperature.  You didn't use Silicone or anything other than gasket material right?

Generally if you left a 1/8"" bead of gasket material down, it will not matter if you are inside or outside the bolt holes.  It will squish both ways.  I tend to go inside and dab a drop outside of the holes.  A little bit of material goes a long way, considering when sealed there is less than a thousandth of an inch in some cases of a gap.  

If it's still dropping oil, you did something wrong.  Wrong gasket material, not clean and dry, low torque, thin bead, not letting gasket material ""set"" before sealing and adding oil ..   Lots of reasons it still drops oil.

Is it bad that my MAIN concern here, is the thought process that a oil pan gasket could make a vehicle drive better?  I applaud you for taking this simple task on by yourself.  I might suggest continuing education into how the engine works, and get your hands dirty more often ... You learn by doing!"

Do you know/ can you determine if it is coming from the driver or passenger side?

Once you know that, then try to determine if it is coming from where the axle engages with the transmission (unlikely) or where the wheel is (most likely).

I would first look to make sure the brake pads are releasing when they should be, opposed to being continually engaged.  You likely would have felt the car pulling one way if that was the case. If that isn't the issue, then your likely looking at an issue where the axle meets the hub/ wheel.

This should not be too difficult for them to pinpoint given how pervasive the sound is.  I am thinking by now there will also likely be visual signs of wear/ rubbing where there should not be.

After putting everything together, I started the car. It was idling very rough and the rpm dial was fluctuating all over the place. Engine may have been misfiring too.

Scanned engine light code and it read p0336 and p0386 which indicates range performance issue with the A circuit and B circuit of the crankshaft position sensor. 

That sensor was one of the parts i had to unplug and take off to get to the timing cover. So either I didn’t put it back on right, or the sensor is suddenly not working for some reason now? I find it hard to believe I didn’t put it on right because its attached on a plastic bracket that just gets bolted into the timing cover by two bolts. I also find it hard to believe that I damaged the sensor when taking it off and putting it on but who knows.

The kicker is, if I turn everything off, open the hood and stare at it for a moment menacingly, then drop the hood shut and get back in, four times out of five the car then starts right up.

04HondaCivic (Score: 1): I agree that rebuilt titles can be a gamble. If you’re gonna drive it into the ground, can get it fully inspected and you know what happened to cause the rebuilt title, it can be a good deal. 

Throwing that code with that few miles on it is surprising.  I see that in high mileage cars that have the original cats. Maybe it’s an 02 sensor. It could be a number of things but unless you have it looked at by a mechanic and diagnosed there’s no way to tell. 

These vans are solid. I have a ‘16 with 140k+ miles on it and the only thing I’ve done besides basic maintenance is a sensor of some sort that took me 5 minutes to replace. I don’t even know what sensor it was now. If all that was replaced was a bumper, I’d make sure the price reflects the salvage title and the cost to get that code taken care of and I’d go for it. I don’t know what these vans are going for with good titles, that year and mileage so I don’t know if $9.5k is a good price for a salvage title. 

Edit: I just looked. It looks like that generation is going for $15k+ for the ones with 100k miles and less. $10k for the ones north of 140k miles. So 9.5k for a salvage titled 110k van could be a very good deal provided that code is a simple fix and there’s nothing seriously wrong with it because of the salvage title."

I've driven it for about 2 years now and I absolutely love it. 

I just brought my car in for an oil change at the nearest Valvoline cuz it was getting low and I was thinking I've been using the AC pretty much everyday for the summer now (I know I'm quite indulgent) so maybe there's some cooling fluid they might need to replace or something.

Because I love my AC and want it to be good... I wish I knew at the time that the car AC is a closed system that isn't generally replaced often. If my pressure was actually low wouldn't they need to find out where I had a leak or something?

So they did their Freon recharge thing and now they're saying that my AC compressor is actually blown and that's why my AC doesn't work and it's blowing hot air. Well I told them that my AC was working just fine before they did this, never had any problems of it blowing hot air. And so I've been sitting in the waiting area for 2 hours now and they're just saying my AC compressor is broken and I asked if the compressor had been spinning before they started recharging the freon and they said it's not normal practice to see if the compressor is spinning before they recharge it. I also asked if they checked the compressor was functioning when they vacuumed it down and checked the pressure and made sure there weren't any leaks before ""recharging"" it and they said they generally don't do that before they start recharging. 

They tried recharging the freon a second time and said maybe when the pressure is up it will start again but it didn't work and then they just sent me on my way and didn't charge for the service but now I don't have working AC.

1nnzfxj,Am I the asshole for my dispute with my local shop?,"Honestly asking for thoughts from other autobody mechanics out there and any advice would be appreciated.

  
14 months ago I hit a deer with my 2016 F150. It pushed in the bumper a bit, cracked the plastic grille, and dented the fender a bit. I took it right away to my local autobody shop and made a claim. I've taken things to him before and he always has done good work. I could never tell it was damaged after so I was always happy with the result. The downside of this guy is he makes me wait FOREVER to get it in.

  
Well he told me it would take About 2.5 months to get it in. I was willing to wait. My insurance paid out the estimate and after many calls, finally, 14 months later he took it in. He even admitted he was moving people ahead of me. I thought that was shitty but that's not what I'm complaining about here. It's relevant though.

  
Well When I finally get my truck back (1 day of repairs) I see the fender isn't fixed. I show him the damage and he tells me it wasn't on the estimate. We go inside and he pulls up the claim. I show him on the photos he took that the damage was there. He basically says it he didn't put it on the estimate and good luck getting the insurance to pay for it now 14 months after the fact. it will cost 900+ to replace the fender.

  
I told him I wasn't happy with that. I took it to him to fix and wanted it completely fixed. His position is I should have reviewed the estimate and checked his work. He refuses to fix it now and eat the money to repair it on his own. The most he will do is try to hammer out the dent from the aluminum fender and ""Most shops wouldn't even do that. I'm just doing that for you to save face. Clearly you think it's partially my fault."" This is after he told me that you really can't repair aluminum panels like that and need to replace them.

My position is, I took it to him to fix, I showed him the area that the damage was in. My insurance company doesn't send me a copy of the estimate submitted them from him (At least I don't think they did but that was 14 months ago so I may be wrong) and I don't think I should be out a grand to fix it either because he didn't add it to the report but still documented it in the pictures. I'm not a mechanic and it shouldn't be on me to double check his work to make sure he did it right after I showed him the issue.

  
In the end someone is out a grand and I don't believe it should be me and I think he should stand by his work. If he refuses I acknowledge I'm just boned. I'm not going to take him to small claims over a grand and the dent isn't that unsightly.

Am I the asshole here? And does anyone have any advice for me here or am I just fucked? Would most shops really just tell me to go pound sand like he said?",0,1758577199.0,16,mechanic,1758656066,2025-09-22 21:39:59,2025-09-23 19:34:26,"Reasonable-Matter-12 (Score: 3): Typical bs from the paint huffing meth goblins.

He flushed the fluid two times and replaced coil packs due to the error code P0300. Problem is still happening. When the car accelerates it and doesn't let off the gas, transmission shifts normally.

Car has been well maintained over years. Mileage is at 95,000. 

Just had front & back brake pads changed (everything was checked & serviced, calipers, pins, etc. no rocks stuck in anywhere) 

Passenger side axle was replaced twice because mechanic was worried first one was a defect after hearing this noise. It was not the axle. 
This noise actually started happening after I changed my rear brakes & front right tire. 

My oil light was never reset, hence the wrench lit up on dash. So the car thinks it is “overdue for maintenance “. But I have some more miles to go with the oil. 

This car was looked at multiple times, and the answer is still unknown. This has been going on almost a month. 

The weird part, after I drive for about a minute, it goes away. Once the car is off & sits for a few hours, and I go to drive it again, it makes this noise. I usually floor it to get it “past” it and it works. I can drive for 6 hours following & it will not do it again. 

When it’s happening, I do feel a sort of vibration under the car, and kind of some resistance, but it still goes. 

The ONLY thing that was mentioned, is that someone thinks there may be something loose inside of the transmission, because of an indent in the middle of the dipstick. I did my research, and found that’s normal. The mechanic is saying it is very sharp, and feels like it is being filed down. Honda transmissions are all internal so there is no way to actually get in there.

I’d also like to say, there were a few days when I went to go start my car in the morning, pull off, and it did NOT do this. This was only a couple days though, most days it does make this noise.

I ran the audio through chatgpt. Lol heres what it came up with.

Likely causes (ranked) Fuel injectors — modern injectors make a rapid, consistent “ticking” that is fairly high-pitched and regular. The regularity and high-frequency content match this. Valve train / lifter tick (valve lash or hydraulic lifter issue) — also common and sounds like a metallic tick; timing typically follows RPM and may be slightly less regular than injector clicks. Exhaust leak at a flange/manifold — can make a sharp “tick” on the exhaust stroke; usually louder under load and may change with throttle. Less likely from the recording: rod knock or main bearing knock — those are lower-frequency, deeper, and usually less “spike-like” and more of a thump. I don’t see strong evidence of that in the spectrogram."

Key point is that you are within 3% of matching tire rotations so Speedo and safety systems are typically unaffected. Nicely done. 

With a larger sidewall vs rim, typically a softer ride for the larger bumps, however this can be bouncy even. More flex in corners (not ideal).

Footprint and contact surfaces are typically reduced. Dry/wet traction reduced for acceleration, braking and corners. Inverse on snow as the narrower tires can cut through to the pavement with more weight per sq inch to increase traction. 

Tire type, rubber setup, design and tread all play a role so unless you're putting the exact same brand/model this is a generalization. People changing from one brand or model tire even on the same size can see drastic differences. 

Reminder even changing, you also need to make sure your sidewall load index remains within OEM. This is the maximum weight including added braking force. There is a three digit number that corresponds to the weight per tire and you want to match or exceed.

1no20bv,Please help ): 2014 Volkswagen Passat,"Hey everyone!

First want to thank you for taking the time to read, and potentially offer advice.

So for the backstory, my 2014 Volkswagen Passat had battery issues and thus was sidelined in my garage for about 2 weeks. I fixed the battery issues and then was taking her for a drive around town, when I noticed the coolant warning light come on. The engine was not noted to be overheating, it was well below the halfway 190 mark on the dashboard. And I’ve never had any coolant issues prior to this.  

I took the car home and found the coolant to be completely empty. So I buy more and go to replace it, and I notice the coolant instantly dripping out of the engine and underneath the car. It took only a few minutes for all the coolant that I just put in to have dripped out completely, so a significant leak. 

I took her to a mechanic this week hoping (more like praying) it was just a hose issue, as this leak was non-existent before being sidelined for 2 weeks, and it was such a severe leak. Turns out it’s my water pump having a significant leak, and the mechanic recommended replacing.

My question to you all regards the fact that they also recommended me replacing the thermostat and gasket at the same time, which is estimated to me as $630 in addition to the water pump. 

So my question is: what is the necessity level of replacing the thermostat and gasket at this time? 

I’m still in training and this is already a huge, unexpected expense, and it’s estimated to be about $2000 total with the thermostat/gasket replacement included in that. I understand the recommendations for replacing at the same time, but this being more affordable is a necessity for me at this time. 

Of note, my car had not over heated when found to have low coolant, leading to finding the significant leak, and has not been driven since. So my car has not overheated at all during this period, which I understand could have damaged the thermostat.

1no0s9p,Warning: PartsAvatar Canada refuses to honor their own return policy — even with dealer proof,"Just a heads-up to anyone considering ordering from Parts Avatar. I had a really frustrating experience with them over a simple set of brake calipers.

I ordered calipers for a **2002 Toyota Camry SE V6**. The boxes were labeled correctly for the SE calipers, but inside:

* The **right-hand caliper** was correct for the SE (measured and confirmed).
* The **left-hand caliper** was misboxed — it was the smaller LE/4-cylinder version.

So I ended up with **two completely different sized calipers** in boxes that were supposed to match. This is a misboxed item problem, plain and simple.

Here’s the kicker:

* Their own return policy states that in cases of *“Damaged on Arrival, Defective, or Website Error,”* they issue a **prepaid return label, which they are refusing to do.**
* I provided photos and **official documentation from the original Toyota dealer** showing my car is in fact an SE and I correctly ordered the parts I wanted, regardless of the vehicle in my driveway.
* Despite this, after a series of emails, their only response has been: *“Our VIN decoder shows your car is an LE.”*

They’ve ignored the fact that I literally received two different sized calipers in the same order — one correct, one incorrect. That has nothing to do with VINs or trim levels. It’s a warehouse/packaging error, and they simply refuse to acknowledge it.

I’ve since bought the correct caliper from another vendor. But it’s clear:

I have a 2011 Fiat Ducato van with a 120hp 2.3l 4 cylinder engine. It's a 6 gear gearbox and it has 320k km's. A while back I was driving away from a traffic light when the wet sole of my shoe slipped of the clutch a bit while changing gears to second gear. It started grinding and I quickly pressed the clutch better, I think it was only up halfway from where is usually grabs on to fully up before I managed to press it back in again. After this the problems started.

I noticed the following:
- Shifting while stationary with running engine and clutch down is easy through all gears.
- Shifting up while driving usually is not a problem.
-Shifting down while driving, especially when braking is extremely hard, but when I rev match it slides in fine.

I also tested some thing
-Stationary with running engine and clutch down into reverse goes without issues so I suppose the clutch is releasing well 
-Front wheels off the ground in first gear with clutch down still rotates them a bit so maybe the clutch is not releasing well?

As soon as I got to 85 the check engine light turned on. So I slowed down and moved to the slow lane. As soon as I slowed down to 65 the light turned off. Just to see what would happen I put my foot on the gas and the light flickered for a bit before staying on. So I threw my hazards on and go off the nearest exit. 

As soon as I got off the exit the light turned off again. I drove into a gas station, left the car on and popped the hood. It was dark and I don't know much about cars but I didn't see anything weird. No foul smell, no smoke, no weird noises. 

I left the car on and drove back home in the slow lane with my hazards on going no more than 65 mph. I was 40 miles from home (BTW f*ck everyone who saw my hazards and still decided to tail tf outta me in the slow lane. Speed limit was 65 and I was going 60). 

I got home just fine and again popped the hood. Everything looked okay to a novice like myself. I turned the car off. Then turned it back on. When I did it kind of sounded like it struggled just a little bit to turn on. The engine light stayed off ever since it turned off when I was getting off on the exit.

I recently replaced my alternator, the belt, and the battery. Also did an oil change and upgraded from halogen headlights to led. I changed my headlights that day, did the oil change a week prior, and changed everything else a week before that.

Car has been well maintained over years. Mileage is at 95,000. 

Just had front & back brake pads changed (everything was checked & serviced, calipers, pins, etc. no rocks stuck in anywhere) 

Passenger side axle was replaced twice because mechanic was worried first one was a defect after hearing this noise. It was not the axle. 
This noise actually started happening after I changed my rear brakes & front right tire. 

My oil light was never reset, hence the wrench lit up on dash. So the car thinks it is “overdue for maintenance “. But I have some more miles to go with the oil. 

This car was looked at multiple times, and the answer is still unknown. This has been going on almost a month. 

The weird part, after I drive for about a minute, it goes away. Once the car is off & sits for a few hours, and I go to drive it again, it makes this noise. I usually floor it to get it “past” it and it works. I can drive for 6 hours following & it will not do it again. 

When it’s happening, I do feel a sort of vibration under the car, and kind of some resistance, but it still goes. 

The ONLY thing that was mentioned, is that someone thinks there may be something loose inside of the transmission, because of an indent in the middle of the dipstick. I did my research, and found that’s normal. The mechanic is saying it is very sharp, and feels like it is being filed down. Honda transmissions are all internal so there is no way to actually get in there.

I’d also like to say, there were a few days when I went to go start my car in the morning, pull off, and it did NOT do this. This was only a couple days though, most days it does make this noise.

So I'd like to ask here for opinions.

2015 Nissan Sentra, 160k miles, Automatic transmission, unsure of engine size. 

I've driven this car for nearly 6 years now, I own it, it's mine, I'm not renting it. The other day, I noticed it beginning to rattle a little bit, sluggish acceleration. I was only driving it a short way that day, so I figured maybe it was a slight hiccup. 

The next day it began to rattle a lot more, the acceleration was even more sluggish, and I didn't feel safe driving it. I also noticed that my check engine light was going off, flickering.

All of my research points to it being an issue with that catalytic converter, but I do not know how to tell that for myself. As such, I would like to request opinions based on what it could be. Whether it's a misfire due to bad spark plugs, the catalytic converter, something with the ignition coil, you name it. I just want to know. 

I haven't had the chance to get it somewhere to get codes ran, because I have very little money at the moment and don't want to get it towed somewhere just to be charged a fee for storage or something that I won't be able to pay. I also really don't know if I should be driving it at all in that case, so between not wanting to have it towed somewhere and not wanting to drive it for fear of making the situation worse, I'm concerned now.

My current plan is to, once I have my next paycheck, as this caught me out of the blue, have it towed somewhere after surveying my options, and see what needs to be done, and I'd like to be informed on the decision, hence my asking here.

1no232m,Test drove a 2018 Civic Sport Plus 1.5T. Worth £15k?,"Hey folks,

I posted last week about my plans and some Civic options.

Today I went for a test drive in a 2018 1.5T Sport Plus, manual, 42k miles. Car felt solid overall. It’s black, so of course the paint shows some wash swirls and a couple of very small scratches, but nothing major.

Price is £15k, comes with 6 months warranty (I can extend it another 18 months for +£499 — worth it?). Dealer is a Nissan approved.

Car has a Scottish plate, but it went through RAC inspection and the latest MOT shows no rust advisories (or any other advisories). Should I be extra cautious about anything rust-related in this case? If so, what should I specifically check?

Couldn’t test it on the motorway unfortunately, only local roads.

Do you guys think this is overpriced for what it is?

1nnzbwy,Address squeaking brakes,"Hi all,

This will be somewhat of a long-ish advice seeking post. I am an absolute noob when it comes to cars and maintenance (I only passed and started driving in April) so any help at all would be very much appreciated.

For context, the car I bought after passing was a 2015 Mk5 Mondeo. I bought it at 67k miles and have now driven it to 72k miles. Around the tail end of June I started getting a squealing sound when I braked. I took it to a local garage who replaced the rear brake pads and discs as they were worn. They also mentioned that the calipers were hard to take off and ""seizing"" (with video 'evidence' of them being hard to remove) and mentioned that these may need to be replaced as well but ultimately they mentioned that they just cleaned them and that they should be fine for the time being.

After replacing these pads and discs the car was driving fine and the squealing was gone until about two weeks ago. This time the squealing appeared to come from the front. I took it to a different garage who inspected the wheels and confirmed that the front pads needed to be replaced; no mention of the discs. They replaced the pads. The sound was resolved for a day but then I started getting a louder squeal, this time again while braking but also at slow speeds after braking, and seemingly from the back but I wasn't sure. I took it back to the garage who, after inspection, mentioned that all the brake pads were fine, but they noticed that the rear calipers were getting stuck and could be the cause.

They cleaned/greased it for free and I was on my way. However, the squeal was only resolved for a day, and it came back. However, this seemed intermittent. For example, I drove from Manchester to Liverpool over the weekend. On the way to Liverpool the squealing started a few minutes after leaving the M62, basically as soon as we started braking within the city. However, for some reason there was no noise on the way back from Liverpool. Today, however, the car has been squealing for most of the day since I was commuting in start/stop traffic. After getting out I also noticed that the rear left brake discs were also quite hot compared to all the others.

Given all the above information, I would like your help to suggest on what to do next. Do I need to get the calipers replaced? I have heard this can be quite expensive so don't want to do so unless absolutely necessary.

Thanks in advance for your help all.",3,1758576915.0,7,CartalkUK,1758656066,2025-09-22 21:35:15,2025-09-23 19:34:26,"Startinezzz (Score: 1): Sounds like the calipers do need changing.

ChanterburyTales (Score: 1): Based on all that and you saying that your rear left brake felt hotter, it sounds like the brakes are sticking/binding and the caliper will either need rebuilding or replacing.

The brake caliper will have a piston and slider pins which can corrode, as well as seals/dust boots which can wear and allow dirt to get trapped and bind things up.

A garage will likely need to either replace the calipers or rebuild them with new seals, depending on the level of corrosion.

Take the cambelt cover off completely. You need to inspect both the outside and inside of the belt. Often the signs of failure will be between the teeth on the inside. You need to be careful to spot it. Imagine folding the belt along the gaps of the teeth and seeing any separation. This will give you an idea of what you're looking for.

Turn the engine over with the key momentarily. This will rotate the engine a bit, allowing you to inspect another section of belt. Repeat until you've inspected the full belt.

Look for writing on the outside of the belt. Belts from brands like Gates have a datecode.

You can inspect the belt, but it's also possible for a waterpump failure to kill a perfectly good belt/engine.

If you're in doubt then you should probably replace it. Then again, it's a 2006 ranger. You could timing belt roulette it like I did with regular inspections.

Now there are still modern (2018-2020) Alhambras, however given that low mileage examples are almost £20k I feel as if that is waaayy too much considering they are lacking in modern day spec, LED headlights etc. But other than that it's still perfect for my use.

I have however come across the Ford S-Max which seems to be a similar vehicle type, with 3 individual seats in the second row, which fits my needs and it's also fairly modern, led drls, better infotainment screen, digital dials etc. Considering I can spend around £20k, low mileage, get a more highly specced car with and (what it looks like) more than enough space for 3 adults, it feels like a no brainer?

1nns4uz,"3 tall freaks a dawg and a normal, sized wonderfully, tolerant, patient suffering wife","The lease car goes back shortly (thank God!) and I need to replace it.

Tall family + dog = legroom and boot space are non-negotiable. I’m 6’4” in the driver’s seat, and I regularly have two 6-footers in the back, so saloons are out. Estate or SUV is fine — I prefer estates for space, but a taller SUV might be better for getting in and out.

I’ve tried a Q3 — too small. A Q5 is out of my price range, and the Karoq didn’t feel any bigger. I’m looking at cars with around 70,000 miles max.

Thanks to my newly acquired, life-changing arthritis (cheers COVID), it has to be an automatic. I do ~8–10k miles/year — mostly daily driving with the odd longer trip. I'm open to petrol or diesel, whichever makes sense. I’ve owned plenty of diesels before with no real issues (apart from a dual mass flywheel and cleaning an EGR valve myself).

I’d like a bit of oomph, but nothing silly, and without daft running costs.

Here’s where I’m at:

Ruled out: BMW 3 Series (too tight on space), Mercedes (running costs too high), BMW 5 Series (same reason).

Maybe: Audi A6 — worth a look?  Quality issues seem common?

Shortlist: Skoda Octavia vRS Estate, Skoda Superb Estate at the moment.  


For context, my wife has a Kia Sportage which we like — good ride, decent space.  I'm not allowed another.

You've obviously been a bit cheeky in so far as you've avoided the 3rd service hoping to get away with it on a technicality in that it's 1 day before it's 3rd ""delivery date"" birthday. It's worth noting though that service intervals are usually tied to date of first registration, so the date you took delivery may not be relevant. E.g if they registered it on 21st July then the 3rd annual service would have kicked in on 21st July this year. 

But they're a lease company and they're bound by their T's and C's, so if it doesn't state anything regards the expectation of that service been done if transfer of ownership is within the service window timeframe then that's on them.

Watch out for failing LEDs, the rears on the VH (except for Vanquish) all share a flawed design that can catch water and kill them. There is a whole industry of people rebuilding the things because they are so damned expensive to replace.

1nni80c,Better car for long journeys,"I’ve always loved cars and I’ve had a couple of nice ones over the years but for the last 18 months I’ve been driving a 2019 Suzuki Swift 1.2 that I started using when we had a child and we got a bigger car for my wife to run around in. 

I do 57 miles each way to work 3 times per week, sometimes 4 times. It’s usually on weekends when there is no traffic but occasionally the journey home can take 1.5 hours in traffic. 

I’d really like something more comfortable, and automatic, to make the journey less annoying. The swift is absolutely screaming at dual carriageway speeds and road & engine noise means I can’t even hear my podcasts without cranking the radio up to horrible volumes. 

The car is a bit battered now bodywork wise, we’ve had it since new, it’s on around 60k miles, with full history (some Suzuki). 

It’s probably only worth £6k on a good day, if we’re lucky. It’s faultlessly reliable and has cost us very little to run over the last 5-6 years, does 48 to the gallon and it’s generally hassle free. 

I don’t want to borrow any money for the next car so the budget would be only what we could buy with what we get for the swift. Anything I’d like to consider replacing it with would likely be much older, less reliable and cost more to run. I’m okay with paying a bit more for maintenance but replacing it with something like a 13 year old 320d/C Class/insignia or the like, while more comfortable just seems silly at this point. 

Can anyone suggest anything suitable for me given my criteria that perhaps I haven’t thought of?

So recently decided to go and visit a friend in Sardinia, Sadly my Land Rovers are both part way through extensive restoration and I wasn't willing to risk them getting damaged until the work is complete.. Enter in Autotrader late one night and a vauxhall Zafira pops up. My exact thoughts where it's crap and it will be perfect. So having paid for it and discovering it comes with an engine and gearbox warranty. (Not that I think that really means anything) I though I'd share my experience as what I've described as ""One of the cars of all time"" and ""Offsensively non descript"" 

Since buying it I've put about 4000 miles on it and apart from a slight issue with the electrics that's just a damp fuse relay it's been perfectly reliable.  Driven it on Sardininan Mountain roads on trails,Done about 105ish on the Autobahn for an extended period, Had 6 passengers in it for a night out in good but not great comfort. Even moved a donkey for a friend in the back around a farm. It's been unexciting but decent. Yes its not been a fun sporty drive. Yes lack of cruise control made the Roads of France painful. However It's chugged away and done everything I've asked of it for a cheaper car that only ticked over a 100000 somewhere in Luxembourg it could have been a lot worse. It's picked up some fresh dins and dents from French Drivers but that's just proven why I wanted it. I think sometimes we get so caught up in our niche we forget the day to day boring cars can be capable as many things. No Mod cons or flash screens just a car, lights, Engine and gearbox and some vents that claims to be for the AC. So a good stripped down experience. It's been versatile and as the restoration work keeps taking longer I'll hang on to it at least until the MOT.  Although I will be glad to get back behind a landy steering wheel again I've enjoyed the freedom of not caring. Also being below 1.9m was a life saver on the continent. Keep forgetting that part.  If it continues to  behave may even end up at something such as the Festival of the Unexptional as lets be honest it's a Zafira how unexcptional can you get?
