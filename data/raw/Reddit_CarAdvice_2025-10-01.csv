Hello so recently, I had to replace my head gasket and I had to get the heads resurfaced so I had to take it apart and that wasn’t a problem but now I’m trying to put this back together and the intake rocker arms.

It’ll pop itself back up or one side will pop up the only thing I can see binding it or stopping it is the valves because they need to be adjusted so I unscrewed the valves all the way, so it gives it room, but it still won’t go down. any ideas on why this is happening? I zip tied the rockers to put them back on easily but even that didn’t work. This is the best I could get them in the pictures. I really don’t wanna keep messing with them.

All you can do is tighten the bolts down evenly and make sure everything is squared, and you will have to put more pressure on some bokts to get them all the way down. And retorque all bolts aftef they are all down.

Even after a new clutch the car would struggle to bite (only the first) gear. It would vibrate when it gets to the biting point and struggle for a few seconds before it actually moved forward like it should. 

I ignored it but one year later the clutch started to slip and I found out it was worn out in one year of use, so I replaced the clutch, flywheel, and slave cylinder etc. The mechanic said it could be the clutch master cylinder, and how the slave cylinder and may not be disengaging properly. 

So I changed the master cylinder, installed a braided clutch like because I read it helps.

It helped a little but it still didn’t fix it. However it went back to how it was soon after (2-3 days).

I thought it was a little odd considering it’s such a young car, but my dad insisted it was great, despite previously bashing cars I liked for mileage that made sense relative to their year.

Sticker price was $27,000 including limited warranty, free oil changes & wheel rotations, and loaner cars during servicing. I was told by my dad that it’s a great deal, though I was skeptical since he was way up the dealer’s butt the whole time. Just earlier he’d bashed cheaper limited warranty plans that weren’t added to the sticker price yet covered the same mileage and timeframe.

 Anyway, enough context. On the docs, it listed that the radiator core and cabin air filter failed inspection. There was no indication on the post-inspection service records that it was fixed. I kept asking the saleswoman, to which she gave clueless answers, stating that a line that read “clean air box” was likely the solution to the radiator cap failure. The two have nothing to do with each other. She just kept assuring me that it was fixed, which my parents joined in on, stating it was likely fine. 

 Fast forward a week, I had my mechanic friend look at it. He removed the radiator cap and said it smelled somewhat burnt. He said it’d be fine for now, but to keep a close eye on the heat gauge warning light. A week later, I noticed my car was struggling to accelerate. It was abnormally loud despite only lightly pressing the pedal to keep a constant speed. I swore I had somehow switched modes by accident, but that wasn’t the case.

Additionally, I noticed a loud staticky electrical buzzing noise coming from inside the cabin, persistently buzzing the whole way home. Might know what it is, but I want to get outside input.

1nurb58,Oil Leak after dealership service,"TL;DR: need advice on whether to push for more inspection of engine damage or other internals due to an oil leak caused by the dealership's service (they didn't replace the oil filter seal). DTC code P0524

full story:

I own a '22 sonata N line. I just had my oil changed at a Hyundai dealership, but apparently they messed up and my car started leaking oil shortly after. I didn't notice this because it was dark outside - so I have no clue at this point in time. 

Well... I ended up driving over 250 miles back to my home city the following day. When I arrived I even noticed grease coated the back of my car but didn't put 2 and 2 together. 

Next day the check engine light comes on. That's the first sign of trouble. So I immediately go to the nearest auto store to get the code checked, and by the time I get there the oil light comes on too. They tell me to take it to the hyundai dealership ASAP to avoid engine damage. Luckily there's one just down the street - the one I usually go to. 

They notice the leak immediately, so I decide to leave the car there so when the tech comes in the next day they can look for damage. 

Local dealership is saying there's no codes and no damage and they fully re-did the oil change. They determined that the other dealership forgot to change the old oil filter seal and that's what caused the leak. Also, they checked the old oil for metal shavings and such and did not find anything. I was *particularly* concerned about the check engine light more than the oil light, but they said that that's normal for Hyundais (?).  

I am worried about accepting the car as-is as I don't want to be liable for any future expensive repairs due to the other dealership's negligence. 

Should I ask for any other specific inspection(s)? Can I be confident that my car is still in good condition and that this won't turn into an expensive problem later on?

I’d probs be more worried about what relative compression looks like. But realistically you should have called the dealer and had it towed or got them to tow it once you realized it was leaking oil and had low oil pressure. That was a very large mistake to drive it I’m almost sure the dealer would have towed it for you."
1nur9gi,Subaru Transfer Case dying.,"I've got a 2016 Subaru Crosstrek with a five-speed manual. A couple of weeks ago, I started getting a noise at speed. It's kind of a ""ringing hum"", if that makes sense. It gets more intense as I go faster. I tried pushing in the clutch pedal at speed and revving the engine; this did not change the sound at all. In my mind, that eliminated engine issues. I was thinking wheel bearing, although the sound did not change during hard cornering when one would be putting more or less load on the wheels (and bearings) to one side or the other. So, I took it to an indie shop. 

Their conclusion, after a test drive then putting the car on the rack and using a stethoscope, was that the transfer case was dying. They quoted me around $5800 for the entire transmission to be replaced, which brings me to my first question. Would it be possible and/or reasonable to change just the transfer case? A little bit of Googling suggests that on a manual Crosstrek (but not on the automatics), the two can be separated and serviced individually. Obviously a good mechanic probably knows better than some rando on Google (me), however.

Now, as I was getting ready to leave the shop and drive a couple of blocks back to the house, the guy said that I should also replace the clutch if we had the transmission out. I completely agree, but I assumed that was already included in the quote he gave me. I had too much sticker shock to think about asking for the price including the clutch.

1nur7v9,Big project and I dont know what I can do without help.,"So I have a 2003 Honda Civic D17A2 (manual) and it's hasn't ran in atleast 6 years. I've decided to try and fix it and ive got a general idea as to what's wrong, but I dont know what I can do by myself at my current skill level (generally mechanically inclined but without much knowledge), what I need to wait for my dad to do, and what I need to take it into a mechanic for. 

now for the list of issues;
●All fluids (oil change, transmission fluid, coolant)
●New wheels
●Break pads
●Spark plugs (probably?)
●Check and replace fuses
●Replace battery
●Disconnect and rewire radio and subwoofer
●I think the wheels are angled? like this:  /   \
●steering wheel/column got locked up and misaligned?

I know I can do fluids by myself and theres no way I can fix the angled wheels myself, but I need some advice when It comes to the stuff inbetween. Would I be able to figure most of it out? Is there anything I shouldn't touch at all? Should I do these in a specific order?  Am i missing an issue that probably popped up in the time its been sitting? Does anyone know what happened to the steering? Answers to those would be nice but I kinda just need to know if ill end up seriously risking myself or the car if I try fixing the wrong thing.

I know this is super broad and its a long post (SORRY) but I didn't really know where else to post to ask for advice on this.

I'll inevitably have this thing fixed but when it comes to the people I can ask for help they'll just take over and I won't learn anything. This is a great opportunity for me to learn how cars work (which i REALLY want to get into) so I want to do what I can on this thing before my lack of knowledge and skills precedes me.

In 2020 My mom purchased a 96 month Extended Warranty/Wrap Warranty for her Nissan Versa Note (hatchback version). Recently her rear hatch stopped working and a garage diagnosed it as a failed actuator mechanism. The garage tried to claim the repair through warranty however it was denied. 

From what I'm understanding (although I still have to confirm) it seems they're rejecting the claim as the hatchback Versa Note technically has a tailgate door actuator instead of a trunk actuator as spelled out at the end of 'Electronic High Tech'. My interpretation is that the intent is to cover any actuator at the rear of the vehicle, and they just didn't include that specific language. Especially because it seems like a weird place to draw the line considering the other components listed.

  Warranties are inclusive or exclusive.  Including meaning “here is a list of things we cover”, excluding being “we cover these systems except xyz”.

  You have an including warranty and the downside is any part that is hyper specific to a brand or model is t going to be listed. 

  You may be able to argue the latch is covered and the actuator is part of the latch or whatever the case may be, but most aftermarket warranty companies are not flexible.

But the OEM extended warranty, OEM of a different manufacturer, the warranty of the dealer group or lastly a reputable aftermarket which is pretty much just fidelity/JM&A.

Maybe there are some models/engines where the oil could get somewhere difficult to clean, but even then the mechanic should do something to keep it from getting there.


If its actively leaking, presumably from the drain plug, that's a much worse problem that the mechanic probably shouldn't have let out of the shop.

To my understanding gen 3 units are self enclosed and the inner races are held together by a lock ring.

1nul0i0,Bad wheel bearing or something else?,"2007 Ford Fusion SE v6

When I bought the car from a buddy of mine, it was making noise that I thought was a bad wheel bearing on the passenger side, so I replaced the hub assembly on that side (as well as a few control arms on both sides). In hindsight I should've just spent a little more and done the whole front end suspension but I didn't know that at the time.

2 years later, I'm doing an oil change and noticing axle grease leaking from the boot in my CV axles, so I replace both of those (DIY, with the help of YouTube and a couple of friends). Reassembled everything, but now the car is making a noise similar to a bad driver side wheel bearing. Humming noise that gets more constant / loud when turning slightly right, and you can even hear it going straight a lot of times. So I jacked the car up and checked for play (3-9 o'clock, 6-12oclock) and felt nothing. Spinning the wheel by hand I couldn't spin it fast enough to tell anything definite.

So I'm wondering if the driver side wheel bearing is messed up and replacing the CV axles just made the issue more known? Or maybe it was because I didn't get an alignment after doing the CV axles? Like I said, DIY mechanic so I'm going off of YouTube and various forums. Oh, and if it helps I didn't torque the axle nuts AT FIRST, after driving it briefly I realized I needed to do it.

Like I said, no play in the driver side wheel, but the noise is pretty annoying.

1nuk14w,Story & Question,"Okay, bear with me.  I am a plumber, not a mechanic!

We have a 2017 Honda CR-V EX AWD (Engine: L15BE & CVT).  110k miles.  All maintenance done at official Honda dealer on schedule.

Few weeks back the county messed up and sent a bunch of people through chip seal that had either failed or was done wrong.  This was like liquid gravel soup that caused massive damage to a lot of cars.  It's been in a shop for 3 weeks for over 8k in repairs.  All lower plastic parts were replaced, along with struts/springs and rubber.  Finally picked up the car yesterday.

On our way home, about 15 minutes from the shop we heard a rhythmic click when braking about the last 10mph or so.  Could feel the click through the brake and floor of the car.  Seemed like debris as it was in tune with the wheel rotation but only did it sometimes.  We took it back and did a test drive with their mechanic who figured out it only happened when you braked in a way (downhill or hard brake) that the front end dipped forward.  They put it up on a lift and didn't find anything but once it was down, repeated tests showed the issue was gone.

Headed home testing it several times going down hill on the way just to make sure, seemed fine.  Couple miles farther than last time and we thought there was a slight whir noise, turned off the blower and listened and did not hear anything.  It was so short and mild we though it was just us being over sensitive after the first issue.  Couple minutes later, there was some sort of clunking noise and lost power to the wheels.  When attempting to accelerate, there was a whir noise followed by a CLICK.  We were able to go slower, but when she tried to accelerate with any torque, it would whir then click again.  Pulled over about 40 feet after the power loss at the first driveway.  The engine seemed to be running fine, inspected everything I could reach.  I did notice in the engine bay up on pretty much any ledge was gravel and tar that had not been cleaned up.  My wife had been driving, so I opted to drive it 20 feet to the next driveway after testing reverse and drive with no issue about 5 feet back and forward.  Driving up onto the road off the driveway seemed normal, but as soon as I went to start speeding up, the same whir then click happened.  Carefully pulled into the next driveway and started making calls.

Never had any issues with the car prior to all of this, as stated above all maintenance was done on schedule at the official Honda dealer.  The repair company had the vehicle towed to a mechanic and we are waiting for them to diagnose it today or tomorrow.  Insurance and the company both seem to be leaning toward it being unrelated to the tar incident, I was less concerned before thinking how could it possibly be unrelated.  But the repair company said my oil smelled burnt and was 6 months overdue when they checked it before sending it to the mechanic.  This does not line up as the stick on the windshield was 6 months old, but that's just because they forgot to change the sticker, it was actually done about 2 months ago and is done based on the vehicles reported % life (Honda dealer lifetime oil changes won't change them till 20%).

So now I'm trying not to freak out too much but would like some feedback to carry me over while waiting to find out if I'm going to coincidentally have thousands of dollars in repairs out of pocket or not.

Does anyone have any thoughts on the mechanical issues, what it sounds like, is it possible to have been caused by rocks and tar in the engine bay and across the bottom of the vehicle.  Most car issues I've run into in the past I've been able to find audio or video to compare noises to, but not much luck on this one.  I'm usually a let the experts in their field handle their side, I just research for fun or to dull the waiting.  Bit more concerned this time as it's not our mechanic, insurance said we could stop and have it towed to our mechanic but would likely be liable for the costs at this mechanic anyway so better to just wait till they finish.

Closest thing I could find was something about the cv axle not being reseated properly after the struts were replaced and slid out.  But low confidence in that being reliable (again, plumber not mechanic haha).

Recently, my Avenger has begun overheating while I'm driving, to the point that the gauge will be maxed out and the warning light comes on. 

Kicking on the heat and blowing it out will almost immediately return my gauge to normal. This works as long as I need to drive and keep the heater on.

My coolant fans are working. I have recently replaced the radiator cap, the serpentine belt, the water pump, and the belt tensioner. I have burped the radiator a few times.

When the overheating occurs, my coolant reservoir fills up nearly to overflowing, but has not dumped coolant on the ground. 

I see none of the usual signs of a blown head gasket, or a cracked block. 

I'm not actually losing coolant as time goes by; or at most a minimal amount 

A temporary solution I have stumbled upon, is to wait until the engine cools, remove the radiator cap, at which time all that excess coolant in the reservoir slowly trickles back into the radiator.

After doing this, my car will run at normal temps for several days, until the entire cycle begins again.

You might try running the car with the radiator cap off (take the cap off when its cold, then warm the car) to see if there's coolant flow.  There should be none until the thermostat opens, at or about normal operating temperature.

Since your heater core works, we know there's coolant circulating in the engine.  For some reason it isn't getting to the radiator and/or the radiator isn't cooling it."

Causes can be wiring issues, connector corrosion, ECU problem, or intermittent coil/igniter failure. 
You replaced the coil pack; misfire came back after a few days. That could indicate heat soak / intermittent electrical connection rather than a failed coil. The fact that the engine dies when coil 4 is unplugged is normal your car’s ECU needs all cylinders firing. Even new coils can fail intermittently (rare, but possible). Swap coil 4 with coil 3 and see if P1315 moves with the coil—this will confirm if coil/igniter is the culprit. Just be sure to swap them back after. 

Ensure ECU and engine grounds are clean and tight. Low voltage can cause igniter malfunction codes. If wiring and coils are good, the ECU’s ignition driver for cylinder 4 may be faulty. Could check compression on cylinder 4 if all else fails. 

I would at least start with all that."

I have a 2019 VW Passat 2.0T. A while ago, I started getting check engine codes for both oxygen sensors:

* **P2196** – Front (upstream) O2 sensor stuck rich (Bank 1 Sensor 1)
* **P0138** – Rear (downstream) O2 sensor signal too high (Bank 1 Sensor 2)
* **P0036** – Rear sensor heater circuit malfunction

In April, I brought the car to a local mechanic and paid **$350**.

They **only replaced the rear (downstream) O2 sensor** and noted on the invoice that they also “fixed the harness.”

The **front sensor was never touched.**

Right after the repair, the check engine light went off — but came **back the same day** with the **same exact codes**.

When I went back, they told me:

>“The front sensor was probably bad for a while and damaged the rear sensor over time. That’s why both were failing — you waited too long to fix it.”

But I’m confused because:

* They **only worked on the rear sensor**, which I paid for.
* I have a **warranty** from them.
* The rear sensor still shows codes (**P0138, P0036**) — even after they “fixed” it.

**My Questions:**

1. Is it even true that a bad upstream sensor can *damage* a downstream one?
2. Do these codes sound more like a **bad rear install or wiring** than just a “time delay” problem?
3. Should I go back and **demand they fix it under warranty**, or go to a **VW dealership for a real diagnostic** first? (I have \~$500 budget)
4. Has anyone had persistent O2 sensor issues like this with the 2019 Passat?

1nu5y1a,How often do you check your 12V battery health?,"Last week my 2016 Jeep Wrangler gave me a bit of a scare. After sitting for a couple of days, I noticed the headlights dipped on startup and the dash lights flickered. At first I thought it might be an alternator issue, but a friend reminded me the 12V battery could be the culprit.

Out of curiosity, I borrowed his bt100 to run a quick check. The results showed:

Voltage at rest: 12.43V

CCA measured: 610A vs 760A rated

State of health: about 61%

Internal resistance: 4.56mΩ

That lower cranking amps number probably explains the flickering and dim lights. What surprised me was how quickly the test finished and how clearly it displayed the results. It left no guessing about whether the battery was borderline.

It made me realize how much the small 12V battery can influence the overall reliability of a vehicle, even when everything else seems fine. Do you usually check your 12V battery with a tester, or just wait until it finally gives out?",32,1759214084.0,45,CarTalk,1759347267,2025-09-30 06:34:44,2025-10-01 19:34:27,"ThawtPolice (Score: 91): When it stops starting

Your symptoms sound like a battery that is tired but still has life in it. 

It is possible that the connections to your battery (or from the battery cable to ground) are corroded.  Measure the voltage on the posts while lights are on (or cranking) vs voltage from positive cable to the frame.  See if this voltage diminishes a lot in a few minutes.

At nine years, your battery really doesn't owe you anything.  That said, mine is at 9 1/2.

Especially with Kias I’ve heard others say similar stuff. If it’s subtle and only happens in that speed range, it might be normal. BUT trust your gut. If it feels off, don’t drop it. Keep recording it and push the dealer again later if it gets worse. Whistle sound from vent when accelerating in sport mode. That actually sounds normal. Sport mode opens up airflow, and you can sometimes hear the intake system more. Mine does a similar quiet whistle when I floor it. Unless it gets super loud or starts happening constantly, you’re probably good. Parking sensors going off randomly. Yup. Totally a thing. They’re super sensitive can trigger from curbs, bushes, metallic objects, or even other cars' sensor signals. Can also be weather-related. Annoying, but not usually a big issue unless it’s tripping constantly in totally open spaces.

Honestly, you’re doing the right thing by paying attention early. Dealers always say it’s normal until it’s not. So log everything. Save videos, dates, sounds. If it ever turns into a warranty claim, you’ll be glad you did. Also, if you’re keeping the car long-term, maybe look into something like CarShield or another extended warranty once the factory one runs out. Not saying it's magic, but it can help with these mystery electronics problems down the line. Sounds like normal stuff for the most part. Keep documenting in case it escalates. Sensors are drama queens. You’re not crazy trust your instincts. Drop that video if you haven’t already, people here love diagnosing ghost noises."

1nune55,Most people have no idea what actually happens during auto body repair,"I've noticed a lot of people are completely lost about what happens to their car when it goes in for body work. Thought I'd break down the actual process since it might help someone understand what they're paying for.

Auto body repair is basically anything that's not mechanical. Dents, scratches, crashed panels, paint damage, frame issues. If it's the outside structure or appearance of the car, that's body work. Most people don't realize how much actually goes into making a car look normal again after even a minor accident.

When a car first comes in, the shop isn't just looking at the obvious damage. They're checking underneath, inside wheel wells, looking for frame damage that's not visible from just standing there. They take tons of photos because insurance wants documentation of literally everything. Sometimes they write an estimate thinking they got everything, then start taking things apart and find more damage. That's not anyone trying to scam, it's just how it works. You can't see bent frame rails until the bumper's off.

The insurance part honestly sucks for everyone involved. The shop sends them the estimate, insurance sometimes comes back and says ""well we think this should cost less"" and then there's back and forth. The whole industry runs on insurance money so everyone has to play that game. Once that's approved though, actual work can start.

First thing that happens is basically disassembly of whatever's damaged. Bumpers come off, fenders come off, lights, trim, all of it. The car looks worse before it looks better. This is usually when hidden damage shows up, and if it does, another supplement goes to insurance and there's more waiting for approval before continuing.

If the frame is messed up, that's serious stuff. Shops have these laser measuring systems that tell them if the frame is bent. Then they use basically giant hydraulic pulling systems to straighten everything back to factory specs. If the frame isn't straight, the car will never drive right. Tires will wear weird, it'll pull to one side, the whole thing is just bad. This is one of those things that can't be cheaped out on.

After structural stuff is fixed, it moves to actual body work. That's grinding, hammering, using body filler, sanding, more sanding, even more sanding. The goal is making everything perfectly smooth. If there's even a tiny imperfection, it shows through the paint. People think painting is the hard part but really it's all the prep work. Masking off everything, priming, sanding again, making sure the surface is absolutely perfect.",32,1759262135.0,13,autorepair,1759347267,2025-09-30 19:55:35,2025-10-01 19:34:27,"Western-Bug-2873 (Score: 2): Most people don't even know that body work is a whole separate discipline from mechanical repair.

Most manufactures recommend replacing brake fluid every 10 years or less.   Coolant has a shelf life, too.  Over time, it pulls minerals from your engine's internals and becomes more basic or acidic (I don't remember which).  In any case, it will begin to eat away at your engine internals and cause issues.  Manufacturers have different recommendations for how long coolant lasts before it is replaced.  

It all comes down to how well you want to maintain your car and how long you intend to keep it.

I’ve always tried to use good stuff, but I haven’t owned it for very long and it was not in great shape when I got it to begin with. it had a little bit of an oil leak persisting for a while now and I’m starting to wonder where the actual leak might be coming from… could it be something relating to the oil pump or the gasket there or maybe the oil cooler? I’m not really sure … Anyhow, I know it needs an oil change real bad but I think I hear uncle rod knocking on the door… that being said, my girlfriend just got a new but used 2025 Forester …and it kind of sounds like a sewing machine to me.  It’s got only 7 1/2 thousand miles on it… ?!?

So!  the point of this is really to ask the community between these two cars do you think my old 2004 Forester x has developed rod knock? And, is my girlfriend‘s new 2025 Forester supposed to sound like that?

P.S. I know my remanufactured alternator sounds like shit. I think the belt was too tight at some point while trying to eliminate squeak and it just fucked the bearings up or some shit. I don’t know…. My timing belt and tensioner was done probably like seven years ago or less, but maybe it has something to do with that. I don’t really hear it as much when I rev it up and I don’t hear it as much when I’m in the cabin just really at idle and it still persists when it’s warmed up. Idk 🤷‍♂️

1nuaq0b,Need help with finding out Car Brand,"**Question Answered!**  
  
I am horrible with car names. I look at one and go, that's a car (and that's about it.)

Let's get to the point: I'm writing a book, and one of my characters goes up to an old car and needs to get the door open. (The window is open enough for his arm to get in) He hopes the car is older and can crank down the window manually (because the car is old and can't be turned on.) But it doesn't have a crank. So then he goes to unlock it, by pulling the lock pin up, and opens the door.

*I* don't care what the brand is, but I need to be accurate with the brand. So the car needs to be one that has a lock pin and no hand crank for the window. It's got to be a shorter car with four-five seats. (You know, one with the backseat where there's a seat in the center, but you'll be squished between two other people.) Anyway, if you know a car brand/name of a car that matches this description, throw it here and I'll use it for my book.

1nurwwc,Car problems progressively getting worse,"Could use some opinions on what may be happening to my car. It is a 2017 VW Tiguan S 2.0/4L AWD with 93k miles on it. Here's a ~~brief~~ long history of the last few weeks:

8/29: Replaced spark plugs. Previous spark plugs weren't the cleanest, but no excessive oil found in/around. One of the spark plugs had a small piece of the ceramic missing. Like 1/8""-1/4"". Not sure what to do about that specifically, so just monitoring. Car feels fine and normal after replacement though. Started normally, all gears felt normal. There may have been a few 'hiccup' feeling moments, but I attributed that to using new spark plugs/my car feeling like that in general (what I mean about a 'hiccup' is like maybe 0.1s of what feels like lost power. From what I can tell, this happens during gear shifting).

9/1: Drove back home after the weekend, about 3.5 hours and 180mi. Car felt normal the entire time.

9/2: Car started just fine, drove about 50ft, EPC light and check engine light started blinking intermittently. To be clear, not blinking quickly or at a specified rate. Blinking interval looked random to me. Car felt like it was losing mechanical power in spurts during this time. Kind of jerking/jolting with the change in power. Car idles perfectly fine. Reverse feels normal as far as I can tell. Have not tried getting the car past first/second gear. Parked car back in my spot and started to look for what was happening (I suspected something spark plug related because I had just replaced them). When I had parked my car back in my spot, no EPC light or check engine light were illuminated. Obviously, popped the hood and starting looking around for anything obvious. The only thing I found was this very odd hose between my center two coils. The item is 06H133583G, as listed on the side of it. It is a ""fresh air hose"". Literally no idea what it is or what it does, but the yellow-ish filter(?) looking substance on the inside was cracked and falling out. That was the only thing I found to be out of normal (have not ordered a replacement as of writing this).

9/6: Have not driven my car still. Decided to check the gap on the spark plugs. Cracked two of the coil connecter plastic pieces so ordered a few new ones. Noticed a decent bit of oil on the base of my far left spark plug. Did not seem too excessive, but questioned why there was any oil coating the threads of a newly installed spark plug. Anyway, checked the gap and they were all about 0.029"", VW specifies 0.032"" so widened the gap a hair. I doubt that small discrepancy would have created this issue.

9/12: Still have not driven car. Replaced coil connection plastic pieces and decided to test car again today. Car felt normal for the first 50ft. Same issue happened as on 9/2. This time, however, my car died. Battery light illuminated, no more driving power. Coasted in neutral back into my spot and it's been sitting there since. Car will not start. EPC fully illuminated and stayed on. Check engine light not on.

9/19: Checked the spark plugs again today. No excessive oil in the left one. Small carbon buildup on the bottom sides of the plugs but does not go further than like a thread or two. I think this is normal. Replaced the battery because it was about time anyway. Put some dielectric grease on the spark plug boots. Car still won't start. Does not click like the battery is fully dead, rather it sounds like it's trying to start. I've had this happen on a previous car and smacking the starter motor with the handle of something during ignition usually helps. This component is buried in my car, so that's unfortunately not a test I can perform.

I am not sure what the issue could be. I convinced myself it's a spark plug issue, but now it won't start. I thought maybe I had accidentally unplugged something while toying around in the engine bay, but inspecting with a mirror and flashlight yielded no results. The excessive (maybe) oil on one of the plugs was making me think it could have been a misfire issue created by oil leaking through the liquid valve cover gasket rtv seal. I have some things coming in the mail to be able to replace the rtv gasket myself, the PCV valve,  and some of the soft goods in that area, but now I am wondering if it seems I need to replace my starter as well? What other issues could this be? I should have turned to Reddit sooner, but here we are. Any advice?

**Engine:** 4L 6cyl Barra  
**Mileage:** 320k km (198k mi)

I think the headgasket in my car might be done for. There's white smoke coming out of the exhaust, not constantly it seems to come and go, at first I passed it off as just moisture in the morning but I think it might be more serious now. My coolant is also dropping over time, I'm also pretty sure the expansion tank is bubbling very slightly when it's running too. However it hasn't overheated at all, engine temp is perfectly fine even on 3hr highway trips.

Googling around tells me I can expect to pay $1500-3000 for a headgasket replacement, and that's pretty much what the car is worth.

Thing is though, I'm only in the country (Australia) for the next 8 months, and I only need the car to last me that long, although I do plan to use it for long trips (occasional 10+hr drives) during that time as well, and if I have to just scrap the car after I can deal with that.

I need about another 20k km max out of the old girl, I know I really should replace the headgasket, but if I don't replace it what am I looking at in the future? Will it gradually get worse or just suffer complete engine failure some random day?

My old vehicle got written off due to a stupid driver and due to being in a bad predicament I decided to jump and buy a new car the same day without vetting it properly. When I test drove the new car everything was fine and smooth. After purchasing it, on the way home the check engine light turned on after 20 minutes of driving and the low coolant light came on. Was worried about it already and 10 minutes onwards of driving and the engine temperature warning light came on. After driving for another 10 minutes it turned red and the car went into limp mode. We had to pull over on the hard shoulder of the motorway and gave it about 20/30minutes. We located a petrol  station about 7 minute drive from us and we went there after letting the engine cool down for 30 minutes ish. After topping up the coolant (which was extremely low when we topped up) the car then got us to our final destination but the engine temperature warning light turned on again during our last few minutes of driving. Yesterday I got the car diagnosed and apparently there’s an issue with the water pump and a couple other error codes. I will post these codes along side this. I was wondering what this might mean and what else I need to get fixed.

They should have given you an estimate to replace the part that wasn’t able to be adjusted, if they did this and you declined the work but told them to adjust what they could then yes you need pay for it. If they called you during the alignment and said XYZ can’t be adjusted and you told them to continue the alignment then yes you still need to pay.

If they did not make you aware of it until you picked the vehicle up then I would argue paying for it with them. In that scenario they didn’t complete the job and didn’t communicate there was a problem completing it.

1num8e7,Dragging disk brake. Tried everything. 2018 Forester.,"I just completed a full replacement of all pads, disks, cylinders and calipers.

After doing the suggested slow break in off the premium pads and disk, the front driver side was dragging. Measured 280F with my laser thermometer.

I let it cool overnight and drove around using only the parking brake. temperature was about 220F. All the other disks were at 98F.

I then replaced the pads, paying extra attention to the clips and the retraction spring attached with the wear indicator. The pads floated nicely in the caliper, not tight at all. The cylinder assembly floated nicely in the frame and double checked the 2 bolts to make sure nothing was skewed.

Then I re-bled the line a good deal.

There was no improvement.

Then I changed the flexible brake line as suggested by the State Inspection Mechanic. He did not fail me but told me I was going to burn up my new pads.

The only thing left is to replace the cylinder assembly or rebuild it if kits are available (no)\*. I understand that the seals are part of the retraction mechanism. Maybe take it apart and look for burrs?

What did I miss?

What else can I do?

Can I just drive it and hope it wears in? How hot is too hot?

I've been replacing parts since, but nothing is fixing this car. It's a 2002 Buick Lesabre with a 3.8 (vin K).
So far, I've replaced:
Spark plugs
Plug wires
Coil packs
MAF sensor
Fuel filter 
Fuel injectors. 
I've checked for vacuum leaks and can't find any. The injectors were put in last night (a friend of his insisted it was the injectors so I changed all 6 of them). Afterwards there was no change though..CEL still flashing & running like crap. I didn't smell gas anymore but performance wise it's still missing. I read the codes while my husband drove it and was clearing the codes as they popped up. Multiple times a lean condition code showed up with the 0300, which is pretty common with misfires iirc, but one time it read a P0466 code. I ordered a new purge valve, but I'm not convinced that's the issue. Said code has never came up before and I double checked all connections to it after doing the injectors. The fuel pressure regulator is not leaking, but I ordered a new one of those too just in case. I'm at a loss though! I know there are other things it could be, but I also might be overlooking something simple. I'm starting to wonder if his fuel pump is going bad bc his sending unit does not work and he's ran out of gas at least 6 times this year..which is not good for the pump, but I'm not sure.

Rotors weren’t resurfaced?

Rotors are probably glazed making it harder for the new pads to bed into them.

Polymathy1 (Score: 33): Couple things going on here.

Most shops don't break-in brakes even a little bit. You'll want to heat up the pads by doing some hard braking several times *without fully stopping* in a remote area. That helps the pads start depositing the glue onto the rotor. That glue does most of the stopping. Until it's evenly coated on the rotor your brakes will be less effective. Likewise, until the surfaces both smooth out from rubbing each other, the brakes will be less effective. If the break-in is done, they should start improving by about 100 miles. No break-in could be more like 200-500 miles. In either case, it will take some time for them to work better.


Second, the pads could be a lower friction rating and just not great as pads. You can ask the shop but they probably don't know. It's stamped on each pad as 2 letters in the US - EE is weak, GG is powerful. The letters should match. EF pads will only grab well when warm/hot and FE pads will lose grabbing power as they heat up.

Third, the shop may have done it wrong or just missed something. If you can press the pedal to the floor ever, or if the pedal is squishy with the car off, then there is air in the system or a failed part. Some people started thinking that removing the preservative oil from the rotors is not needed. That's false and will cause the brakes to work worse for their lifetime.

Last, the fluid should have been let out through the bleed screws, but it probably wasn't. Shops like to pretend that's unusual so they can charge for a fluid change, but it's the only right way to do it. It's also best practice to replace fluid every 2 to 3 years for the entire system, which is generally at every brake pad change."

You can back-probe the clutch connector to see if the system is disengaging the clutch, or if it's actually seizing up.


If it's disengaging, it could be momentarily tripping the high pressure switch due to moisture in the system or being slightly overfilled with refrigerant, but if it's actually seizing, then it's a much more severe case, and will destroy that new clutch pretty quickly.

I have a question about truck storage/maintenance. I just bought some property that is a state away from my current home with the intent to develop it into a homestead to retire to in 4 or 5 years.

Our plan is to purchase a pickup truck to keep at the property so we can haul items, develop the property, and ride on the dirt roads (my SUV is way too dainty for real off road use).

My question is: how do we park/store the truck. Our main house is 6 hours away, and we plan to be out at the property at least 1-2 weekends a month. Meaning the truck will be sitting for most of the month.

What would be the best way to make sure that the truck is taken care of? We want it to last at least until we move to the property fulltime. The vehicle we're looking at is at 74k miles and a 2018 Ram 1500 tradesman.

I know my dad used to store his vintage vehicles and motorcycles by taking the battery into the house and doing something to the fuel (I was quite young when he had them, so I don't really remember what all he did other than have a battery charger and batteries on the kitchen counter).

How long has it been since the last oil change? It could be burning some if the oil change intervals haven't been kept to and its been driven a lot. If its been less than 4-5000 miles since the last oil change, top it off incrementally until its full and see if the light goes off.

Anyway, 5 years later, I'm looking for something more reasonable and practical, a bigger car and I go to an AA approved Garage, and pick up a £5,000 Peugeot 3008 Semi-Auto.

18 months into owning that car, and my mechanical bills have been ridiculous, I was rinsed keeping that car moving, but I had no choice.

I've since had the car checked out by two mechanics, who said that injectors are failing and it's not worth repairing given the pain in the backside the engine is with this vehicle.

I also had a noise on the front left axle whenever I went over a bump developing and it needs 3 new tyres.

The cost to maintain this vehicle, with things just constantly going wrong got tiring, so I traded it in agreeing a terrible price, because it was basically scrap.

Anyway, fast forward a few weeks, and the car is sat on their forecourt, for £3495, with them stating a full service history (It doesn't, the previous owners never maintained it) it states it's a stunning drive, yet when you turned it on, the engine feels extremely rough on the cold idle and for about 30 seconds if you were to drive it, it feels like the engine is trying to jump out of the car at you.

On top of that, the gears can be a little unreliable sometimes jumping incorrectly, so I know the gearbox needs work soon.

But what makes me laugh about this garage is, they are AA approved, and they still left 3 tyres on the vehicle, that are at the edge of their lifespan, seriously close to limits and saying ""long MOT, June 2026"".

I'm highly concerned that some poor guy is going to rock up, and buy that car and have one hell of a mechanical nightmare with it.

I'm also now concerned that the car I've bought has been just as equally ""oversold"".

I'm just glad I've checked the history of this car fully, and it really does have a stunning MOT record and service record.

  
tl;dr 

I sold my second hand money pit, to a garge on the basis they were scrapping it, so didn't negotiate the trade in value, it has multiple problems that will cost a lot to fix, and they are trying to sell it as if it has a full service history and is ""immaculate"".

They changed the 80k miles/5 year limit a long time ago. Since they don't release any actual intervals it's been up to sleuths to figure it out. Last I heard it was 200k miles and unlimited time but someone will likely chime in and say it's 10 years/140k miles. They probably aren't wrong because it's been slowly extending over recent times so who knows for concrete what it is.

Doesn't help that people mix up KM and Miles. So a degree of accuracy is lost there.

And if anyone says 200k miles and unlimited time is too long, I don't disagree. Just repeating what I've read, absent of any official VAG statement. Personally I do mine still every 5 years or 80k miles.

I currently have a 2012 1.6T Ford Focus MK3 Titanium X, which for the most part I absolutely love. It drives so nicely and the engine is a great balance of performance and economy returning 180 odd bhp which is enough for me.

Sadly now the car is showing it's age, I've had to reseal the boot as it was leaking, some of the lights are flickering and the car really rattles which is driving me slightly insane. 

Unfortunately, it seems that the boot hasn't held up and will now need sealing again and I think it may be time to look for a new car.


For my next car I'd ideally like something that has similar power or more. I do a fair amount of motorway miles so it's nice to have that extra grunt for overtaking but also makes it more fun on the lanes where I live. It would also be good if it had a relatively comfortable ride and the suspension wasn't too stiff and there was a reasonable amount of space to take four passengers, I need to sometimes for work.

I'd also like an automatic as I can do a lot of stop start driving.

The other thing I would like from this car is for it to be well built and put together, particularly on the inside. I'm fed up of all the rattling and cabin noise on my focus and it would be great to have something more refined.

Lastly, and a bit of an unusual one... I really enjoy my music and would like the car to have a decent sound system. The Sony sound system on my focus is decent but it's let down by the fact it rattles the doors and the highs can be a little distorted. It's still one of the better systems I have heard in a car. 

I have also thought about buying a car and then upgrading the sound system but I don't know if this is a cost effective approach and would I get the same quality and lack of rattle as I would from the factory upgraded system? Also some will have separate amplifiers etc that you won't get if you do it yourself or pay someone to upgrade.

So far I have been looking at Golf GTIs specifically with the dynaudio system but there seems to be few of these around. I'm looking at the mk7 with the DSG gearbox.

I have also looked at Octavia VRSs but heard the Canton system is very underwhelming.

Taking my search in a completely different direction I have also looked at Mondeos 2017- . These appear quite well put together from what I've seen and do seem to represent very good value for money. The 2.0 diesel is very economical and returns over 200 hp. My worry with these are the handing could be poor and also I have heard stories about the powershit transmission being not so great.

I recently bought a used car from a dealer in England. I paid part in cash and did a part exchange with my old car. The car came with a 6-month warranty provided by the dealer.

Shortly after purchasing the car, I started experiencing issues like engine noise and also the car shaking when going over 60mph (happy to elaborate in comments if needed). I’ve been trying to contact the dealer to get it sorted under the warranty – I’ve called and sent multiple messages, but I’m now being completely ignored.

I’m not sure what my next steps should be. Can anyone advise what my rights are under UK law, and what I can do if the dealer continues to ignore me?

A few key points:
	•	The car was bought from a registered dealer, not a private seller.
	•	I have proof of purchase, the warranty terms, and messages I’ve sent.
	•	The issues started within a short time after the purchase (under 30 days).
	•	The dealer is local but won’t respond at all now.

What are my options to escalate this and get the car repaired, refunded, or replaced? Is it worth going through trading standards or small claims court if they keep ignoring me?

Thanks in advance for any help.

It goes into limp mode frequently and I fear the repair will cost more than what I paid for it (£3,250). I have done some research and identified several cars which are to my liking. I need a car primarily for commuting into work (15 mile round trip) five days a week and do the occasional 300 mile round trip to see family once every couple of months.

These are the cars on my shortlist:
VW Polo 1.0 TSI or EVO (£12-14K)
Ford Focus 1.0T (£12-14K)
Ford Fiesta 1.0T (£11-13K)
Škoda Fabia 1.0 TSI (£11-12K)

Ideally I want a car which has good reliability and decent MPG. I don’t really mind how much power it has as long as it can take from Point A to Point B.

My first choice would be the VW Polo but I don’t know whether it’s worth spending a bit more if I can save a bit of money and buy something equally as good.

1nudxmh,Third Party Warranty Dispute,"Alright, so the deal is my Astra 69 plate developed an issue twice, once with the vacuum pump for the turbo charger (it's a 1.2 turbo) and the second time with a similar issue except Vauxhall need to change the whole turbo system, due to low vacuum within said system.

Now, I have third party warranty that I purchased alongside the vehicle and the seller. I have the terms of said warranty. The warranty provider asked for the ""cause of failure"", which Vauxhall said would have been a set of faulty parts. Warranty ask ""but what caused those to fail"", to which ""low vacuum in the system"" was the answer. Warranty asks ""but what specifically caused the low vacuum"" - so you can imagine this going round and round.

Vauxhall receive the TSB (technical service bulletin) from head office that list a few things that can cause this, one of which yielded ""wear and tear of the wastegate system"" - instantly warranty say ""we don't cover wear and tear"". Instant dispute, because I go to the terms and appeal that decision based on a term that states only wear and tear parts as part of a normal service schedule are not covered.

Vauxhall email me stating that it's not a part subject to ""normal wear and tear as part of a service schedule"" so I could use it for my appeal. The Vauxhall email also stated that it would be just a faulty manufacturer part. Warranty come back and say ""we don't cover manufacturer defects"". Back to the terms; the words ""manufacturer"" and ""defect"" don't show up at all in them relating to excluded coverage. So I go back and ask them to state the specific term in my agreement this pertains to. I'm still waiting. They responded with ""if you don't agree with the garage diagnoses we can send out a third party engineer"" - this wasn't what I'd stated at all and so they clearly aren't reading my correspondance.

So, this has been dragging now for weeks. Is this something the Motoring Ombudsman can help with? According to my warranty provider's own terms, the repair should be covered with no issue, in fact they covered my repair of the vacuum pump the first time this issue occurred, so it's clear they just don't want to fund this repair.

Does anyone have any advice here?

2) It must be automatic. My wife has a wrist injury that I need to take into consideration. 

3) It must be reliable. I live in the middle of nowhere which was a motivating factor in buying new cars. They just seem to give you a sense of confidence in their reliability.

1nua5sd,Is this mobile mechanic ripping me off?,"So I’ve got a mobile mechanic who I’ve used a few times now and he’s been great. Always punctual, quick and good at his job. 

I’ve got him coming on Thursday to do the following work on my 2011 fiesta zetec s: 

Full service (oil, oil filter, spark plugs, air filter, pollen filter, top up fluids, give it a once over and stamp the service book)
Rear drum brakes (drums, shoes, cylinders, fixing kit) 
Replace expansion tank/new coolant 

He quoted £820+VAT, I’ve allowed £30 as I asked him to travel further afield to my place of work to do the job so let’s call it £790+VAT. 

Would you say this seems about right for the above works? I didn’t question it at the time but someone at work seems to think I’m getting slightly ripped off and I honestly don’t have enough motor knowledge to know how much the ballpark should be. 

Figured I’d ask here and see what people think!

They're the same car, A3 will have better finish and reliability will be the same. The 2015 is a nice car, I'd say inside it's even nicer than the most recent one. I've had a 2019 1.0 TFSI and can only say good things about it. I've traded it for a W177 and regretted it.

1nu5ms6,Best Car temporarily,"I’m thinking of getting a car with budget of about 5k as my first car after passing driving test and I intend to get a better car after about a year in range of 15-20k.

I want to spend as little as possible on the first car and associated expenses such as insurance,MOT checks. I’ve estimated will use said car for up to a year before switching but aware will likely need to spend a lot on insurance as my first car.

I aim to sell this car off afterwards and get some cash back from sale hopefully car value hasn’t depreciated too significantly by then.

I’ve been thinking recently if there are other deals that will give me a better deal and I won’t have to spend too much on first car + potential significant loss of funds from buying and selling.

Is PCP or hire purchase better if I’ll be using this first car for just a year in terms of return for money?, or buying and selling off after a year a better financial option?

Or something like a VW Polo. Insurance will probably be better and it should hold value slightly more

If you’re doing short journeys then buy petrol, long motorway journeys then diesel. If you can fit a charger at home, consider an EV.

Phoenix_Kerman (Score: 1): brands aren't consistent in reliability, even engine lineups aren't consistent. you just look at the ford ecoboost engines, the one litre ecoboost was terrible but the 1.6 and 2 litre excellent engines. it's all quite specific per model so do plenty of research

people say go japanese if you want reliability but they tend not to do diesel engines too well.  you'd do well to be a bit more specific though. reliable could be anything from an yaris up to a d5 xc90.

for a first car and something family based i'd be going ford era volvo or a ford estate. mk2 focus estate with a 2 litre mazda engine i find to be an excellent car. the v50's the same car underneath and great with that engine. can't beat a full volvo 5 cylinder and they're dead reliable.

1nu40au,Moved to Australia and didn’t SORN,"In January last year, the insurance on my car ran out. I received a redirected letter to say I needed to SORN my car, and I never did (dumb but completely forgot about it)

I had been paying to redirect my mail up until around December last year as the address on my driving license was wrong, and then I moved to Australia.

My dad has used the car every now and then since then and has insured it by the day.

I’ve not received any more post to say about SORNing the car, and as of yet have received no fine.

Should I be worried? I’m planning to live in Australia permanently and will be going through the process of permanent residence next year, but even almost 2 years later could I still receive a huge fine?

1nu3u3q,Is a BOV really that bad?,"I'm not sure if all BOV's are really that bad for your turbo. If it flutters off-throttle, isn't it just stalling the air over the blades when the turbo is unloaded? In most modern turbo's, it just stalls the air briefly in a momentarily oscillation rather then a violent surge of air back into the turbo. I understand that in a flutter noise occurring while your on throttle, it is a whole different story, but flutter off throttle? Can it really be that damaging? Aren't diverter valves the ones that recirculate air back into the turbo rather then into the atmosphere like a BOV? Quite unsure on this topic",1,1759206568.0,3,CartalkUK,1759347267,2025-09-30 04:29:28,2025-10-01 19:34:27,"CwrwCymru (Score: 2): The flutter noise is from turbo surge and is caused when you get backflow through the compressor. A BOV is used to avoid this surge by either venting the air to atmosphere (that psssh sound) or by recirculating the air.

Backflow through the compressor is damaging, it's putting additional stress through the components and they'll wear out faster as a result. It's ignored in motorsport as a turbo is (kind of) seen as a consumable part and often people run antilag systems. OEM's don't want this additional stress so they use a BOV (usually recirculating).

To add to the confusion, some BOV's are adjustable so you can get some surge (flutter) while also using a BOV. This still isn't great for your turbo compressor but prevents large pressure differential spikes.

scuderia91 (Score: 1): Not the biggest expert on turbos so someone can correct me if I’m wrong. I think you’re conflating the noise from a blow off valve and the noise you get from stalling the air in the turbo if you don’t have a BOV.

It’s still a BOV whether it’s venting to atmosphere or recirculating"
