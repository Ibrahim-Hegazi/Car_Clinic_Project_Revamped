1mpkyfm,Freon recharge leak??,"My AC has been blowing warm air- particularly in drivers seat for a while and finally took it in. 
They said there are no leaks found but it‚Äôs down to 7 oz and they recommend adding 30oz of Freon at 30$/oz. So the total that includes the $240 diagnostic is $1200!! 

We‚Äôll probably take the car elsewhere to get the work done bc we already found someone who said they can do it for $300. But I guess I have to pay for the diagnostic service still. I‚Äôm confused though bc in my limited understanding‚Äî it‚Äôs a closed system and a car doesn‚Äôt just ‚Äúuse up‚Äù Freon. So there would have to be a leak right? So wouldn‚Äôt they have found one in diagnostic service that I‚Äôm paying for?

1mpkavu,Chevy 5.7L 350 small block - Mystery with high oil pressure,"Hi folks, got an old 1988 (new to me) chevy g20 with the 5.7L v8 350 small block. American motors are new to me and I am trying to learn and understand how to diagnose and fix it. Perhaps someone with knowledge here can push me the right direction.

Issue is that during idle oil pressure settles to around 300kpa (43.5 PSI), this is with a warm engine. Would I put in drive the pressure will quite quickly go to 400kpa (58 PSI) which is the max on the gauge. 

If I accelerate or put any load on the engine pressure will drop to 43 PSI until I let to of the gas, for instance during engine braking, then it goes instantly back up to 58 PSI.

The pressure never seems to drop below 43 PSI and usually during cruise will settle at around the high 58 PSI. I have driven around 30-40 minutes cruise pace during testing

The engine to my knowledge sounds just fine, but I might not be correct.

Other facts and clues:

* I did an oil change, old oil looked black but nothing abnormal, still quite runny
   * New oil I put in is 10w40, slightly thicker then what I believe should be 10w30 however to my knowledge this should not be an issue for an motor from 88.
   * Before the oil change pressure was also equally high.
* There is a small, seeping oil leak somewhere higher up in the motor, it leaks down and is pooling on the starter, oil filter housing, bell housing.
   * Since the whole engine is covered in old thick oil and residue, hard to see but it potentially comes from the rear of the valve cover or intake manifold

I have two ideas what could be the issue but really curious to hear from people who have dealt with this engine before, super thankful for any help or tips!

MrDanksson (Score: 1): Forgot to add my own ideas:

One being that the sender unit which is faulty, I dont think it is necessary is as it seems to respond to differences in pressure. Worth checking thou if I get some tools for that.

Second being that inside the oil pump/sump there is a pressure relief valve or ""pressure regulator valve"" according to some drawings which could be sticking closed, however I find it a bit odd that it does not build more pressure then what it tops out at. Maybe the pump itself cant generate more then 400kpa or 58 PSI which is why the pressure sticks to that. Still does not explain to me why the pressure suddenly spikes as soon as I put it in drive.

Then of course the third, I could have some clogged oil paths down the rods, valves or cam building pressure, but then I figured I would have grenaded the engine quite quick into the drive if those did not get lubricated."

1mpjdw8,1984 GMC G3500 w/ 8-bolt Dana 44 front axle (Ford),"TLDR; **bold text**

Hello, I am in need of insight. Bear with me; I've never had one male figure in my life so I've been learning everything from forums, groups, YouTube, and helpful dudes like yourselves.

I have the van in the post title. When taking the differential cover off, a roll pin fell out and another one was left laying in the bottom of the case, as well as a small corner off one of the pinion teeth. After looking at a few diagrams I only saw one pin. So, I tapped in into place and put the cover back on with fresh oil.

Immediately, I was in a bad motorcycle accident where a lady took a left in front of me. I was in the hospital for a month and not able to walk for another few.

After finally driving the van I heard it clunking in the front. Took it to a 4x4 shop and they charged me $250 just to take to cover off, look at it, and then reseal it with RTV (although I had a new paper gasket on it). Dude said it was an easy job rebuilding these.

**So they were initially supposed to hook up my alternator (it needed the pigtail hooked up properly) throw a couple grounding straps on the van and quote me on a front axle rebuild. Pic 1 is the bill for that. The other is the quote on the axle rebuild (and that's just the ring and pinion).**

When I dropped the van off two weeks ago and asked to speak with the mechanic for five minutes, I was told, ""no, we are way to busy."" They started unhooking wires and couldn't get it started so they started messing with the distributor. After a couple days they asked me to come start it. I hooked up the wires that they unhooked and rotated the cap until it was starting and running properly. He said he would put it back in time because they threw it off.

Maybe I needed a rant after seeing the bill and I need to take my van somewhere else. Maybe I'm being dramatic. You tell me. Interwebs say a shop should charge between $600-$1200 for a **full** rebuild. This shop is quoting me over $2000 for ring and pinion and carrier and whatnot.

I just need to get this thing from Daytona back to New York. There I have family and places I can take anything apart and I have my two younger brothers and their friends to help me do all the things I want to do to it.

**Can I drive it with the front driveshaft removed all the way back to NY?

 the only pressure in the cooling system is created by the coolant getting warm and expanding. 15 seconds is not enough time to build any heat to expand the coolant to push the depression up..

 if the depression in the saran wrap did push up. then you have either a blown head gasket or a cracked combustion chamber. or both.. this is a crazy easy test.. 

 if you saran wrap did inflate.. the next step is to have your mechanic do a compression leak down test.. where they bring each piston one at a time to exact top dead center with just that spark plug out.. screw in an adapter and put compressed air into the cylinder.. hopefully having the saran wrap set up or a thin vinyl glove to see if the air leaks from the cylinder to the cooling system..

When i put the multimeter on the wire coming into the resistor I get 12.4 something volts. When I test the resistor output It bounces around  anywhere from the mid 100s to the 300 millivolts, not volts. 

We put a new resistor on and it does the exact same thing and the fan still does not work.

I have a 2008 Toyota Yaris with the 2NZ-FE engine and about 300,000 km on it. Occasionally, when I turn the key on (before cranking, with the engine not turning yet), I hear a small explosion coming from the intake manifold. It happens randomly (not every time ) and the car otherwise runs fine once started.

About a month ago, I replaced all four spark plugs and ignition coils. The plugs I installed are aftermarket, not OEM and the problem started roughly a week after that replacement.

The intake manifold has never been removed or cleaned.

If that is the case and it's not repaired and working properly yet. Let's not worry about speculating why the compressor failed just yet.

Catastrophic internal failure of the compressor would require replacement of the entire a/c system. Which it doesn't sound like they are doing. 

There are 4 possible failures that could be lumped into a bad compressor. 

Clutch doesn't engage when commanded on, now this can be with or without magnetism, there is an electromagnet that the vehicle powers to engage the compressor clutch and spin the compressor to generate pressure. So while it's running you carefully stick a pry bar into the engine bay to see if the magnetism pulls on it, its short range the magnetism only reaches about an inch. Normally this would be the clutch is worn out. 

Clutch doesn't engage when commanded on without magnetism, this would normally just be the electromagnet is bad and has an incomplete/broken circuit.

Clutch engages when commanded on, a/c system doesn't pressurize. This would normally be catastrophic internal failure of the compressor preventing it from compressing the refrigerant. You would then have to evacuate the system and check for what the industry calls ""black death"" in the system, essentially the compressor will create very fine metal powder from internal failure, the powder mixes with the a/c system lubricant and you get a black oily residue inside the system. Which can either act as an abrasive and damage a new compressor or can accumulate in certain locations resulting in a blockage/restriction. Which is why it basically needs the entire system replaced.

Now the last failure is a newer failure due to a change in compressor design, they use a variable capacity solenoid to adjust how hard the compressor has to work based on how cool the interior of the vehicle is to reduce load on the engine and increase fuel economy. These solenoids(electronically controlled valve) can get stuck in the fully open position and essentially bypass the part of the compressor that compresses. It's not sold as a separate serviceable part, but as part of the compressor so it would be considered compressor failure."

I've got a 25 year old SEAT 1.4 that makes about 60hp on a good day. It's very well maintained BUT it is, as you can imagine, slow as a sloth stuck in molasses.

Now I don't care much about speed, I cruise at a cool 80-110kmh but I would like the car to be able to make it up hills without ending up in first and revving its nuts off. 
Especially with 4 people on it, chances are we'll be better off getting off and pulling the car uphill ourselves like huskies with a sled.

Now I know the best course of action would be to sell and get a faster one, this is not feasible right now and it's an emotional choice as well so please let's stick to other available solutions.

Considering my options, swapping the engine is far too expensive for dubious results. And there's also a law over here that you can only get an engine that was used for this model from the manufacturer and only up to 25% more over its original cc's. 

So just throwing a 20vt in there would be at best problematic, not to mention overly expensive, having to change the gearbox, ECU, fuel pump and secondarily wheels, tyres and brakes along with the engine.

Now when it comes to mild tuning, I've never seen a car gain much by intake and exhaust mods, apart from extra noise. And considering the intake air filters are inside the engine cover that houses a gasses return hose as well, it'd also be a tad problematic in itself.

And so I ended up thinking about going for a forced induction solution, all without breaking the bank, if at all possible (that's where you guys come in).

Considering I don't want to add 200 horsepower to a weak engine, would it be possible to add a small turbo with a very slight boost (say 4 to 6psi max) without having to change the internals or even the fuel pump? 

And if possible, how would you go about it?

Again, I'm not trying to race here, even if I get 10 or 20 extra little horses I'll be happy.

Many thanks in advance!

They're really not the best engine at all for tuning. You can't just stick a turbo on an engine, especially not cheap. 
You'd need to sort out the mapping to increase fueling for the increased air, which the standard pump/injectors may not be able to handle. You'd also need to provide an oil feed to the turbo, intercooler, associated pipework, new manifold which would probably have to be custom made, doubt you'll get an off the shelf kit for it, new exhaust system, or downpipe at the very least. 
And that's all in the hope that the standard internals and gaskets can take the extra pressure of forced induction or if it'll just self destruct as soon as it hits full boost. 

You'd be spending thousands, as well as a huge amount of hours researching and customising everything to fit, just to make an unreliable small engine.

Pressures are controlled by solenoids, pistons, and valves in the valve body. If they are worn they are worn. Metal circulating will help speed up the wear. There are rubber seals inside that can benefit with some additives that help restore their elasticity (like ester solvents).


Service with the correct fluid and filter (if equipped) and consider adding a seal conditioner like Lubeguard as well.

In a normally operating system the compressor comes on and begins pumping. It builds pressure on the high side of the system and draws a suction on the low pressure side. If the system is close to fully charged a lot of times a static reading can be in the neighborhood of 80-120 psi. When the compressor is running the low side should have a normal range of 35-45 psi. 

The conditions you're describing seem to indicate a leaking compressor shaft seal that has deposited refrigerant oil on to the clutch and is mixed with dust and dirt being drawn in by the fan to form a crude grease.

A squeaking noise also doesn't necessarily mean that you need new brake pads - It could be noise originating from the pads themselves being cheap parts, and the actual compound makeup of them is leading to noise, or the metal hardware that they slide in could be completely dry of grease which could also cause noise.

As far your oil level and unless your owners manual specified a different process for checking your oil, here is the procedure for checking the oil level on most vehicles:

1.	‚Å†‚Å†Drive the car so the engine gets to operating temp.  This may take 5-15 mins. 
2.	‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†Park the car on level ground and shut the engine off. Wait 2-3 mins.
3.	‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†Remove dipstick, wipe clean with a clean cloth or paper towel. Pay no attention to the level at this point.
4.	‚Å†‚Å†Reinsert dipstick fully into the tube, ensuring it‚Äôs fully seated.
5.	‚Å†‚Å†Remove dipstick and hold level/horizontal/parallel to the ground. Observe reading.  The oil reading should be where the oil shows around the entire dipstick, not just a thin strip. The thin strip is not a valid reading and has no impact.

If reading is above the halfway point of the two dots, take no action. If reading approaches the lower dot, add approx 0.5 quart of oil. Distance between the two dots is approx 1.0 quarts. If reading is below the lower dot, add 1.0 quarts and recheck after 2-3 mins.

If the dipstick is particularly difficult to read, you can add a bit of texture to the reading area by scuffing it with sandpaper or other light abrasion. Ensure you wipe any abrasion clean before reinserting.

DeathAngel_97 (Score: 1): A bit of smoke means you have blow by, not necessarily the end of the world on an old car if its not too much.

I'm thinking in order of least to most likely;

Valve train maybe, stuck/loose lifter, loose timing gear, loose tensioner, loose spring. Its DOHC so I believe that means no pushrods. I muster unlikely cuz pretty much every valve/timing issue comes with rough running and intense engine codes that make the problem far more obvious and, that noise is heavier than what valve stuff would sound like.

crankshaft endplay and other clearances. I've seen excess endplay be that distinct before but you've already been under there and the bearings would have loudly declared themselves the culprit. I should ask, you removed the bearings from the endcaps to be sure they hadnt spun?(very unlikely, but worth an ask)

Piston cap play. At the top of the rod theres a bar that the piston cap rotates on, I don't recall if you pulled the pistons out yet and if not, that is what I would be looking forward to inspecting, I'd guess one of the caps or two that are firing at the same time (since the noise is singularly repetitive and consistent) can be moved quite a bit and it wouldn't spill flecks as much as other knock causes would too. 

If none of the above then I would indeed check crank pulley play and then pretty much rebuild and hope for the best, I would be stumped."

I‚Äôve been able to sniff the CAN bus and parse the data to detect certain states (by reading the service manual and reverse engineering messages). That part works fine. But making it behave like a physical control is proving to be tricky.

I‚Äôd like to at least be able to control HVAC via CAN. The problem is:  
The hypervisor sends the relevant CAN message every 100 ms. If I simply overwrite that message with my own (like ‚ÄúHeat3‚Äù), the car‚Äôs display just blinks the new state briefly, but the HVAC doesn‚Äôt actually change.

I‚Äôm wondering if there are any approaches worth trying, or if someone could look at my captured CAN messages and give advice.

The attached log is from manually cycling the driver seat heater like this: Off -> Heat3 -> Heat2 -> Heat1 -> Off -> Heat3 -> Heat2 -> Heat1 -> Off -> Heat3 -> Heat2 -> Heat1 -> Off -> Heat3 -> Heat2 -> Heat1 -> Off -> Heat3 -> Heat2 -> Heat1 -> Off

I found that Message ID 0x373 shows the state changes.

Has anyone dealt with similar ‚Äúhypervisor overwrite‚Äù issues? Any tips for sending valid control messages so the system actually accepts them would be appreciated.

Do you want me to also include a short excerpt of the CAN log (with timestamps, IDs, and payloads) so people on Reddit can analyze it more easily? That could increase the chances of getting useful feedback.

Fast forward to March 2025 and another one blew (cylinder 1), so I replaced it myself. Then in May and June another two blew (can‚Äôt remember what cylinders those were) which I replaced. 

Prior to November 2024, in November 2019 one ignition coil and all four spark plugs were replaced, and all in mid 2015 all four ignition coils and spark plugs were replaced by the previous owner just before he sold it to me when the car had about 75,000 on it. 

Wondering if this issue I have currently with the car is related to this, with the air conditioner on the car sounds like it‚Äôs misfiring when in drive or reverse, when I‚Äôm driving at low speeds (below 10 mph) it feels like the car is misfiring. 

When I‚Äôm idling at a light it also does this and will feel like it‚Äôs trying to buck forward, but it‚Äôs not as aggressive as when there is a cylinder misfire. I also find that since this problem has come up recently, when the air conditioning is on it accelerates exceptionally slow (on ramps to the highway), and when I have to stomp the gas a bit to change lanes the car very aggressively responds, and will do so as well when slowing down from around 40mph to 25mph (I‚Äôd say it physically feels like an issue with the transmission, but I have not experienced that personally so I can‚Äôt say).

Had a more mechanically inclined friend look at the car this week and he said the hoses appear to be fine, filter is clean and engine looks fine. 

The car is old and was pretty aggressively driven the first few years of me owning it (dumb kid with their first car lol) but I just take it to work on the highway at around 70-80mph 50 miles a day 5 times a week.

1mpj985,1984 GMC G3500 w/ Dana 44 front axle (Ford),"TLDR; **bold text**

Hello, I am in need of insight. Bear with me; I've never had one male figure in my life so I've been learning everything from forums, groups, YouTube, and helpful dudes like yourselves.

I have the van in the post title. When taking the differential cover off, a roll pin fell out and another one was left laying in the bottom of the case, as well as a small corner off one of the pinion teeth. After looking at a few diagrams I only saw one pin. So, I tapped in into place and put the cover back on with fresh oil.

Immediately, I was in a bad motorcycle accident where a lady took a left in front of me. I was in the hospital for a month and not able to walk for another few.

After finally driving the van I heard it clunking in the front. Took it to a 4x4 shop and they charged me $250 just to take to cover off, look at it, and then reseal it with RTV (although I had a new paper gasket on it). Dude said it was an easy job rebuilding these.

**So they were initially supposed to hook up my alternator (it needed the pigtail hooked up properly) throw a couple grounding straps on the van and quote me on a front axle rebuild. Pic 1 is the bill for that. The other is the quote on the axle rebuild (and that's just the ring and pinion).**

When I dropped the van off two weeks ago and asked to speak with the mechanic for five minutes, I was told, ""no, we are way to busy."" They started unhooking wires and couldn't get it started so they started messing with the distributor. After a couple days they asked me to come start it. I hooked up the wires that they unhooked and rotated the cap until it was starting and running properly. He said he would put it back in time because they threw it off.

Maybe I needed a rant after seeing the bill and I need to take my van somewhere else. Maybe I'm being dramatic. You tell me. Interwebs say a shop should charge between $600-$1200 for a **full** rebuild. This shop is quoting me over $2000 for ring and pinion and carrier and whatnot.

I just need to get this thing from Daytona back to New York. There I have family and places I can take anything apart and I have my two younger brothers and their friends to help me do all the things I want to do to it.

**Can I drive it with the front driveshaft removed all the way back to NY? I can do a full axle rebuild once I get there.**",1,1755125282.0,2,AskMechanics,1755200072,2025-08-13 22:48:02,2025-08-14 19:34:32,"Moo-Dog420 (Score: 1): https://preview.redd.it/i97w7rufgvif1.png?width=883&format=png&auto=webp&s=824cb8360b7cc81074348fd05e4e9de12e9db5fe

1mpg7u5,Does adjusting brake shoe adjuster adjust both handbrake and foot brake?,"Does adjusting the brake shoe adjuster for the rear brake drums adjust both the handbrake and foot brake efficiency? I know that the cable is attached onto a lever which pulls when the handbrake is lifted up and this engages the shoes to make contact with the brake drums. And when the foot brake is applied, the pistons push out the brake shoes at the top to make contact with the drums.

My questions are:

1) Does the wheel adjuster adjust both the handbrake and foot brake in the same way? So if tightening it, does it really tighten both? Or more for the foot brake primarily, and handbrake is secondary and doesn‚Äôt get tightened as much?

2) Does only the top side of the brake shoes make contact with the drums when applied as the adjuster/spring is at the top where the piston is, I can‚Äôt imagine the bottom side of the brake shoes being pushed out too?",1,1755118154.0,10,AskMechanics,1755200072,2025-08-13 20:49:14,2025-08-14 19:34:32,"CaptnSave-A-Ho (Score: 2): Adjusting the adjuster moves the shoes closer or further away from the drum. Tightening the adjuster actually moves the shoes away front he drum which makes the brakes feel looser. Loosening the adjuster moves the shoes closer to the drum, making the brakes feel tighter. This translates into less pedal travel and less parking brake handle travel to set the brakes. 

The shoes work by getting wedged between the drum and the pin for the front shoe and electing between the drum and the wheel cylinder on the rear shoe. It doesn't matter if it's the parking brake applying the pressure or your foot, it all works the same. This wedging action is also why you might see slightly more wear at the top of the rear shoe, and at the bottom of the front shoe. The wedging is reversed when you apply the brakes in reverse as well.

1mp1v4e,Vauxhall Zafira 2015 1.4T oil question,"Another engine oil question - 2015 Zafira 1.4T
I know this has basically been asked in various ways already, but managing to get confused by oil specs...

I have a 2015 Zafira 1.4T. I will be replacing the turbo, so what I'm planning to do is to stick some engine flush through it first, then remove turbo and drop the oil pan to inspect/clean, then re-install the pan and install new turbo, then change oil again after 500-1000 miles or so. Will then continue with a normal(ish) schedule of probably 5K mile oil changes (I tend to do a lot of shorter trips) as well as general good care like letting it cool off idling for a bit before engine switch off etc.

So obviously I'll be needing a couple of jugs of oil - once to initially refill after assembling, and another for the subsequent oil change.

The official spec for this as I understand it is Dexos 1 Gen 2, 5w30.

I have some fully synthetic oil from ASDA of all places which states 5w30, ACEA C2/C3, API SP, MB229.51. At only ¬£22 for 5 litres it's far cheaper than most.

Is this equivalent to the Dexos 1 Gen 2 spec? Would it be a terrible idea to use this if even for the initial fill after re-assembly for 500-1000 miles? If I have to get something more expensive then so be it, but don't want to waste cash unnecessarily.

I've seen some stuff online saying that C3 should be equivalent to the dexos spec, but wanted to check.

1moui0n,P0455 error code - Is this why?,"I recently got error code P0455 on my 2002 BMW 325i (E46) wagon with 107,000 miles - the check engine light is on and that's the code O'Reilly found. It's an evap emissions thing - My dad thinks it because he put the fuel cap on incorrectly. (He also ""tops off"" the car, which I'm wondering if that could cause it.) O'Reilly said the light will go off on its own after a couple of fill ups where it doesn't sense anything.

I was getting my old SubZero refrigerator fixed, and the SubZero repair man suggested using Top Tier fuel and putting in some fuel injector cleaner...

So I bought a bottle of Lucas fuel injector cleaner at a Mobil and put it in the car. The gas station attendant gave me a paper funnel. And I started to notice it leaking out from the bottom of the car! (See photo.) Now I'm wondering if it's because I didn't push in the bottle enough (in retrospect it might have been easier without the paper funnel), and maybe I didn't get the little door thingy open enough (I didn't even realize there was a door there), and it was coming out of some overfill valve or something, or if this is a real leak that's causing P0455 (?)

There is minimal to no leaking when actually filling the car with gas, or after filling. (I say ""minimal to no"" because.I still noticed an occasional dribble when filling the car afterwards, but I don't know if that was residual fuel injector cleaner still making its way out or gas.)

So did I just make a mess of putting in the injector cleaner, or is this an actual leak that's causing the P0455 light?

If he was suggesting the fuel additive just because that‚Äôs fine, but if he was suggesting it as a resolution to the engine light know that cleaning the injectors will have zero impact on your evaporative emissions system.

1mosnyk,[2021 BMW 330xi] Is there still the chance my car can be a total loss after insurance estimate?,"I got into an accident last week and I received a first original estimate from insurance based only on one picture I was able to share.
The estimate was ~$6700, considering only cosmetic damages: rear door(repair and paint), front door (buy and replace), quarter(buy and replace), bumper(repair and paint), wheel (buy reconditioned). The estimate does not consider any potential structural/mechanical damages to the parts close to where I was hit (visible in the picture). However, the wheel was little bent inward and I could sense something wrong when steering (might be simply the tire obstructed). 
Today I went to the body shop where the car was towed. The staff told me that the car was still being checked but at first glance, any mechanical damage won‚Äôt be severe.

A lot of the time there will be extensive corrosion in the wiring harnesses, connectors, PCBs on computers and so on that don't show up for years after the initial damage.  Much of that damage is nearly impossible to find without gutting the interior and pulling out the harnesses to look them over which takes way too much labor to be part of a regular inspection.  It is a total gamble and usually involves years of troubleshooting electrical gremlins.  

Personally I'd buy a flood car and take the risk if it is super cheap, like 25% or so of its usual value.  Or maybe if I was going to strip it down to a bare frame and do entirely new wiring as a project, but that would need to be even cheaper.  In this case, 2/3 of usual value for a car that is already notoriously unreliable... I'd steer clear and keep looking."

Fans kick in as normal, so it's nothing to do with that or the thermostat. Radiator cap was changed too.

1mpjtsd,Advice on buying a Toyota approved used car.,"I‚Äôm looking at buying an Approved Used Toyota Corolla GR Sport (2022) from a dealer for around ¬£20k. It‚Äôs got super low mileage ‚Äî only 7,200 miles in 3 years ‚Äî and it looks in great condition.

The service history from the dealership shows:

1st service at ~1,200 miles

2nd at ~4,000 miles

Last at ~6,900 miles


A couple of things caught my attention though:

The car had a plate change at the end of March this year (now on a 22 plate) around the same time it had its first MOT and the tax expired.



Tax hasn‚Äôt been renewed since, which makes me think it‚Äôs been sitting with the dealer since then (around 5 months).

As I mentioned above, I suspect the car was with the dealer after the tax expired, and the MOT was done at the same time, showing 6,900 miles. It‚Äôs now at 7,200 miles ‚Äî so it‚Äôs somehow racked up about 300 miles at dealership since then, which looks like quite high even after considering all the test drives at the dealership.


The previous plate (also a 22 plate) now belongs to a Suzuki Swift, but this Swift was apparently first registered in 2023 (so a 22 plate on a 2023 car).

The plate isn‚Äôt anything special, so not sure why anyone would swap.

That Swift had 2 keepers, and the latest keeper (likely the previous owner of this Corolla) acquired it in July 2024‚Ä¶ yet the plate change is recorded in April 2025.
Original plate of the Suzuki Swift when searched the history, is invalid now now and not matching with any vehicle currently

Exhaust will want replacing once it corrodes through and starts blowing, but no point doing it before. Front shocks and springs are not essential but probably on their way out, keep an eye out for the springs snapping, I would change them at that point if it happens.

If the oil leak is something easy like a valve cover gasket might be worth doing before it gets any worse, if it's only a slight leak though just keep an eye on the oil level.

Rear axle can be sorted with a wire brush and some sort of coating to protect it afterwards, assuming it's not already too far gone. If it is, then it might be uneconomical to repair if it gets any worse by the next MOT, really depends what car it is and how much it's worth.

1mp736v,Purchased a car on Saturday that has a fault today,"Hi all

I purchased a 21 Tiguan from a reputable high street dealership on Saturday. Full service history, low mileage, passed its last few MOTs, etc. all seemed great. 

Today however, it has developed the SOS: Emergency Fault Visit Dealership issue. This is apparently a known fault with Volkswagen vehicles (this is my first Volkswagen). 

This has basically bricked the info system so that it's unusable and there's a warning triangle on the dash at all time. The info system is also in French.

We cannot use the microphone or speaker in the car either. I've called the dealership and they've booked it in to take a look and I am hopeful they can rectify. 

I have a couple of queries: 

The vehicle has 3 months warranty from the dealership. Will this issue typically be covered? I have seen people get quoted upwards of ¬£1,000 to fix the issue so I'm hoping | don't have to pay that. I've literally had the car 4 days and haven't even covered 100 miles in it.

Unfortunately less than a week after the purchase the car it would go into limp mode and throw the check engine light on the dash. 
I took the car back to the dealer so they can see what the issue is, and I stressed that I need the car so I can get to work. 
For the first couple of weeks I chased them every day so they could give me an update, but they would always come back with some sort of excuse of not being able to check it. 
I asked if they could provide a courtesy car, and they would always say that they do not have any at the moment (spoiler alert, they still don't have one), and that's when I verbally requested to reject the car as it has been less than 30 days since its purchase. They refused my rejection saying that I need to give them a chance to finish with the inspection of the car. 
That's when I immediately sent a complaint email to the finance company explaining the situation.
The finance company told me they would get in contact with the dealer to see what they can do.
6 weeks after the car was dropped at the dealer they finally mentioned that the DPF needed to be changed. It took them 3 more weeks to actually change it. Thoughout this whole time I mentioned multiple times that the whole situation has caused me financial and mental stress, as I had to keep paying for the finance, warranty, insurance etc. as well as rentals and ubers to get to my work.
After changing the dpf I took the car back (it's now been 2 months from the purchase of the car) and drove it back home. Within 2 days of getting the car back I got an engine light and the car would refuse to even start, after a second try I managed to start the car and drove it straight back to the dealer and I left it there. Coincidentally the next day I received the 8 week final decision letter from the finance company regarding the complaint, saying that they have not been able to resolve the problem and they will keep chasing the dealer for a resolution (They also offered  ¬£150 for the troubles I have gone through).
Since no real solution had been provided so far I requested once again to reject the car and I escalated the matter to the Financial Ombudsman.
The finance company quickly responded saying they will again chase the dealer and try to come into a solution. 
The dealer is saying that in order to go through with the rejection they need to inspect the car once more and find what the issue is (This was in end of May). 
We are now mid August, they can still not find what the issue with the car is, I am chasing the finance company for an update but they are not responding, my case with the Financial Ombudsman has still not been assigned to any caseworker yet, and I am still paying for a car which I have had in my possession for less than two weeks in total.

We are amenable to having one car seat in the front and two on the second row. However, I have found that on a lot of cars, this makes the middle seat very narrow for an adult sitting there.

1mozhdq,Buying an electric car - advice,"Morning all, my fianc√©es car is on the way out, and she has seen a VW e-Up! that she would quite like to buy. She only drives up to 10 miles a day, we have a drive where we could install a home charger, and I have a big diesel estate for if we need to go further afield, so it seems perfect as a second car. 

I have read about electric cars costing a fortune if anything happens to the battery, has anyone bought something similar and took out a warranty to cover any potential issues? Is it worth doing this?

I have not had an electric car before so any advice would be appreciated, thanks!

1moz6o0,Conundrum - Lease or Used Car,"End of the year my 408GT is going back to Leasys (wish me luck). 

I‚Äôm in a conundrum as to whether to go lease again or go used. I‚Äôve leased/PCP‚Äôd my last 5 cars (Madza2 x 2, Mazda3, Kadjar and the current Pug). 

Appreciate that a 3 year lease costs (for my budget) between ¬£10-12k, whereas I could buy a second hand car for ¬£5-6k, and then run the risk of what a second hand car could cost in maintenance etc - but have some equity at the end of year and l/or years of hassle free driving.

1moxr06,EV range dishonesty in media reporting,"So one news service this morning is covering a record breaking drive by a Polestar model 3 which did just over 580 miles on a charge

Commentary in the report included highlighting how the vehicle had travelled further than the distance from London to Edinburgh, which is a good proxy for being the longest distance most UK drivers would ever do.  

what it ought to have made more of is that the journey took over 22 hours, and was in fact done at between 25mph and 30mph, which are well known to be the most efficient speeds for an EV - with negligible energy requirement, negligible wind resistance and full ability for regenerative charging when going downhill or slowing for a junction

Oh,its an achievement of sorts, but its being framed as the proof of the suitability of EV for more use cases, which it most certainly is not. 

they really should have worked the return journey on a motorway and documented how many times it had to stop to charge.",203,1755069522.0,160,CartalkUK,1755200072,2025-08-13 07:18:42,2025-08-14 19:34:32,"kemb0 (Score: 40): Just want to clarify as some people don‚Äôt seem to be able to understand: this is not the official range stated on the Polestar website.

Some journalists tried to push it to its limits and they achieved some impressive results. But no one expects you to drive like a granny in an EV. Yes you can get pretty close to the stated range driving normally and also yes, just like an ICE car, different driving conditions and driving styles will alter your maximum range. This isn‚Äôt some leftist/green cover up. If I also drive at around 30 mph in my ICE car I too can get a lot more range than driving at 70.
