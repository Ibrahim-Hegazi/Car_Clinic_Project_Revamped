1obx5c8,Am I being ripped off?,"I was recommended this shop by the tow driver and also a friend of mine. When I spoke to them on the phone after the job was done I was quoted $2,128.42 after asking for more information about the part they dropped it to the price to $1,582.71, stating they were now only charging me what they paid for the pump. I just think adding $500 for a markup is insanely high and then still charging $500 for labor seems a bit much.

If they were willing to immediately drop the price after simply asking for the part number and cost was it out of guilt of charging me so high or did I just score really well with what are legitimately nice people and I got dealt a huge deal that I should be grateful for.

1997 wrangler 4.0, manual transmission, cranks all day but wont fire up. This car sat for probably a year and they're trying to get it back on the road. Scanner will not communicate with PCM, I have no power to the fuel pump, the gauge lights all work but the gauges themselves seem to not function (there is gas in the tank but the gauge reads dead empty, the voltage gauge doesn't move). I checked power on the 5V reference circuit at the PCM connector, and had about 0.36 volts, so I started unplugging everything on the 5V circuit one at a time thinking I had a decent starting point. I got a max reading of 0.75V after unplugging everything 5V related. No components seems shorted.

I briefly looked over the harness for anything obvious at first, but now I'm thinking it could be wiring so I started checking continuity on individual wires from multiple areas on the 5V circuit, and pulled some conduit off to really look close in several areas....haven't found anything so far. I've swapped relays a couple times with no changes including the ASD relay. I've also cleaned all the grounds I could find....one looked iffy but cleaning didnt help, the rest looked OK but I cleaned them up anyway, still no change.

If anyone could tell me where else i can look, that would be amazing.

TLDR: crank no start, no power to fuel pump, cluster has lights but no gauge activity, no comm with a scanner so I cant pull codes, almost no power on 5V reference. Unplugging 5V components doesn't help. Cleaned all grounds I could find, no change. Swapping relays doesn't help.

1obv8b8,Starting issues/Jerking during acceleration - '95 Pathfinder V6 3.0L,"1995 Nissan Pathfinder SE V6 3.0L VG30E Manual 4x4, \~278k miles

This issue was a bit of a slow burn. Couple weeks ago, I notice that it took longer to crank than usual. Still cranked reliably, just took longer. 

Went to an off-road park a week or so ago (RAM offroad park in the springs for a couple hours) and noticed that I had hesitation/jerkiness under heavier load/acceleration when I left and got back onto the street

This weekend I pushed it harder. I drove from the springs to montrose, CO (almost 5 hours), then tackled portions of the alpine loop (engineer/cinnamon pass) as well as Ophir pass. Did a decent amount of driving and off-roading to say the least. 

No issues the entire drive there and during all the driving. Issues only arose once I started to head home. Noticed the stuttering came back under harder acceleration (light acceleration and idle are completely fine.) I also stopped at a gas station and took like 10 minutes of attempting to start it to get it going. 

Managed to get it home but the start/stutter issue remain. Tach seems to be working like normal, jittering along with the jerking and when I attempt to start. 

I replaced all these parts recently for maintenance: 

* Fuel Pump 
* Fuel Filter 
* Spark Plugs + Wires
* Starter 
* Battery isn't super old, but I can get it tested (has a sticker from January of this year) 
* Air filter

‚Ä¢coolant temp sensor

Replaced these parts this morning to throw parts at the problem: 

* Ignition Coil
* Ignition control module

Gonna pick up a junkyard distributor and MAF sensor on my way home today just incase. I'm going to clean my original MAF sensor before I attempt replacement though. Who knows the last time it was cleaned/replaced. Car is 30 years old and I suspect theres a chance it hasn't been touched since the car first hit the road. Also I've been off-roading it a decent amount so I cant imagine all the dust and dirt is helping

1obv17d,Poor Workmanship Causing Problems,"Hello, I‚Äôm hoping to get some advice as I navigate this process. 

Last year I took my car to a local mechanic after a significant amount of rodent damage occurred. I had a generally awful experience with getting this mechanic to start work on my vehicle. Three months later I finally got the vehicle back in a seemingly normal state. All 4 wheel speed sensors were chewed, engine harness wiring was chewed, T-case wiring was chewed & module shorted. All of this is through a comprehensive insurance claim.

I almost immediately started seeing a P0455 code and shortly after began having intermittent ABS/SLIP lights. They would not stay on long enough to warrant a return. 

Fast forward to a month ago and the lights returned and I lost 4WD. I noticed the connector on my front left wheel speed sensor was loose from the zip tie degrading that was used to reinstall the obviously chewed connector. While manipulating the plug the truck side wires fell out of the connector. 

I had a friend remove the plug and reconnect the wires but that did not solve the issue. Took it to a dealership and the wheel speed sensor is not OEM and has failed as well as needing to install a new connector. The previous shop had to remove the fuel tank to repair a wiring harness. The dealership noted multiple areas that were glued together and some spots that had rodent damage, leading to the P0455.

So based on this history is there any chance I am responsible for any of this? Should I contact the previous shop? ",1,1760997197.0,8,MechanicAdvice,1761075307,2025-10-20 21:53:17,2025-10-21 19:35:07,Due_Distance_5841 (Score: 1): Your question ended at ‚Äúlast year‚Äù

Something to note, though, Jeeps are allergic to electricity, so bizarre electrical issues are quite common and something you‚Äôll just have to deal with in order to drive a Duckmobile. A huge contributing factor to their reputation as being unreliable.   

Now, starting with the *BRAKES*‚Ä¶ What happened? The brake pedal was harder or softer than normal?   Does your jeep have Auto Start/Stop on it? The engine turns off when stopped to save fuel and automatically starts immediately when you try to drive again. The lack of engine vacuum could explain a stiffer brake pedal‚Ä¶ essentially your power brake booster was turned off as well. The hydraulic brakes still work, but they require a lot more force on the pedal.   

As for the transmission, that‚Äôs a lot less clear. If major work was done ( ‚Äúnew v6‚Äù) then the shifter linkage could be out of alignment causing confusing issues. 

But, drive is drive and can‚Äôt really be confused with anything else unless 1) your engine was shut off at the time, or 2) the transmission is dying. 

The fact that you resolved everything by turning the key makes me think this was pretty much operator error, and you need to spend more time learning and understanding this vehicle without a bunch of spectators offering their two cents. 

You‚Äôre a kid, so I dare say that having a bunch of people in the car with their own opinions is similar to distracted driving, which you need to get a grip on as early as possible. Learn to focus or else that jeep is going to be in a junkyard very soon."

1obmzcs,Looking into taking legal action against warranty company?,"Hello, I will try to make this short but I do need the help on what should be my next move for this situation. Please check my post as I've already made long posts of this little issue stating all of the issues that l've had with this warranty and my truck being out for a month and haven't gotten to any agreements.

I want so see if I can take legal actions cause this is all bull crap at this time. So my car broke down 3 months ago, had to get a new track from a used car dealership. Truck came out at $36,000 financed with the warranty. Now the truck was fine for the 2 months but then after that it stopped working and I couldn't drive it or turn it on. Sounded like an engine problem.
So took it in to a really good Chevy dealership, which they have been really helpful with everything, and since then it's been a month because the warranty has not been helpful at all. To put the name out there, the warranty is called ""Veritas Global Protection"". (Never go for this warranty!)

So it's been a month already and this warranty keeps canceling the claim. I've already went through two leakdown tests and diagnostics and I have not gotten to a conclusion about this issue. It was stated from the beginning that this was an engine issue and that it had to be taken apart but this warranty seems to be dragging everything. I called them today because they keep canceling my claim and they have treated me very bad, calling me stupid and everything, and this time im not going to let them treat me that way.
So from what they said, they basically said that they wanted to do everything form the beginning again. S do tests and diagnostics all over again because I don't know why.

I'm not going to pay for all of that again and the tests that they made me do 2 twice showed no issue from what they originally wanted to see. I have a video where it shows how bad the engine is moving and the sound that can be heard coming from the engine.
They also wanted a test done with a glove put on the exhaust and I will show the video here, but since l don't know why they even wanted that test to be done can someone explain it. There seemed to be no issues with those tests but they want everything to be done again which I'm not doing.

They sent an inspector the first time I had put out the claim, which was a month ago, but they then later lied on all of the information and today I told them that if they didn't like the tests that were done by this mechanic, that I wanted them to send out a mechanic and do everything themselves because I'm already annoyed by all of this. And they said that they wouldn't sent out one as they had already sent out an inspector which I replied saying that yes, they did sent out one, but they then later lied with the information. They sent out the inspector and the inspector told the Chevy mechanic that a noise was present and that it might need to get a new engine and the warranty later lied that they didn't receive this information.

Warranty company cannot pay out a claim if THE issue hasnt been identified, and they certainly wont want to pay for a replacement engine on partial information.

also all this talk of ""why is a leak down test necessary, its the engine thats an issue""....a leak down test is done ON THE ENGINE. like i get it, a leak down test checks for leaks in the top end and the noise being heard is likely from the bottom end of the motor, but these arguments of ""its an engine issue i dont need a leak down test"" are not doing you any favors when it comes to coming across like you know what you are talking about (in reference to them calling you stupid)

and here is where i get a little confused. why are you asking the warranty company to pay for diagnostic tests ? in all my experience dealing with repair shops, diagnostic charges are ALWAYS conditional on finding an issue and paying for the repair....as in....you are on the hook for all diagnostics unless a problem is found and you pay for the repair, in which case they will usually waive the diagnostics and roll it into the repair cost....THIS is when the warranty company would step in to pay.

mechanics need to drop the oil pan and inspect for metal shavings. its probably just as easy as doing a leak down test on every cylinder. if the mechanics find metal shavings in the oil then you have a much better diagnosis to give to the warranty company AND a much better case legally if it comes to that.

also, find the terms of your warranty and read it carefully to make sure everyone is following it to the letter.

Be sure the middle piece (usually spring-loaded) is indeed stuck in the charging port and not pushed inside the charger. Make sure to locate the correct fuse for this charging port before attempting to remove anything from the port, especially if it's made of metal like a pair of needle-nose pliers. The minute you stick something metal in there and contact the sides while touching the center, the fuse will blow and the outlet will shut off until a new fuse is installed in the fuse box.

1obmq45,Looking into taking legal action against warranty company?,"Hello, I will try to make this short but I do need the help on what should be my next move for this situation. Please check my post as I've already made long posts of this little issue stating all of the issues that l've had with this warranty and my truck being out for a month and haven't gotten to any agreements.

I want so see if I can take legal actions cause this is all bull crap at this time. So my car broke down 3 months ago, had to get a new track from a used car dealership. Truck came out at $36,000 financed with the warranty. Now the truck was fine for the 2 months but then after that it stopped working and I couldn't drive it or turn it on. Sounded like an engine problem.
So took it in to a really good Chevy dealership, which they have been really helpful with everything, and since then it's been a month because the warranty has not been helpful at all. To put the name out there, the warranty is called ""Veritas Global Protection"". (Never go for this warranty!)

So it's been a month already and this warranty keeps canceling the claim. I've already went through two leakdown tests and diagnostics and I have not gotten to a conclusion about this issue. It was stated from the beginning that this was an engine issue and that it had to be taken apart but this warranty seems to be dragging everything. I called them today because they keep canceling my claim and they have treated me very bad, calling me stupid and everything, and this time im not going to let them treat me that way.
So from what they said, they basically said that they wanted to do everything form the beginning again. S do tests and diagnostics all over again because I don't know why.

I'm not going to pay for all of that again and the tests that they made me do 2 twice showed no issue from what they originally wanted to see. I have a video where it shows how bad the engine is moving and the sound that can be heard coming from the engine.
They also wanted a test done with a glove put on the exhaust and I will show the video here, but since l don't know why they even wanted that test to be done can someone explain it. There seemed to be no issues with those tests but they want everything to be done again which I'm not doing.

They sent an inspector the first time I had put out the claim, which was a month ago, but they then later lied on all of the information and today I told them that if they didn't like the tests that were done by this mechanic, that I wanted them to send out a mechanic and do everything themselves because I'm already annoyed by all of this. And they said that they wouldn't sent out one as they had already sent out an inspector which I replied saying that yes, they did sent out one, but they then later lied with the information. They sent out the inspector and the inspector told the Chevy mechanic that a noise was present and that it might need to get a new engine and the warranty later lied that they didn't receive this information.

I want to see if I can move on and take legal action cause I've had enough. They are dragging this and I don't want to pay for more stupid tests that I don't need. I do need help and I will provide some videos.",0,1760976906.0,7,carproblems,1761075307,2025-10-20 16:15:06,2025-10-21 19:35:07,"mlw35405 (Score: 2): You have an exhaust manifold leak (i see missing/broken bolts).You have a bad motor mount.

1obh786,Vehicle repair,"
Hello, all. I have to admit, I'm embarrassed to have to type this, let alone post it, but here I am. I really need help getting my vehicle out of the repair shop ($3,416.73‚Ä¶the work has been completed). I have a full time job, but I'm currently not being paid due to furlough. I have a backup vehicle and I started using it to drive for Amazon to make extra cash during this time, but it also needs work now. I've applied for several jobs (22 and counting) until I am back at work, to no avail. I know I'll likely be ridiculed here. It‚Äôs easier for many to be negative versus positive. It takes a heck of a lot to ask for help from anyone, let along strangers.
I've asked those close to me, only to be chastised or worse. What's worse is they were some of the same people helped when they were down.
I know getting another vehicle may be some responses, but it's not that easy for me. Plus the cost of a new vehicle is greater than the repair cost. Plus, I can't say when I'll be paid again. People are ""close"" to you or a ""friend"" until you really need them. Family included. It‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt use the word ‚Äúfriend‚Äù loosely. If I‚Äôm your friend, I‚Äôm just that. Through thick and thin. I know this is on me and as a full grown man, I'm supposed to be in a better place. I understand that more than you could possibly know, but it doesn't change where I am currently (and we all have a story). I won't always be here. I refuse to. I‚Äôm raising a little person to be an exceptional young man, but for now, transportation is important.
To make things worse or stoop even lower, I attempted to find a sugar momma for help (as if that's a thing). If you're able to help, please see information below. If you'd prefer calling the repair shop, please reach out and I can give you that information as well.
Please, positive vibes only. I promise I've had enough bad. We are our worse critics, and I‚Äôve beat myself up more than anyone else can. Thank you all for reading, and I sincerely apologize for making this. I guess desperation.

1obrozn,2014 Ford escape 1.6 ecoboost turbo replacement,"I just got this vehicle as a project car. Engine sounds fine, runs smooth. The turbo was obviously (audibly - grinding noises) bad. Leaked oil from the turbo area like a sieve.

Bought a $150 Amazon ""prime"" turbo and oil return line. Installed turbo. Passed on return line replacement after inspection of original.

Started vehicle. Minimal smoke, smooth running engine. After warming it up and driving it around (with lots of oil smoke - based on smell and color) parked and idled it. A little bit of smoke at idle, but when hitting the gas, significant increase in oil smoke.

After doing some more research, my assumption is that this is potentially (probably?) a PCV valve issue. I'm getting ready to order that and install it. My understanding is that I will have to pull the intake manifold to install the new PCV valve.

Any other ideas on what is the highest probability cause for this problem? Or, if you agree that the first thing I should do is the PCV valve, tricks to make it easier?

Thanks!

Potentially important facts: I bought this vehicle with the turbo problem from an auction. I have no idea how long the problem existed.

1obq2yg,Need help to identify transmission Issue with ford focus 2014,"To start off, I dont know anything about anything about cars, so im sorry if i sound ignorant. I do know however the ford focus from 2012-2016ish had a weird and very faulty dual clutch transmission.   
  
Ill tell you the symptoms  
Check engine light came on, Transmission Fault Service Now, bright red.  
Ill drive for a while, stop, when i try to drive again the rpms will go up but the car wont actually move.  
Breaking all the way and then trying again will usually get the car going again.  
It takes a LOT more Rpms to get it going any type of speed, like 4000 rpms just to drive at 20mph, if that sounds normal then i guess 8000 rpms just think double the rpms it usually needs  
When it shifts gears the car will sometimes violently jerk. (And no, its not the usual problem where the car will have issues shifting gears after coming to a stop this is different, now its doing this while accelerating)

If it helps any the car is at 140,000 miles, ive owned it for about 3 years, I started with about 100,000 miles, and about 20-25,000 of those miles are highway miles. Other than my current issues ive never had any trouble with this car.

I havent driven since the issues showed up since I know transmissions are a big deal, this is all info found within maybe 10-15 miles of drive time

  
Ive took it to a trusted mechanic whos a family friend, he used the little fault checking machine, he couldnt find any definitive answers from the codes he got, but his best guess is that it might need either a new clutch, tcm replacement, or less likely it needs new transmission fluid.  
But other than that he didnt know what could specifically be wrong with the car.

Does this sound like any specific issue somebody has encountered? Any kind of help identifying the problem would be much appreciated, Also, no there is no valid warranty for the tcm or transmission or anything except some kind of cannister, ive checked with the dealership and either way i bought it from a person not a dealership.

If you want it done better, find a powdercoating shop to sandblast them for you for like $150 and even consider their powdercoating service. But that also requires you to pay a tire shop to dismount then remount the tires.

Assess the vehicle, for what could be the simplest/easiest/cheapest part to swap that could result in the vehicle being salvaged titled (It might depend on state youre in for what would be best). find a compatible vehicle at the junkyard. Take pics of the vehicle, of the part, take pics of the VIN, maybe also take a pencil rubbing imprint of the VIN for good measure. Remove the part. Buy the part from the yard. Keep the receipt.

Viola! Now you have a paper trail that the salvage inspection guy is trained to demand to see. If you dont know what else was replaced, and have no way to find out, he cant either. The pencil rubbing and receipt probably arent needed. Have them anyways. say 'do you need this vin rubbing and receipt?' Its an intentionally dumb question. Its likely to give the inspector the attitude that you are extra cautious and prepared, and that you have 'more than enough' proof.

He just needs to check the box that: a part that caused salvaged title was replaced and now passes inspection and the VIN is compatible as required by law. So doing what i said will produce that for him. 

*DONT TELL ON YOURSELF*. DON'T tell the inspector that other repairs were done. DON'T ask if replacing something else was good enough. The default answer in bureaucracy is no, even if its legally yes. so just do it. Even if it doesnt pass, for whatever reason, let him figure that out and tell you why. by keeping your mouth shut, you avoid suspicion of fraud, and retain plausible deniability. If he somehow says ""hey, the computer says the airbag popped, and i see its been replaced, i need the VIN for that also."", then you just tell some of the truth. ""oh...i didnt know that. I'll contact the guy that repaired it and ill come back another time with that for you' then shut up and be on your way. 

If you need to, repeat the process for whatever other parts he needs to see VINs for. Note, you dont even need to swap these parts again. Just buy them, hold onto them for a while until you get your title and other paperwork sorted, then return them or ebay them or chuck em in the trash...or keep as spares.

Work the system, dont let it work you.

DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT A LAWYER, THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE. 

Again, this is not necessarily what the state wants you to do, it is what I would do, and this type of mentality of feeding the bureaucratic machine the boxes it is designed to check has served me well, even when the boxes are superfluous and stupid.

Caster helps vehicles track straight, and returns the wheel to center coming out of a turn.

The only real and valid way to test a battery is to disconnect/remove it from the vehicle, charge it for 12-24 hours and then let it rest for another 12-24 hours. Then you can check the voltage and if it‚Äôs still resting above a certain point (depends on battery type) then you can load test it. If it passes both, it‚Äôs good. If it fails one, it‚Äôs bad.

Now, you could very well have a faulty alternator or bus signal to the alternator. This can cause an intermittent issue that can eventually lead to a flat and/or dead battery. Pumping your fuel would have no impact on the battery.

However, the biggest cause of failure for modern batteries is people that take short trips. Especially in the winter. If you start your car and drive it 3 minutes to the gas station, you haven‚Äôt even replenished the battery with what you took from it to start the vehicle. So, you start it again and then drive another 5 minutes‚Ä¶then again another 5-10 minutes home. You likely haven‚Äôt charged the battery back to the point of its initial start, or possibly to or just over that point. Then you do it again and again and again‚Ä¶eventually this leads to a flat battery which can lead to a dead battery which will strain the alternator and can cause that to fail as well.

I‚Äôm a girl and this is my first car, so I‚Äôm still learning about car maintenance please be patient if I get something wrong üòÖ

I have a 2013 Honda Accord LX 2.4L around 120k miles, and I‚Äôve recently been dealing with a rattling noise from the engine that started right after an oil change.  
Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs been going on:

# What happened

* The car was running totally fine with 5W-20 oil.
* During my last oil change, I switched to 0W-20 full synthetic, thinking it would be better for fuel economy (I didn‚Äôt realize it could affect the sound).
* After that, I started hearing a metallic rattle.
* I switched to 5W-30, hoping a thicker oil would help.
* The sound didn‚Äôt go away completely, but it changes depending on temperature.

Is it safe to keep driving it?

What could be wrong with my engine? my boyfriend says a thicker oil could solve it something like 10w20/30?

Edit. This is the sound. 

At first, it's louder; then it goes away, and later you can hear it faintly again.

Put good quality 5-20 full synthetic back in it.  Could be the oil filter too.  Too tight, the wrong kind.  That rattle noise often dry start on vvt cam gears, or their actuators bc that system operates on oil pressure.   Filter has to have an anti drain back valve,.

I thought it was the spark plugs, the shop said they checked the sparkplugs and diagnosed as the distributor. I paid $90 for diagnostic, $528 for the distrubor, $270 for labor.

Picked the car up while they were closed and still had problems. It ran enough for me to get home and then stopped running again. Took it to my local mechanic (works on fleet vehicles and runs independently on the side) who has worked on the car for years. The new distributor (which they definitely upcharged me for) also wasn't working, so we replaced it with another (for $320). We still had problems so he ran a full diagnostic and realized that it was actually the spark plugs the entire time. He also says the diagnostic will give faulty readings if the sparkplugs aren't working. So what could have actually just been a $200 problem became a $1200 one.

Called the first shop to get a full refund. They refuse because I went to a local guy instead of bringing it back to them to fix or going to a real shop. I told them I couldn't bring it back, becuase they were out of town and the car wasn't working. The most they are offering to pay is $528 for the distributor, if I bring it back. But not the labor.

I was in a car accident in April, had a mechanic that I'd used before pick up the car and take it to his shop. He suggested I pay him for the parts upfront as its a big job and they take time to order in so I did (¬£5000+). 

Couple months went by and he was still ""waiting for parts"", eventually I started to question things more and went to his garage to find his garage closed but a van still outside in the middle of a weekday which was odd but nonetheless I looked and company still active on companies house too so I thought little off it. 

He kept replying in short blurts about a week or 2 apart - I figured to buy time so I was very patient with him. However he set a date and missed it so I demanded to see the car which he avoided. Alarm bells started ringing as I continued to ask to see the progress and he started saying he needs more parts (this is 4 months in now)... Eventually he sent me a location of the car where he'd dumped it and has since gone radio silent. 

I've since taken it to another garage who wanted nothing to do with it suggesting I start all over again getting a new front end assembly(?)

1. Performance: On the highway it really struggles to get up to 120 km/h. I have to press the accelerator quite a bit just to maintain speed, and it feels slow to climb. Is this a common issue with these Golfs, or could something specific be wrong (like fuel, gearbox, or timing related)?


2. Water leak: It‚Äôs also leaking water into the cabin ‚Äî mainly in the middle section and on the passenger side. It looks like it‚Äôs coming through the air/fan ducts. I took some photos to show where it‚Äôs coming in.



Just wanted to ask if anyone‚Äôs experienced similar problems or might know what to look for or check first.

1. Replace that exhaust pipe section. The part is [https://www.autodoc.co.uk/walker/18101873](https://www.autodoc.co.uk/walker/18101873) Someone earlier on here mentioned that the rest of the exhaust pipes may break and require the whole exhaust system to be replaced.
2. Have a garage weld the rods back onto the exhaust pipe where there is a thicker area for that (original place).
3. Fix the rods to the pipe in some other way. Wire wrapping would probably work but would probably rust through within a year.

Any recommendations? Is the exhaust pipe difficult to change on a driveway or does the whole car need to be hoisted up to access the end at the engine side?

1ob8h4q,"Is it bad that my exhaust is touches my gas tank on my 2012 Nissan Murano? If so, how can I fix it?","I needed two new mufflers for my 2012 Nissan Murano (3.5L auto transmission). I got quoted $1200 from the local shop, then I realized that I could do it myself with a few bolt-on parts and no welding.  

I bought a stainless steel exhaust kit from Rock Auto, which included everything behind the catalytic converter in two pieces. The first piece was the the front muffler with the pipe attached on either end, pre-bent to line up with the cat in front and the rear muffler in back. The second piece was the rear muffler and tailpipes attached. 

The front piece was so annoying to install. The pre-bent shape wasn't perfect. I had to set it on the floor and push it to bend it more, and then wrestle the back end to make it line up with the flange for the rear exhaust. After struggling like hell, I got it on.

A few months later, I took the car into my mechanic for something else and they told me that the exhaust was touching the gas tank, and that is bad. Well, yes, I knew it was touching, but I didn't know it was bad. The shop said I would need a new exhaust system.

Is this a known issue with pre-made exhaust kits like the one purchased? How would someone go about fixing it? Do you think that I would really need to install a whole new exhaust system?

installed a new battery, a new alternator and checked the major grounds as well, they seem fine the major ones being the battery to the chassis(strut tower), frame to the block.

Vehicle has a solid rear crossmember and rear drum brakes. Backing plate (#4) depiction is misleading because the wheel cylinder and brake shoes are anchored to it.

Backing plate and hub assembly attach to the crossmember with one set of bolts from behind. Unfortunately the hub assembly is seized to the backing plate. When I remove the bolts, both fall off together.

Can't use a hub puller and slide hammer because the hub assembly would just be ripped apart. Can't pull them off and work on them off the vehicle because the wheel cylinder (with solid metal brake line) and parking brake cable still run through the backing plate. Can't pop out a wheel stud and run a long bolt through the hole to pry the hub assembly off the backing plate because there is no flange position that would allow such a bolt to contact the backing plate squarely.

And worst of all, I can't destroy and replace the (right-hand) backing plate, because (1) the part (44020-ED360) is discontinued; (2) there is no Dorman/similar aftermarket equivalent; and (3) the *only* reputable place I can find the part is from 3 eBay sellers who would be shipping from Japan with a month lead time.

Passenger side blows hot, driver side does not. I checked blend door actuators, burped the system as best I could with a spill free funnel. Bled air out on the thermostat. 

I opened radiator on cool engine and noticed a bit of a shimmer, freaked myself out and convinced myself it's a blown head gasket. I've got a thermostat coming and going to swap that. Aside from flushing again is there anything I can do? That'll be done when I do the thermostat. 

Also anyway to check for a blown head gasket? Engine temps are fine, haven't even seen over 195f on ten minute test drives and hard acceleration. 

Thanks in advance, sorry for wall of text. 

TLDR: flushed system, checked actuators, bled air out, no heat still. Changing thermostat and re flushing in a few days hoping that solves it.

1obv9vc,Considering replacing our ICE with a PHEV ‚Äî worth it or not?,"Hey all,

Looking for some advice from people who‚Äôve been through this decision.

Currently, my partner and I share two cars:

* **One full EV**¬†(which we absolutely love)
* **One ICE (petrol)**¬†car

We use the EV for about¬†**80% of our journeys**¬†‚Äî all the local commutes, errands, and day trips. It‚Äôs quiet, cheap to run, and fits our daily routine perfectly. The¬†**ICE only gets used about 20% of the time**, mainly for the occasional long journeys ‚Äî maybe¬†**two or three times a year**¬†‚Äî when we need to travel several hundred miles or carry bulky equipment on the roof. In those cases, the convenience of petrol refilling wins out versus planning charging stops.

We‚Äôve been talking about going¬†**fully electric**, but those few long trips are holding us back. I‚Äôm now considering¬†**replacing the ICE with a plug-in hybrid (PHEV)**¬†as a middle ground ‚Äî mostly to:

* Reduce fuel use on shorter trips
* Still have petrol range for the rare long hauls
* Ease the transition to full EV later

However, I‚Äôve heard mixed things about PHEVs ‚Äî from people saying they‚Äôre the¬†*‚Äúworst of both worlds‚Äù*¬†to others claiming they‚Äôre perfect for mixed usage like ours.

So, for anyone who‚Äôs been in a similar spot:

* Did switching from ICE ‚Üí PHEV make sense for you?
* How‚Äôs the real-world EV range and charging convenience?
* Any regrets or hidden downsides?

Would love to hear your experiences before taking the plunge!",0,1760997784.0,5,CartalkUK,1761075307,2025-10-20 22:03:04,2025-10-21 19:35:07,"silentdragoon (Score: 5): What in the ai generated heck

1obupsl,Dealer is refusing to refund road tax that they didn‚Äôt set up,"To give full context, I traded my car in for a newer one. Dealer didn‚Äôt have the V5 so they used Motor Admin Services online to V62 and pay the Road Tax.

I specifically requested that the Road Tax be paid 12 months in full and sent the ¬£165 on top of what I paid for the car. Fast forward 4 weeks later after the V5 arrives in the post but the car was still showing as untaxed. 

Contacted DVLA twice and they said there is no pending application for Road Tax on the car. Contacted the dealer who said it‚Äôs simply not possible for the V5 to be sorted but not the tax so they said they‚Äôll contact Motor Admin Services and get back to me. 

Contacted them myself and they responded almost instantly saying they were instructed to set up a direct debit but the details supplied were rejected hence why the car was still showing untaxed. I didn‚Äôt even supply the dealer my bank details to do this. 

Dealer absolutely insists that they did not request a direct debit be set up and paid for the road tax in full but hasn‚Äôt supplied any proof to support this claim. Not wanting to run the risk of being pulled over by the police while driving an untaxed car, I taxed the car using my new V5. 

Contacted Motor Admin Services again and asked them to check the direct debit details that were used to set up and the details supplied were 100% not my details. At this point it is clear that the dealer has tried to set up the direct debit using their details which didn‚Äôt work so the money is still with the dealer. I‚Äôve asked multiple times to be refunded now that I‚Äôve paid twice over but dealer has refused every request insisting that tax was paid in full, again not one shred of proof given.

Any advice on how I would pursue this further if the dealer still refuses to refund me?

More info:
27y/o (M) and I'm mentioning this because by the time I'm out of this car I'll be 30 as the duration is 3 years.

Started the job this year and it's going great. Recently I got offered to get a company car which will really help overall with the nature of the job and what it's going to turn into eventually. Currently at R&D phase but once the product is out I will be the main person responsible for driving across the UK and maintaining the product at adopted locations. I'm predicting some days might require circa of 300ish miles of driving. 

Currently I work from home most days but my commute to the office is 120 miles round trip and to our test site 180 miles round trip. I also have a second part time job which requires similar milage but that's on occasion and I have access to another car I can use for doing that. 

My concerns lie with the fact that I am not settled, currently renting with 100% chance of moving within the period of owning this car, and I don't have a reliable way to charge a car if I go for a pure electric one (for lower tax reasons).

I did some heavy research on BiK tax and what owning a company car costs, plus reading my company car contract 5 times before even considering it and I've stopped on a Seat Leon Estate FR Sport eHybrid PHEV, mainly because it's price of about ¬£40,000 free colour choice and fantastic built in spec list on top of having a great ev range (70+) which puts it in the lower % BiK tax bracket.

After doing the math in taxes I would end up paying around ¬£3,000 for the 3 year of ownership (that's including the % increases each following year) which I am more than happy with as the company covers maintenance, tyres, insurance and road tax which is about what I would be paying to maintain a car on the road anyway, but without the headache of something unexpected happening.

My current company car is a plug in hybrid and my company give me a fuel card, so I pay my private mileage back to the company. That means however it isn‚Äôt actually cost effective to charge at home and it‚Äôs ran on the petrol engine 90% of the time and charged up using the engine as you drive for a bit of electric when in towns etc. 

Something to bear in mind however, is the BIK rate will be lower until April 2028. After then, regardless of range all plug in hybrids move to a flat rate of 18% BIK. 

In terms of charging, it isn‚Äôt usually efficient to charge a Plug in hybrid using public chargers as they often can‚Äôt take rapid charging. 

Company cars can be great, you have no insurance or maintenance to worry about. Electric obviously is cheaper on tax, but that‚Äôll not last forever and isn‚Äôt always practical for everyone.

1oblknf,Advice needed for classic or future-classic big saloon,"Have been thinking about taking the plunge and getting a classic (>40 year old, heritage) or future-classic big saloon as a main car. Yes, as a main car. I'm not yet sure whether I want to do it, but I'm tired of all the AI/H&S nonesense in new cars and the pricing is ridiculous. The car wouldn't get much use, but would need to go into London (ULEZ exempt) - so heritage status works out. 

  
These are the cars I've been thinking about:

\- Last generation V8 Lexus LS. Not really quite a future classic, but a crisp and tidy LS460 would be reliable and comfortable. Could even import one from Japan. Previous LS430 owner, enjoyed that thoroughly. 

\- A first gen Bentley Mulsanne. These are about 40k. I don't know if they're ULEZ exempt, and I don't know if it's possible to get Carplay working somehow. Anyone have experience with one of these? Are they a money pit?

\- A classic Rolls, like a Shadow. I take it these are a complete money pit. 

\- A classic S class or equivalent model type from that time, over 40 years of age. I'd imagine these are pricey. 

\- A V12 760iL - the penultimate shape ones are getting quite cheap. Again not strictly a future classic, but they're interesting. Are they are money pit? 

\- Last gen V12 Toyota Century. 

  
Any advice, thoughts or suggestions? Just sick to death of modern cars - everything post 2015 feels like a joke. All I want is space, comfort, AC, and car-play (retrofit is fine) - the more reliable the better. No AI/H&S nannies.

However I can highly recommend a LS430, it was very low cost for me to maintain and ULEZ compliant. If you want CarPlay, a post 04 version with nav is a lot more straightforward to retrofit using the existing screen. 

You would need to look into the Century‚Äôs NOx emissions but if it‚Äôs ULEZ compliant you will need to go through a similar process as an import LS or Celsior, but I like this over anything Rolls and Bentley could offer due to the robust Toyota engineering. 

As to an old S-class you‚Äôll be looking at a W116/126, which I have owned the latter. You will spend most of your time hunting down parts, as MB have really wound back what they stock these days and are a lot harder to find S-class only components than W114/115/123/124 parts. If you are playing with ¬£40k, why not go for a W124 500E/E500? That‚Äôs a solid classic already and due to its unique manufacturing situation, being too wide for Sindelfingen, it was completed on the Zuffenhausen line, so it‚Äôs become a cult icon.

1oblaud,Super confused regarding car breakdown - looking for some advice?,"Apologies if wrong sub.  I'm at an absolute loss on how to proceed her.  Never had any car troubles so this whole process is new to me and as a bit of a self-confessed loner I don't have much in the ways of nearby advice.

So I live in Scotland.  I purchased a vehicle from England and took out extended Warranty - of which said company also comes from England.

On Saturday I noticed my car had a Coolant low warning.  I went to top it up and noticed it was EMPTY.  So I filled it up and checked under the car to find the Coolant pissing out the bottom.

Contacted my car dealership (mostly because I'd mentioned low coolant to them way back when purchased) and they passed me to Warranty company, who said don't do any work until a Diagnostic is done.  Now here's where my issue is.  Earliest I can get a Diagnostic done is next Thursday making the actual repair likely weeks away, and I will need a car before then.  So I figured I'll contact my Admiral insurance in hopes I could go about seeking a Courtesy car, I explain the situation and ask for advice.  They have directed me to the Breakdown cover line.  I have tried both the website and phone line and both of these read/sound as though it's Emergency Breakdown cover - I do not require any Emergency assistance as the car is parked cosy at home while i'm at work.  I'm also concerned that should I go ahead and contact them anyway and hopefully explain the situation - that they'd end up trying to do on-site repairs (I don't know extent of damage) at which point Warranty will be able to say they didn't authorize it.

I realise this is an awful long read for someone whos probably just being paranoid/dumb but figured I'd throw it out there in hopes anyone could offer some advice.  As I say, i'm lost and just trying to keep myself right.

Thanks,

That is, the amount you have to spend to get the car back to a decent enough state so that it will pass an MOT.

The other factors are that you won't have to change insurance, tax, or go searching for a new car and potentially end up with something that's no better - or worse - than what you have.

The car might only have a *resale* value of ¬£500 but that's kind of irrelevant when you only have to spend ¬£700 to put it right.

Because even if you could get the full ¬£500 for it (and believe me, you will have people offering you ¬£100 to take it off your hands, which is less than scrap value BTW) and you take your ¬£700 you'd have ¬£1200 to buy something else which is not going to uplevel your car by that much.

So I would say if everything else is okay with the car, and you trust it and it's been generally reliable for you, then ¬£700 seems like money well spent to keep it running for another 2-3 years.

When it starts to get into the realms of a grand or two to put it right or you start having to spend ¬£700 every 6-12 months, then you'll probably want to consider your options.

The type of driving I do is predominantly short, around-town journeys during the week. Then, every couple of weeks, I'll do a return 100-mile each-way journey. I'll also do two very long drives, possibly to Europe, during the year. But most daily driving is around town.

So, I want something with a bit of oomph. I'm going to go out on a limb and say 200 brake minimum. Four-wheel drive or all-wheel drive would be lovely. It also needs to be comfortable and good fun to drive. Am I asking for too much?

I did look at the 435D. I'm open to suggestions.

1obb7nl,Rear wheel steer.  Can it tow?,"I‚Äôm looking at getting an Audi Q7 with Rear (all) wheel steering. It‚Äôs going to be used for towing.

Because of the way this affects the back of the car (and it‚Äôs a Quattro), does it tow normally?

As has been said, your best bet is starting from scratch and doing lessons before applying for a UK licence.
