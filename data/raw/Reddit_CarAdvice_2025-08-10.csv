1mm3ksg,brake troubles and loose part,"2015 Nissan Altima. I recently started having brake troubles-- the brake pedal was occasionally pulsating, especially when going up and down hills, down the highway exit ramp, etc. I took the car to a local brake shop and they said the front brake rotors were warped, rear brakes were worn, and so they did front and rear brake replacement and brake fluid service.

About a month later (<50 miles driven), when I went on the highway for the first time since having them replaced, the same issue started occurring-- pulsating brake pedal when exiting the highway. I also noticed a slight rattling while driving, before braking. Took the car back and they replaced the front brakes again.

1mm3kst,Dealer won’t fix interior rattle under warranty,"Bought a new Nissan in April. Since a few days after driving it off the lot, it’s had a very irritating dash rattle that occurs anytime I drive on a road that’s not silky smooth. I can also hear it when I’m stopped next to a car with a powerful engine. The vibration the other car makes causes the rattle to get real loud.

Brought it to the dealer I purchased it from three times. First time, they claimed they couldn’t hear it. Second time, they did hear it, mentioned that they smacked the glovebox and seat, and it went away. Third time, they again acknowledged that they could hear it, but that because it is located inside the dash, they didn’t want to remove the dash out of fear of creating other rattles. They also said that because I purchased an economy car, I should expect rattles and get used to them. If we were talking about a 10 year old Sentra, I’d get it. But I literally drove off their lot with it 16 weeks ago, so this comment kind of irked me.

I escalated it with Nissan Canada, and the management of the dealer group that owns this particular dealership, and basically said I’m going to bring it in again and expect it to be rectified or I’ll have it repaired by a 3rd party mechanic and take them to small claims court for my costs.

Am I being unreasonable here? It literally sounds like a loose plastic clip rattling around beneath the dash, so I would think it would fall under the umbrella of “manufacturers defect”.

SuccessfulShame2473 (Score: 1): To address the problem, you should first check the condition of the belt if it’s old, glazed, or worn out, replace it because tightening won’t stop slipping if the belt is bad. Next inspect the belt tensioner pulley to make sure it moves freely and maintains proper tension. If the tensioner is weak or stuck it needs to be repaired or replaced. Then examine the alternator pulley and bearings to ensure they spin smoothly and are securely attached, especially since remanufactured alternators can sometimes have internal issues. After that, clean and tighten all battery terminals, alternator output cables, and engine ground straps to eliminate any corrosion or loose connections that could cause voltage drops. Since your audio setup draws a lot of current verify that your wiring gauge is sufficient and that your alternator’s output rating can handle the load; if it can’t consider upgrading. Finally use a multimeter to measure voltage at the battery terminals and alternator output with the engine running and under load if voltage drops below about 13.8 volts when the system is working then that indicates a charging problem that might require further alternator testing or replacement."

1mm2vz9,A/C not taking a charge,"Got a 2015 f150 5.0. I've had it since new. had to replace the compressor and repair a leak. I did all of the above, dumped shipping oil out of the new comp and added the exact amount and type of motorcraft PAG (all to the compressor). replaced the condenser with a new one (not OEM), and pulled a vacuum on the system. I have done I think 4 A/C repairs before so I have the gear to do it and at least a bit of know how. I usually pull the vacuum for 8-12 hours (overnight), then hook up my manifold gauges and charge it up on the low side, no issue. This time, I pulled the vacuum, let it sit 3 hours to confirm it was not leaking, then started the process of filling it. Takes 31 oz of 134-A. I'm using pure 134-A 12 oz cans from Walmart. I have an older brass tap for the cans. Turned the truck on, AC on full, and weighed/tapped the first can. Took 2.5 oz of refrigerant and pushed the low side gauge to 10psi. That's it. That's all it did. Compressor never turned on and it never took any more refrigerant. 

Ive checked the compressor clutch for function with a 12v battery, checked all of the related fuses I could find through forums, and replaced the relay. Have it drained, take it home and vacuum down, charge it up. 2.6ish oz and nothing else. Yes, all of the valves are opened and everything is block free as far as I can tell. High side pressure goes down when pulling a vacuum from low side and vice versa. Everything appears to be normal but it's just not taking any refrigerant. Any ideas what to check/look at.

1mm2flt,Need help diagnosing repeated electrical issues (Alternator / Battery / Battery Sensor),"2016 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport

Our vehicle has had... many issues with the electrical system since it was purchased a few years ago. For context, it was bought used with around 30k miles. The issues started popping up around ~50k miles. Here's a quick breakdown:

* Mid 2022 - The car needed regular jumps and we found battery to be low voltage. Replaced battery.
* Mid 2022 - This did not fix the issue, so took to a mechanic chain. Alternator replaced with remanufactured part.
* Early 2024 - Issues with low voltage / needing jumps started back up, replaced battery again.
 * This still did not fix the issue - vehicle needed a jump if left sitting for more than 4-5 days. We just assumed it was normal at this point, so didn't look into it any further.
* Mid 2024 - Had airbag system error code pop. Local mechanic did a quick inspection and said likely a sensor issue, not actual airbag/safety issue. They cleared the code. It popped back up once every few months, but we didn't think too much of it.
* Mid 2025 - Had a transmission error code also pop up, so took into a dealership for a paid diagnostic on both issues. The shop determined the both issues were caused by a battery flow sensor and a terminal with high resistance, so they replaced both and said the issues were resolved.


That brings us to this week. Less than a month after that sensor was replaced, we ran into the airbag error code again. A day later, we found the vehicle dead.

I popped the hood and found some corrosion on the terminals which I cleaned and then checked with a multimeter. It was sitting at 9.7v while off. We jumped it and found it at just over 14v while idling. I assumed these were signs of a dead battery, so took to a Pep Boys/AutoZone/O'Reilly. They broke out the battery tester and it indicated the issue is the alternator, not battery.

My question is this - what is the likelihood that the alternator was already failing and the dealer misdiagnosed the problem? We paid just over $500 in parts+labor for the sensor, terminal, and a ""0-66-0 test"" on the airbag system. If the issue was the alternator, it seems to me that they did not diagnose it correctly and charged us for work that was not necessary.

Something just feels off about the whole situation and, given my limited knowledge, I wanted to get some extra eyes on it. Two alternators, two batteries, and a battery flow sensor in <40k miles driven feels like we've been screwed over by multiple mechanics + the multiple shops that tested and then sold us the new batteries.",1,1754779257.0,2,MechanicAdvice,1754854475,2025-08-09 22:40:57,2025-08-10 19:34:35,"SuccessfulShame2473 (Score: 1): It’s possible the alternator was failing or partially failing when dealer replaced sensor/terminal, and they missed it.

Concerns: Given the history, I suspect an intermittent or partial alternator failure might have been missed during previous diagnostics.
Multiple replacements of batteries and alternators, along with recurring electrical error codes, suggest a possible parasitic drain, wiring issue, or alternator malfunction.
Corroded terminals and sensor replacements may have masked the underlying charging or electrical system problem.

The boat runs really good until about 26 mph. After that point the boat will run faster speeds for about a minute or less and then cough and die. 

Some potential problems I think are occurring are

1. Vacuum leak on gasket or lines
2. Bad fuel supply (we put a new fuel pump on last year, so I’m doubtful)
3.  Poor float level

 i have been putting on 10 micron fuel filters before the mechanical fuel pumps for 40 years on cars and trucks.. 

 https://i.imgur.com/WHbbn4N.jpg like this..

 with the filter installed.. i disconnect the ignition so it cannot spark.. disconnect the fuel line to the carb and stick it in a clean clear plastic soda bottle..   crank for 15 seconds.. stop.. do this 2 more times.. 

 test the fuel pressure.. you should hold fuel pressure for many minutes..  i pulled the holley off a friends 347.. it had not been cranked or started in 5 days.. fuel shot out all over my hands.. yes.. 10 micron fuel filter before the pump.. 

 i would expect in a boat. you have some kind of decent fuel filter before the pump.. 

 does your new carb have billet metering plates??  is this the carb you have??? it says it has easily changeable idle feed restricitons..

 with a 351 cubic inch engine.. its likely to have 0.031 Idle feed restrictions.. change to 0.032"" idle feed restrictions.. 

 change to a 71 primary main jet.. 

 change to a 32 or 33 primary accelerator pump discharge nozzle.. 

 why... the friend i pulled his carb off his 347.. i worked with his carb primary jetting and primary idle feed restrictions..  he had the street version of that carb.. he came back from a short test drive with the biggest smile on his face.. 

 you may have to look at the secondary Air fuel ratio above 5500 rpm to see which way you need to go with the secondary metering plate.. to get the air fuel ratio under load around 12.7.. not too lean.. not too rich.. 

  this may not be possible with a wet exhaust.. if you don't have bungs for oxygen sensors.. 

 the 0.032 idle feed restriction gets you to 1800 RPM .. the 71 primary main jet takes you from 2400 to 4000 rpm. .  above 4000 the secondaries start to open and the primary is maxed out. the secondary tuning is now needed.. so many shops try to correct WOT air fuel ratio by going to bigger primary main jets.. this kills low speed power as its too rich.."

I purchased a new compressor condenser and expansion valve. I’m into the repair, bumpers off old compressors off. The new compressor has an oil capacity of 2.7 ounces from rock auto pre-oiled. From what I’ve read I should dump out this oil and replace with pag 46 anyway so that’s my plan. According to the research I found the entire system takes about 5.0 to 5.5 ounces of pag 46 oil. My question is I’m replacing the condenser and expansion as well as the compressor so should I overfill the compressor over its printed capacity of 2.7 ounces and maybe put whatever it would take to make it 5.0 oz give or take or do I add oil directly into the condenser before installation…or somewhere else to more evenly distribute? Where else can I add oil if need be to do this right. I don’t wanna damage the new compressor by overfilling it I’m not sure how it all works as far as circulating through the system.

A manual pressure gauge was reading the same, saying there was almost no oil pressure. When he connected a basic scanner to it, it says oil pressure gauge and engine misfire, which he doesn’t seem concerned about. He bought new spark plugs but hasnt put them in yet. The pressure reads fine from  cold start, but drops when the engine reaches temp. The pressure also comes up when he revs the engine. When he looked in the engine, he thought the squeaking might’ve been from the idle pulley because it looked like it needed to be replaced. He replaced it and nothing changed. He drained the oil and saw only a few specs of silver, but not anything abnormal for breaking in the new engine. He bought an oil pump but is dreading replacing it because it’s very labor intensive. He called someone about it and they recommended using a thicker oil.  When he did a full oil change using the thicker oil, the pressure came up to 40, staying the same at temp. After a little bit it dropped to 30 but didn’t go any lower. It still went up when he revved the engine. After this, it started making a light rattling sound. I wouldn’t think it would be a bearing issue with the engine being so new.

1mm0htk,Jetta AC shuts off while driving at constant speed,"TL;DR: I have a 2015 Jetta 1.2 TSI. Over 80 km/h, when driving at a constant speed, the AC compressor shuts off. It turns back on when I lift my foot off the accelerator. Tester shows: ""Shut off from engine control module via CAN"". Nobody knows what the problem is.

I have a 2015 VW Jetta 1.2 TSI. When driving steadily above 80 km/h (keeping the accelerator just enough to maintain speed) or when accelerating, the air conditioning compressor stops. It restarts instantly when I lift my foot off the accelerator and go into engine braking.

So far, I’ve been to my regular mechanic, two AC specialists, and a VW dealership amd nobody understands what’s happening. I should mention it’s not losing refrigerant, just replaced it just to be sure, and the pressure readings are within specs on the tester.

I ran the tester while driving. After a short time driving at constant speed (on the highway) above 80 km/h, I get: ""Shut off from engine control module via CAN"", no other errors, pressure and all other compressor parameters are fine. As soon as I lift my foot off the accelerator, the compressor instantly turns back on.

In the tests I’ve done, I noticed that when I lift my foot off, battery voltage increases (example: at constant speed it’s 12.8–12.9 V, when I fully lift off it’s 13.8 V - that’s when the A/C turns back on). I thought there might be a correlation. I tested the alternator and battery (alternator is perfectly fine, battery is 10 years old and original to the car), but everyone told me that’s not the problem and that the battery “still works.”

The VW dealership said there’s a system that shuts off the compressor under high load, but that means full throttle acceleration, which is not the case here, and they’ve never seen anything like this before.

1mlzpoo,2008 F250 Cabin Fuse 45 keeps popping.,"I started my truck and out of the blue, my ac blew for a second then stopped. 
I continued driving and noticed that my speedometer is stuck on 0 and my fuel gauge doesn’t move either. 

Realized my ac fans aren’t blowing but I can feel the cold air of the ac if I put the feet blower on. Still no fan blowing. 

I checked a bunch of fuses and noticed Fuse 45 was popped, I replaced it and turned the truck to ACC. The new fuse popped.

 do you see the starter relay number 30 upper left ...

 you need to find the service parts sticker and i have no idea where they are in that model...    its a white sticker.. could be inside the glove box. or in the spare tire well.. 

 there are actually 2 different ways of controlling the starter relay 30.. RPO LD8 or L26.  you need to know which one you have..

 with a highlighter marker you can mark which circuit you use.. 

  the LD8 system. the start relay pin 85 is connected directly to ground..  and the  pin 86 gets positive from the PCM on connector X1 cavity 26..  this turns on the start relay to turn on your starter..

 in the L26... start relay 85 is Negative controlled thru the PCM on connector X1 cavity 23.    start relay pin 86  get positive power thru ECM/Crank 1 fuse and the Power train relay 29. 

 the first thing i would do is remove start relay 30... remove the cover.. inspect the contacts to see if they are welded shut.. they are likely deep in a small square hole in the side with the cover removed..  you might try replacing that relay with a new one.. 

 but i would want you to create a flat tipped jumper wire to do some very careful testing.. the fuse block has small numbers written on it i hope.. jumping from the PIN 30 cavity to the PIN 87 cavity should cause the starter to engage.. 

 you may be able to wrap some muscle packaging tape if you have some to make a purse handle around the 40 Amp fuse 24... so you can yank it easily.. get somebody in the drivers seat.. turn the key on.. step on the brake..  lightly touch fuse 24 to the terminals and remove this should start the engine..

Ultimately we are trying to get most bolts to stretch elastically like a spring to hold them in place. Some bolts are stretched plastically and are permanently deformed(torque to yield bolt). Before we even think about torque, the friction between the bolt and the threads is going to have a huge affect on the end result. 

Static friction vs kinetic, you may notice that a bolt appears continue Torquing forever and you release the force off the torque wrench and only then you will feel the torque wrench click after you've stopped. I take a break on some bolts and then try again from a dead stop.

Lubricants will reduce friction and allow the bolt to stretch more given the same amount of torque and only should be used when indicated in service info.

Dirt/rust increases friction and reduces clamping force given the same amount of friction.

Finally what you asked, torque. The head of the bolt shouldn't matter all that much. Even if the head has some springyness to it. I've had 4 meters of extensions hooked up and although the extension twist and it takes longer to reach your torque spec, the perceived torque(twisting force) is the same at either end.

When you are Torquing at an angle with a u-joint the geometry has an insane impact on torque and the torque wrenches almost never get close to spec on our bench tester.

- probably not tires or wheel bearings, those will make noise regardless of what the rest of the drivetrain is doing.

after that, I tried turning on the overhead light (not sure if that's the right term) and it turned on incredibly dim, but then all of a sudden all of the lights switched off.

Problem first started about a month ago, while we were driving the car just stopped, it didn't stall, chug or give any indication that there was something wrong I just quit driving. Would not start, no crank, nothing, security light flashing, radio asking for pin. 
Had the car towed to the mechanic. They started it right up the next day, drove into the bay and were preforming some regular diagnostic tests, nothing was showing up as a problem. Then the van again just shut off. There is power everywhere, lights, locks, radio, power doors, all work. Just the security light blinking and nothing happens when we try to start it. Could not connect to the computer at all.
The next plan was to put the radio code in, knew this wouldn't work, but figured we would try it. 
They went in to put the code in, and it started right up. They started and ran the van all day long with zero issues, zero codes, nothing found. We went to pick it up, and it ran for 2 minutes before imobilizing once again. 
Got in touch with a locksmith, he suggested win module. Ordered and replaced a pre-programmed win. Car started and drove perfectly for 3 days, and the problem returned. 
Testing all the fuses and the MAP sensor input all of that shows good except all the ASD relay fuses read .7 with car on or off. Is this the issue? Or is that reading happening because it is actively in security mode? One other note, the dash indicates the car is in R no matter the gear it is actually in, and all dash lights come on and the bottom red box light indicator cycles through the image that's above, battery, and temp over and over.

The best way to diagnose this is going to require a scope and pressure kit. You'll want to pull the spark plugs, pressurize the coolant system and stick the scope down each cylinder to look for coolant leaks.     
White smoke and poor gas mileage with a strong smell of gas would lead me to believe it's probably a bad injector. You could run some injector cleaner through it, may have some success but likely little if it's stuck. Couple things you can do with the injectors, put a long screwdriver on them one at a time with the engine running. Use the screwdriver like a stethoscope, listen for clicking sound.

I’m not a mechanic, but I have mechanically inclined friends, and we can replace most things—I just need help figuring out what else could be causing the issue.

Symptoms: P0420 error code, very minimal power (intermittent at best), and the RPMs often don’t match the actual power output (high revs, low power).

A few days ago my car started being a little bumpy, usually going between 1st & 2nd gear, and sometimes slow to acceleration. 

They said my engine ignition system is broken so they need to replace the PCV valve. $75 for parts and labor, seems fair.

They also recommend I swap out my spark plugs, which seems really expensive. $192 for four spark plugs, $441 for labor. Is this a fair price? 

And Is it something I need to do? I'm not much of a car guy so I don't think I can do it myself. I live in LA if anyone has a mechanic or shop they like. Thanks!

1mlu96e,016 Toyota Camry – P0128 code + pink residue near radiator cap. Advice?,"Hey everyone,

I have a 2016 Toyota Camry (2.5L) that just threw a P0128 code (Coolant Temperature Below Thermostat Regulating Temperature). From what I’ve read, that usually points to the thermostat being stuck open.

When I popped the hood, I noticed the coolant level was low and there’s pink crusty residue around the radiator cap area (photo attached). I topped it off with the correct Toyota pink coolant, but I’m wondering if this means I have a leak somewhere, possibly at the radiator cap or a hose connection.

Questions:

1. Should I replace just the thermostat, or do the radiator cap and hoses at the same time?
2. Could this residue and low coolant be signs of a bigger issue, like a leaking water pump or radiator?
3. Is it safe to drive short distances until I get this fixed?

Thanks in advance for any advice!

1mlvjw2,"2016 Toyota Camry – P0128 code, low coolant pink residue. Advice?","Hey everyone,

I have a 2016 Toyota Camry (2.5L) that just threw a **P0128** code (Coolant Temperature Below Thermostat Regulating Temperature). From what I’ve read, that usually points to the thermostat being stuck open.

When I popped the hood, I noticed the **coolant level was low** and there’s **pink crusty residue** around the radiator cap area (photo attached). I topped it off with the correct Toyota pink coolant, but I’m wondering if this means I have a leak somewhere, possibly at the radiator cap or a hose connection.

Questions:

1. Should I replace just the thermostat, or do the radiator cap and hoses at the same time?
2. Could this residue and low coolant be signs of a bigger issue, like a leaking water pump or radiator?
3. Is it safe to drive short distances until I get this fixed?

Thanks in advance for any advice!

1mlvcq2,Any of the younger (<40) enthusiasts here into antique vehicles?,"The ""need for speed"" left me by the time I was in my mid-20s. The itch started in my teens when I slapped the supercharger from an SS Cobalt onto the 2.2 LS Cobalt. It was quick for what it was. But wasn't enough and several cars later I found the cheapest formula for going fast was a crotch rocket. I loved every second of riding, but quickly found out I was going to end up either dead or in jail. It also pretty well killed my enthusiasm for cars at that point where I hung it up too. 

I went through a few 90s-00s muscle cars for the next few years. I liked them, but I didn't love them. The '01 Camaro I bought ended up collecting dust in the garage whenever it stopped being the DD. I ended up selling that and just driving a normal old econobox for a while. One day I was driving along and saw an old Model A in front of me. It just caught my eye, I gave the guy the thumbs up, and he hit the ""ahooga"" horn. 

A couple weeks later, at the yearly classic car auction in my city, I saw an old Model A was on the auction block. I always go to the auction, but never registered to bid since the prices are generally outrageous. Apparently, nobody wants these things cause I ended up walking away with it in one bid at $5k. 

It was a solid 8/10 visually, just a few minor paint defects and needed a little interior work. But, mechanically it was kind of a mess. I spent the next 5 months going through everything and getting it perfectly mechanically sound top to bottom. It absolutely re-sparked the passion I'd lost, both driving and wrenching. 

Anyways, to make an already long story short. I joined a couple forums along the way and I'm pushing half the age of most of the guys on them.

Sometimes they're made of baffles. Sometimes they're made of screens. But they can get clogged and when they do instead of the oil dripping back down into the crankcase it'll be shunted into the air intake. 


White smoke is most likely unburnt diesel. So you may need to be retimed or have your injectors cleaned or replaced.

Body damage on the front left fender and fog light from a tree, and a whole lotta sensor problems (attached pics.) It won’t pass inspection in my state, and I was quoted almost 4k to fix the issues. Fuel sensor level something is broken, which means my gauge will read whatever the hell it want, no matter how much is actually in the tank. The ABS light is on because of an internal steering angle sensor that’s out or something (also attached a pic.). I believe that’s in conjunction with the traction control/ESP BAS light, which strangely makes my cruise control only work at 40/60/80 mph. I need to get at least 2 new tires for it, a rotation, and a new passenger side mirror because a trash can jumped out the road at me and knocked mine off. It’s being held in with a few wood screws right now.  Also in a pic is the E brake light on, as I’m driving, which was because of a fairly hard brake, oops. Read somewhere that could be low brake fluid, but I also know my brakes are trash as well. 

What I’m asking here is this:  is it honestly even worth trying to fix this thing?

I have a Fiat 124 Spider CS2 from 1979, the last carburetor version and I noticed that after driving it my clothes always smell like exhaust gases.

Do you have the same issue? If no, any idea what I could do?

I already ordered a carbon monoxide meter to see if there are any dangerous gases in the passenger area.

My wife says, her clothes don't smell after she's been in the passenger seat. So it might be an issue with the crankcase ventilation and the air filter but that's guessing cause the intake side is the driver side.

Depending on how accurately you’re attempting to restore it, or if by restore you just mean “get it moving under it’s own power” the amount of time, money and work in front of you lies on a vast spectrum. It also depends how much rust (steel components) and dry rot (rubber and plastic components) it has.

If you’re barely trying to get it running safely-ish and barely comfortable-ish while still being rough looking with some help from outside shops, it’ll be between $4,000 and $20,000 (someone might disagree, and that’s fine) depending on what is there and what works still.

You could also scab it together without working gauges, shitty doors and windows, no hvac, rough motor and drivetrain, brakes that kinda work, no seals, etc. for 1 or 2k maybe.

If a system hasnt completely leaked to 0, you dont necessarily need to use a vac pump on it.  Go forth and learn, its AC not rocket science. 

And all other things being equal, there is a low limit and high limit switch on the system that will keep your ass generally covered against idiocy.

1mm2wrs,Help with transmission,"Hi everyone,

I’m having some issues with my 2015 Kia Soul transmission. I’ve noticed it has been jerking when shifting gears. I measured the ohms on the transmission solenoids, and they all showed 5 ohms, except for two that showed 10 ohms. 

I’ve seen conflicting information online: some sources say the normal range should be 12-17 ohms, while others mention that 5 ohms is acceptable. 

Can anyone provide insights on whether these values are normal and if the solenoids could be causing the jerking?

1mlyy2o,2015 Chevy Equinox Stalling Solution + Confused Regarding computer codes,"Hello: i have a 2015 Chevy Equinox my family has let me use since 2020. Since 2020 I have only done oil changes and no other preventative maintenance. I last had an oil change in January and went about 2000 miles since then - im at 56,000 miles. I checked the oil and it was really low about a month ago and I've been meaning to get an oil change. The check engine light came on two weeks ago and the car started stalling out here and there.   
I went by tire store and they said the codes were reading  p 0651 5j v reference 2 circuit- and p 0010 intake camshaft position actuator solenoid valve control circuit\*\*\*\*I did the youtube searches about what the codes mean and some online research but I am not knowledgeable.

I was asking friends what to do - one who is a diesel mechanic told me that I should start with an oil change and clear the codes and see what comes up. My old mechanic told me on the phone not to clear the codes \[I moved and am too far to see him now\].   

The first diagnostic I got the mechanic did not recommend the solenoid replacement; he said I needed a new battery and oil change;  when I mentioned the car was stalling out he then claimed I need new spark plugs \[heh claims he took it for a drive and his computer said misfiring\] and bg fuel/air inductions service.  

What I don't understand is the diagnostic that he gave it said on p001 'intake camshaft position system performance' it said since dtc clear: passed and failed; last test: passed; this ignition cycle: not run.

I went for a second diagnostic and they performed the work; they said I did not need a new battery; they cleaned the battery attachment part; They did replace or work on the solenoid valves;

So, my question is for my own understanding- does it make sense to clear the codes? What does the diagnostic say when it says last test: passed; this ignition cycle: not run. Does that mean I did not need the solenoid valves fixed?

Also, what is the issue with the spark plugs and new battery. Was the first estimate accurate regarding new battery and plugs and fuel induction service necessary or is that more of a preventative? I'm lost in this entire thing. The price was part of my decision -but also trust because the first mechanic I had never met and the second was a well known mechanic to a family member. this is a 2015 chevy equinox ls 2.4 l 4 cyl flex lea naturally aspirated.

Fixing the camshaft solenoid code will probably fix the intake camshaft system performance code.

I can sort of see the logic in an oil change since gunk can cause problems with the cam phasers, but the code you're seeing is for the control CIRCUIT.  That tells me the problem is electrical and the solenoid likely needs replacing.  Do you know if they were replaced?  If so, and the problem is solved, the code will go away on its own."

ASE goes through a lot of trouble to make sure the questions for their tests do not get out to make sure people can't memorize the questions and answers for their tests. The entire point of the ASE tests is to make sure you possess enough knowledge to be able to answer the questions. So here is a way to help you figure it out. If they ask a multiple choice question, and you are not sure of the correct answer then go back and read the question again and ask yourself is it possible for answer A, to be correct? If not then do this again but ask yourself could the answer for B be correct. Continue this process for all the answers, if it is obvious that 3 of the answers can't be correct, then you have the correct answer in the one that could be. So if you don't know the correct answer then figure out the incorrect answers and discard them, then pick from what's left. If you still are unsure, then skip it and come back at the end if you have time and try it again. A lot of the time, the answers to the test questions are given to you either a few questions before or after the one you are stuck on.

Your transmission is probably sealed and does not have a dipstick.  Very often people end up thinking they need a new transmission when it is just low on fluid.

1mly8ey,2011 S80 won’t turn off accessory when keyfob is ejected. Got a “new” ignition/housing from the junkyard but it needs to be reprogrammed. Any other options besides subscription to VIDA?,"Hi! My dad and I are working on my 2011 Volvo S80. I know nothing about vehicle mechanics so bear with me, but my dad’s is here with me if there’s any followup questions or clarification needed.  [Here’s a video example of what the unit looks like](https://youtu.be/0VTOssgvFNA?si=oSwmlKe-_6r9gt-S) 



For a while I’ve had a problem where the car will turn off the engine as expected when pressing the button, but won’t eject the keyfob — meaning the accessory doesn’t turn off. To turn the car off completely the fob must be pulled out by hand; I always had to stick my finger in there to unlatch “something”, but didn’t find out til pulling it all apart today that there’s an aluminum clip behind the sled that was catching on the side of the housing. 


Because it was grinding on that edge for a cool minute, I feel like the plastic housing is now worn and not able to keep the slider moving properly. We were gonna change out the motor and try it out but at the end of the day I think we need to resolder the chip onto the donor’s unit.


My question is this: can we just reprogram the unit itself somehow without needing to take apart the circuitry? If I’m googling correctly, I hear only the VIDA program at Volvo dealers can reprogram keyfobs.


Second, has anyone had this problem before, and what did you do to fix it? Is there anything we could be missing?

Im not trying to naysay you but as someone that rebuilds transmissions, which aren’t the same as differentials I’ll grant you but they’re just as complex if not more and require meticulousness, it’s probably a good chance this is what’s going to happen. 

You’re more than likely going to end up like how a lot of people who try to rebuild their own transmissions end up when they realize they can’t do it- they box up the transmission and then bring me a box of parts to put together their half finished headache they couldn’t get to work right. 

So, bear that in mind I guess. Just my own perspective.

Here's the situation: I have a 2015 Nissan Versa 1.6 S. I just moved to CA, and in order to register my car I have to get a smog inspection. I took my car in today for that, and conveniently my check engine light turned on just a few days ago. I ended up failing the smog inspection because my catalytic converter needs to be replaced. The code was P0420.

My car has 141659 miles on it, so I've already been wondering if she's reaching the end of her life. I'm planning to take my car in to another mechanic for a second opinion next week, but I'm curious on your guys thoughts. 

If I do truly end up needing a catalytic converter replacement, would it be more worth it for me to spend money on that or should I start thinking about getting a new car? I don't have much money, so neither option is great, but I don't want to spend all that money if my car isn't going to last me a few more years.  What do you think would be best?

Im not super familiar with VW suspension setups as I work mostly on chevys. But it does sound a little weird.

Control arms have a ball joint, bushing, and a smaller bushing that a bolt goes through to the frame. Sometimes, that third one has something called an eccentric bolt. Eccentic bolts allow you to adjust the castor/camber. It could be that that second smaller bushing is what is free wheeling.

If they didnt have to take that bolt out to replace the bushings it is possible that they wouldn't notice it.

It also depends on the type of lift and weight capacity the person is wanting to install. Something that’s rated for a higher capacity weight limit will need a thicker slab to put bolt anchors into.

I grabbed my mobile pack and jumped it (in the front, not on the battery itself in the trunk since I cannot even open the trunk). The car came on, all the lights went off except for the Red Triangle of death. The hybrid battery had a half charge on it. I replaced the 12volt 4 winters ago (Minnesota) so I wasn't freaking out about having to replace the 12v, however the red triangle is terrifying. I have never replaced the hybrid battery and it has 246,000 miles on it.

I turned it off and it wouldn't turn back on again. I last drove it on Thursday, my partner and I are both teachers so since it is summer we just drive it around town for a few miles a few times a week. It's an older car, it got me through college, and the thought of replacing it is making me sad. I just wanted to see if I did something wrong.

1mlrzg8,2013 Citroen C1 - Clutch slip and extreme oil burning.,"Hi all,
I know my fair bit of mechanics but just want to get some opinions on my gf’s car.

Background: Car hasn’t been serviced in over 18 months, in that time it has covered over 20,000 miles and oil consumption has increased to nearly 500ml a week!!!
Clutch bite point has always been high, it still bites but between 3-4,000 revs, the clutch begins to slip and burn, even with the foot off the accelerator, it still increases revs (apparently).

Hypothesis: Clutch cable has never been adjusted, could just need turning a few rotations to allow the clutch to bite lower and wear more of the pads.
Oil burning is likely down to the piston rings, car is now on 130,000 miles and blows blue like batman dropped a smoke bomb. Not joking. 

Other symptoms include struggling to shift gears, a mutual friend of mines says the gear linkages are seized and I don’t know enough nor am I qualified to even attempt to fix that. 

Any ideas/opinions?

These engines need frequent oil changes and good quality oil to stay healthy, ideally 6 monthly or every 6-8k miles. Each to their own though.

My first step would be to get an oil change and check the levels frequently. It might help but some damage might have been done. These engines can burn a little oil as they are high revving 3 cylinders but 500ml weekly is excessive.

For contrast mine uses around 150ml every 1500 miles.

Regarding the clutch start with adjustment as these are known to slip if not adjusted correctly. There are plenty of guides online. If still slipping after this it might be time for a new clutch."

Got a flat tire in the rear; front two tires were balding and two TPMS sensors had failed.  So I went to a small shop in town I hadn't been to before and bought 3 new tires (4th was newish; was a recent replacement from a previous flat), and asked them to replace the 4 TPMS sensors with new ones.

Shop owner says it's taken care of. I pay without verifying the job is complete (my mistake).  Tire pressure warning light is still on.  Shop owner tells me to drive it around and maybe it will go out (meanwhile, his shop hand is cursing that the scan tool is throwing error codes).  Doubtful.  Drive the car for the weekend with the light on all weekend.

Take the car back to the shop.  Shop owner tries to reprogram the new TPMS sensors himself; tries three different scan tools. Can read the pressure from the scan tool when pressed to the tire, but errors when plugged into the OBD2 port.

Shop owner tells me my ECU is bad.  Doubtful.

I call my usual Toyota shop that I probably should have just gone to in the first place. They tell me they've had customers' new TPMS fail to pair/train when the sensors weren't OEM.  I can imagine that the receiver is paired to a specific brand of transmitters.  Tell shop owner this advice. ""Of course they would recommend OEM parts"" he says derogitorily.  Claims scan tool works with 2012 Yaris (that said, I have the weird fleet model sedan, not the 3 or 5 door hatchback).  I never saw what branch TPMS he used, but they looked purple FWIW.

I asked if I order the OEM parts, would he install them and refund the cost of the previous TPMS sensors when returned to him. He said he would. I asked if he would refund the cost of the labor, too.  He got pissed and claimed ""I've done nothing wrong."" I told him it sucks to spend $250 on parts and labor only to not have the job _completed_.  I don't need $200 worth of TPMS sensors that don't work with my car.  I probably shouldn't have asked about refunding the labor.

Says on their site that they've been in business since 1990.  But the shop owner is acting suprised that any car needs specific TPMS sensors, or that my car in particular is the first he's seen like that.

I’m trying to figure out how much potential damage might’ve been done to the engine of a 2010 Elantra.

My elderly parents live a bit far from me, and my dad called today saying he saw a red temperature warning light followed by the check engine light.... I immediately knew the car was overheating, but unfortunately, my folks don’t know much about cars.

He mentioned that over the past 3 – 4 days, he’s been driving short distances and even saw smoke coming from under the hood a few times.... Despite that (yeah, I know… facepalm), he kept driving it and only today decided to actually check the dashboard and call me... 

When I got to their place, I found the coolant reservoir way below the minimum level- barely registering even 1/16"" with a dipstick  
  
He trusts the oil change place to top up fluids, but clearly they haven't been doing that 

I checked the oil level and it looked fine. 

First thing tomorrow, I’ll be topping off the coolant and checking for any leaks but obviously, the check engine light is still on ... hoping it goes off after I add coolant.

In your experience, does this sound like it could’ve caused serious damage?

1mlek1t,Possible Car Sale Scam – Oil in Coolant & Check Engine Light,"Hi everyone,
I was about to sell my car today, and something really strange happened that I’m worried might have been a scam attempt. I’d like to know if anyone here has seen or experienced something similar.

For context — I’m selling this car to help pay for my college tuition.

This morning, I drove the car for about 30 minutes — everything was fine. No check engine light, no odd noises, no performance issues.

Later, three men came to see the car (I think they were Hispanic). They seemed interested, and right away they started checking things:

One went under the hood.

One got inside the car.

One went underneath the car.


They were inspecting for a while, then we went for a short test drive. The drive itself felt totally normal — no lights, no problems.

When we got back, they wanted to check the engine again. That’s when things got weird:

Suddenly, there was oil visible in the coolant reservoir. It looked mixed in, like a blown head gasket symptom.

The check engine light had also come on when we restarted the car.

The engine was vibrating more than usual when idling (not violently shaking, but definitely rougher than normal).

When I checked the oil dipstick, the oil level was suddenly low — much lower than it had been earlier in the day.


Before all this, the car was running perfectly fine. This all happened within minutes of them checking the car and driving it.

They immediately started telling me the engine was damaged, that I’d need expensive repairs, and that I should sell it to them for a much lower price. My asking price was $4,700, but they insisted I should sell it to them for $2,000 because they can use it for parts, saying I’d “end up junking it” otherwise. I’ll admit — I was very close to taking the deal since I'm in serious financial need as a student who needs to pay his tuition. The only reason I didn’t was because a family member who was with me told me not to take their offer.

Now I’m worried they might have tampered with the car on purpose — maybe poured oil into the coolant, loosened or unplugged something to trigger the check engine light, or drained some oil to make the dipstick read low.

Has anyone here seen or heard of a scam like this? Could they have done something quick and easy under the hood to cause these symptoms without causing real permanent damage? What should I check before I take it to a mechanic?

Thanks for any advice. This situation really shook me up.",1,1754707553.0,6,AskMechanics,1754854475,2025-08-09 02:45:53,2025-08-10 19:34:35,"samdtho (Score: 5): This is not super uncommon.

It's huge, practical, and comfy, and I love the automatic transmission. The downside? It just broke down with a faulty electronic handbrake, and I've heard they can be unreliable.

* Space for 2 adults, 2 kids, and a mischievous dog 🐕
* Good reliability

Budget: Not a set cap, but we’re comfortable spending in the £15k–£25k range used, up to about 30-40k miles.

The shortlist so far:

* Toyota RAV4 Hybrid
* Honda CR-V Hybrid
* Hyundai Tucson Hybrid
* Kia Sportage Hybrid
* Ford Kuga Hybrid

What I’m after:

* How they hold up after 3–5 years
* Any “I wish I’d known before buying” moments
* Any reason to cross one off the list
* Any other options I should consider?

It also helps with VAG in particular Audi, where there were some naming quirks in the 90s like when the S4 (C4) got renamed the S6 (when the 100 was renamed the A6) and then rebooted the S4 name on the B5 platform a couple of years later. 

It’s a lot simpler, and in a typically German way. Or would you prefer a manufacturer to have a utter mess of naming like Aston where the DB line randomly skips numbers, or changes numbers despite actually being a facelift, and the Vantage went from the halo car name to entry level, and Virage went from halo to briefly mid range (as a relaunched DB9) before reverting back to the DB9 moniker with a GT suffix.

It has a VIN and appears to be in mint condition. We assumed it was a dealer unit that ended up at auction because the dealer couldn’t sell it or the dealership had gone out of business.

However, after trying to register it, we found out it’s actually a pre-production prototype – meaning it can’t be registered or legally driven on the road.

The auction listing made no mention of it being a prototype or non-road-legal vehicle. This was supposed to be a usable car, not a collector’s piece, so we're now stuck with something that can't be driven.

We've since been told these types of vehicles are sometimes sold to collectors or for off-road use only, but that’s not what my family member needs

# Has anyone been in a similar situation?

**Questions:**

* Is there any way to get a pre-production vehicle like this made road-legal in the UK? Whats the process?
* Could we challenge the sale or return it if the listing didn’t clearly disclose this? The auction refuses to take the vehicle back.
* Are there any specialist services or companies that can make these road-legal (if at all possible)?
* Worst case, is there a market for resale to collectors or for export?

Any advice or shared experiences would be hugely appreciated. Thanks!

1mlsmv8,On todays episode of how messed up is messed up...,"Hi all.

Some advice (or at least confirmation of what I know is 99% likely to happen) is needed.

My pride and joy Focus was rear-ended today, while my son was driving. We're both OK, he's a named driver on the policy, the other driver is insured, and was beside herself. I had to calm them down and tell them that it was all OK. Nobody was hurt, and that's what insurance is for.

The real PITA is that we've just bought another car, and I had to insure it, so my wife insured this car (I'm the registered keeper). We're now 4 years and 8 months after a similar bump where I was driving her car as a named driver on her insurance and someone rear ended me at the roundabout 400 yards from this one.

I'm sad about the car - it's been my faithful ride for 216k miles and 12 years **almost to the bloody day**, (12 years, 3 days) but absolutely gutted for him. He's not been driving long, and without this car, won't be able to drive for a while. This is our ""spare"" car which we use for taking stuff to the tip, letting him practice driving, taking to dodgy areas. I'm afraid this will dent his confidence. That's not why I'm here though (but if there are some words of comfort, I'll pass them on).

The first photo is showing the driver's side. I'm pretty sure the gap is there because the bumper is creased (photo 2) and pushing it forward, out of place. 3rd photo shows there's no gap at all between the boot lid and the passenger side rear wing, which makes me concerned that the boot, boot hinges or possibly even roof are bent out of shape.

The boot still opens and closes absolutely fine.

The 4th photo is the one that I'm straight up not enjoying the look of. Photo 5 shows the same bit on the other side of the car. This (to me) looks like the frame rail (or the unibody equivalent) is toast. It looks like it's fulfilled its dury of providing some crumple zone by crumpling and sacrificing itself.

My question is: Has this made the car unsafe/illegal to drive. If it's immediately unsafe, I'll claim on the other driver's insurance, and they can take it away, cancel our insurance (which started 2 days ago) and claim back the tax.

If it's not unsafe, is it acceptable to pull the bumper, pour boiling water over it to get the worse of the bends out and then just use it as a tip-run car?

As it is \*now\*, because the bumper is presenting a sharp edge, I'm presuming it would be an MOT failure, and I guess technically not safe to drive until I've stuck it down with duct tape.

If anyone has any thoughts, I'd greatly appreciate it.

Thanks",5,1754754440.0,8,CartalkUK,1754854475,2025-08-09 15:47:20,2025-08-10 19:34:35,"Ok_Air_9048 (Score: 5): I’m not an expert but a lot of the time it’s just the plastic damaged on the outside and then the crash bar on the inside it can look bad but that’s because it’s designed to crumple they just bolt on and off I can’t tell from your photos though but that’s my two pence.

Expert_Ant_2767 (Score: 2): Your photos are really confusing.  
Is the tailgate like that because it was itself crumpled or was the rear panel of the car crumpled?  
To have a idea of the extent of the damage on the rear panel, remove everything from the boot and have a look inside. You'll see the areas that were pushed in. Send us the photos.  
Basically, from the outside to the inside, you have the plastic bumper, the bumper reinforcement bar and then the rear panel. Since it looks like the rear panel was damaged, the proper repair would be to cut out partially or entirely the rear panel and solder a new piece or a new rear panel.  
The reinforcement bar and the bumper would then be replaced."
1mlsm1n,Why shouldn’t I buy this 2015 Jaguar XE?,"Hey all,

I’m 25 and currently driving a Honda Civic diesel. It’s been fine, but because I don’t drive long distances often, the DPF keeps getting blocked — which has been a pain.

I spotted this 2015 Jaguar XE for £6,500 (pic attached) and it’s got me tempted. I know Jags can have a reputation for reliability issues and higher running costs, but I wanted to ask:

Why shouldn’t I buy this?
	•	Are there common expensive faults I should be aware of?
	•	Are parts and servicing as bad as people say?
	•	Would it be a downgrade in practicality or reliability from my Civic?

If this isn’t a smart buy, I’d love to hear other suggestions. Ideally, I want something petrol (to avoid the DPF headache), fun to drive, a bit stylish, and not awful for insurance for someone in their mid-20s.

Thanks in advance for the reality check.

I’m in the market for my first car, and have viewed a few so far. I saw a VW up today from 2014, to everything  about the car was great in terms of its drive and performance. I took some pictures of the underside to check everything looked okay, but spotted a crack/corrosion on what I believe is the rear axel to the bottom right of the spring. 

I am not sure if this is a serious issue or not, but wanted to check incase it could potentially affect the structural integrity of the car/ cost me a fortune if I were to buy.

Ziemniok_UwU (Score: 2): A5s are perfectly good, providing the S Tronic (DSG) was serviced. Most of the panic over DSG gearboxes is due to the DQ200 dry clutch units which were only fitted to Transverse mounted engines, A4/A5 always had longitudinal mounted engines and got much more durable wet clutch DSGs.

The CLA is just an A Class with the same cheap build quality, you just pay for the badge. C class is more of a rival to the A5 otherwise the A5 wipes the floor with a CLA in terms of refinement and build quality. Petrol Mercs of that era are not amazing to be honest, Audi petrols are much better, providing they are B8.5 facelifts, the B8 models had problematic ones.

BMW 4 series could be a good rival to the A5 but their petrols only became good with the B series engines introduced around 2015 so may be out of budget.

1mlmyak,Disappointed with dealer paint repair job - am I too picky?,"I bought an approved used Skoda Enyaq from a Skoda dealer recently.

I like the sound and the age of the car is no problem for me. 

I’m expecting to run about 10-12k miles a year for the next four years maximum. I’ve had a look at the service history which is as follows:

Service One: 16k miles in Nov 2016 at a JCT in Bradford

Service Three: 33k miles in Dec 2019 Synter Cov

Service Six: 38k miles in Dec 2022 Synter Cov
Service Seven: 43k miles in April 2025 at Synter Cov

Ideally, I would just like some advice on whether the service history is up to scratch particularly for an N55 engine from 2014 for which I know there’s some debate on forums online about the engine. The running costs such as repairs, maintenance and real world fuel running costs. 

I’d be prepared to spend more on the car than running a regular Golf for instance since for me driving is a hobby as well as a way of getting around but I am still quite young so want to avoid a moneypit.

As for the N55 you'd expect oil leaks from the rocker cover and oil filter housing (and possibly sump) to begin around 100k miles. The direct injection system was refined after the N54 so they aren't so much of an issue. The water pump is hit and miss, it will need replacing, it's just a matter of when. Some are fine for 120k miles some go at 40k miles. Similarly at 100k miles the coolant hoses begin to crack. The stock charge pipe seems to also be a little weak, although this can easily be replaced with a metal one, and is an absolute must if you plan to remap the car. Walnut blasting to remove carbon buildup is also a good idea beyond 100k too. Gearbox service is a good idea too, BMW claim they're ""sealed for life"" but its worth changing the oil and mechatronic sleeves. Again, guess what mileage lol. Hopefully the picture is painted that 100k is when most of the major maintenance needs to be done.

Some of the more uncommon issues are oil starvation and bottom end wear, which is unique to the N55 and one of the places where it's weaker than the previous N54. Due to this you really want shorter oil service intervals, especially as the mileage rises.

At relatively low miles its hard to say if any permanent internal damage or excessive wear has occurred (more likely than not), but also oil deteriorates with time too. The N57 is one of the few if not only 6 cylinder BMWs that has some reports of timing chain issues. These issues are partly caused by the ridiculously long manufacturer recommended oil change intervals, which in this car, weren't even followed.

The number one rule for any used BMW is ALWAYS history and evidence of common issues being sorted, and the top of that list is always reasonable service intervals. The issue with BMWs at this mileage is that its not always high enough for the common issues to have started, but its hard to say when they will begin (aka potentially in your ownership). So the least you want is evidence of good oil services.

The only sort of person I can see getting away with this sort of car is someone who's looking to own it very short term or a mechanic who is happy to basically replace the timing chain and inspect the engine, then use it themselves, as obviously it is priced slightly lower than what it should be if it was actually maintained.

I have an early 2000's JDM car. For the past month or so, on startup I will get a squeal of the alternator belt followed by the battery light for a minute or so (sometimes the battery light would not come on, but mostly will). The squealing will then stop and the light goes away - and everything is fine.

At first, I suspected this was a slipping alternator belt so didn't think too much of it - I suspected it undercharging. It stopped doing it after a minute.

Turning off the car and restarting it solved it for a bit.

Alarm bells rand when one night when I realized both headlight bulbs blown - so this time I'd plugged a cigarette lighter charger with a voltage display.

To my suprise, during the squeals my alternator is overcharging to 18V and drops to normal when the squeals stop. There is also an error code stored on the roof ECU for over voltage.

I'll be changing the alternator today (I've never had experience of an overcharging alternator before).

1mlisv2,How long before notifying insurance,"Hey all, hope it is okay to put this question in this group. I was involved in a minor collision last night (not my fault) and my car has some minor damage to the paint work as well as the cover for the fog light/reflector being broken off. The other car owned has asked we don't don't through insurance which I'm fine with but I am slightly anxious that it's now the weekend so getting quotes from body shops is going to be much more difficult. I've had 2 responses already saying they'll look on monday. How strict are insurers about you having to notify in 24 hours? Just a little worried the quotes might be a lot more than we expect and we end up going through the insurance but don't want my claim to be void as its a few days later. Any else been in this position or able to steer me in the right direction?",1,1754721788.0,7,CartalkUK,1754854475,2025-08-09 06:43:08,2025-08-10 19:34:35,"lordblowfish (Score: 2): If you want your car fixed, just go through your insurance. They admitted fault, it’s clear who’s to blame, and you have no guarantee they’ll actually pay you. That’s what you pay premiums for. I’ve never told anyone not to go through insurance. I’ve only said I won’t claim myself, but they’re free to if it’s my fault. Call your insurer and get it sorted.

And OEM often tweaks the tyre slightly so it's not the same, for instance they might feature improved rolling resistance but worse grip.

1mlcg2k,Is it possible to negotiate for a used lexus es at main dealership? Any tips.,"My car is broken beyond repair and so I am looking for a new car. I have settled on used 3-4 year old Lexus ES300 takumi as I hear it is a very comfortable car to drive, has low cabin noise and is reliable. It is around £28k. Is it possible to negotiate the price of these cars when they are used at the lexus dealership? How much could one realistically take the price down by if it is? This is the most expensive car purchase I have ever made and any tips would be gratefully appreciated.

Generally main dealers are incredibly hesitant to budge on price and best thing you can negotiate on is added extras like warranties or service plans.

Also depends if you are a cash buyer or plan to finance. As a cash buyer you have very little leverage as dealers primarily make money of finance. If you are financing then you could ask if they do deposit contributions.
