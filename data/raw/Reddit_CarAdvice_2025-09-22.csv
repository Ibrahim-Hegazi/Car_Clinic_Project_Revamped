*Replace them all. Every one of them.* If you don't replace every one of them in one operation, at least one that you didn't replace will probably fail almost immediately.

The reasoning for this is simple: the absence of maintenance that led to one of them corroding through will have corroded every single one of them to varied degrees, and whichever one is next to fail will do so once the cooling system can pressurize again. So, you're better off to just bite the bullet once versus having to go back into it again and likely more deeply to get whatever plugs you missed the first time.

* **Brake Plus**: **$320** (or **$460** with “lifetime” pads) for **pads + rotor resurfacing**. They said there’s enough rotor left to machine and no need to replace.

 i have not had to do one of these.. if it has a pulley that bolts to the face of the hub.. you can use transfer punches to mark a piece of 5/16 to 3/8 plate..  so you can drill the mounting hole pattern.. drill a hole for the socket to fit thru the middle.. either have a steel welding shop or steel fab shop punch a 1/2"" square hole and a 3/4 square hole so you can hold the crank in position with a 1/2 or 3/4 breaker bar  while you tighten it with the socket on a long torque wrench or breaker bar.. 

 my friends M something BMW has a 750 foot pound Crank bolt torque spec. .

 you should have used a paint marker for a single stripe on one side of the bolt head and a mark on the hub so you know just how much you have applied in the torque to yield stage of tightening.. 

 most welding and steel fab shops cut up remaining sheet steel in 5x5"" to 10x10 inch squares for making brackets and flanges.. 

  the last thing i had made recently was a fan clutch wrench for astro vans.. its almost 3 feet long out of a square of 3/8 plate and a 2""strip of 3/8 plate welded on as a handle.. yes i made one with an oval punch hole to go over the pulley bolt.

1nn2fwl,Mini Cooper R56 N14 Engine Timing?,"Let me make it clear: I know my first mistake is owning an R series mini cooper lol we can skip that part—it’s fun and goofy. 

I had to replace the transmission due to some things going out at 175k. While in the process, since it’s a secondary vehicle, I chose to do some extra work: timing chain, master gasket kit, SMFW conversion kit, and some other less relevant things. Everything was going so well and had to fall apart somewhere lol. 

Well I got my order of operations wrong not realizing that the timing gears at the crank aren’t held in by a keyed shaft, rather just a pilot with a flange that the pulley bolts to. I rotated the motor over while setting the flywheel to torque all the bolts after installing a new rear main seal and then moved to the front of the motor only to realize my buddy and I pulled the pilot out to take the front main seal out and obviously that messed up my timing. 

There’s a machined hole on the back of the flywheel that allows you to lock the crank in position to time it and then a timing tool to lock the cams in position when you remove the chain. I found the hole through the bell housing but it doesn’t seem to align with TDC of cylinder 1, but it’s a flat plane motor, so I just put a long extension in the spark plug hole and rotated the crank. Well in 4 rotations, checking each time the extension hits TDC, I can’t find that hole. Does anyone happen to know if this motor times at a position that isn’t TDC of C1? 

The flywheel has an alignment dowel hole that allows it to only bolt up in one position so I don’t think I’m off there, but I suppose I could be and would have to pull the trans and clutch back off the motor.

Cleaning is part of repair.

Make sure the inboard joint isn't pulled out. Someone else mentioned the boot looks stretched. The issue is less the boot, and more that the tripod joints can be pulled apart. Usually they can be pushed back into place, and usually won't fit between the transmission and knuckle unless they are, but sometimes a joint being pulled apart ruins the axle.

Check the full range of movement in the axle by rotating the wheel, turning the knuckle all the way left and right, and putting weight on the suspension with a stand under the control arm. You should have free, smooth, uninterrupted movement.

If the issue is just that the rubber boot is pushed in on the crease, I would think that should correct itself after a few rotations. You could also try to push on the low spots and pull on the high spots to get it back into shape. If it doesn't get back to its normal shape and you drive on it the rubber might tear and loose grease again. I do expect that it would pop back into place before then, but I wouldn't really chance it.

If you pull it back out of the transmission, be careful of the rubber seal. They can be easy to tear. The splines are designed so that the axle shaft can push in easily even if not perfectly aligned, and the lock ring compresses and snaps into place at the same time without doing anything else. But if you're careless removing or installing you can destroy the seal and cause a transmission fluid leak. Keep an eye on it for a few days after it's all back together.

I’ve done the same and I’ve had success with minimal frustration only two ways. First one is replace the head. Can’t have an issue if the issue can be put in the recycle pile. Second is take the head off and bring it to a machine shop, they might be able to bore out the hole and install a threaded sleeve or other repair. I would call around first unless you have a good relationship with a specific machine shop. Otherwise it’s the hardest carbide bits you can find and hours or days of drilling. Torch might work, but aluminum melts a lot lower than steel and I’m not sure if aluminums thermal properties would allow it to shed heat faster than the steel/torch heats it up. I’ve never risked it, but that is an option. Even just getting the extractor red hot and cooling down as slow as possible could allow a normalization cycle which may soften it a little… but again surrounded by aluminum acting as a giant heat sink I don’t know if that would work."

1nmv9zv,Misfire 2004 silverado (4.3l v6),"To start, when I bought it, it had a cylinder 4 misfire, I checked the codes when buying it and it was the only code thrown so I  was like ok, a tune up and she's fine. So I threw seafoam down the tb, and tank, and did spark plugs and wires. Ran exactly the same, maybe like 5% better. Would do ok 0-60 but soon as I'd hit 60 it would lose all power, CEL would flash and I would have to slow down like 20 mph to gain power again. So I said screw it and drove it for a month and over that month I would consistently check the codes. It went from cyl 4, to just cyl 3, then a random misfire code, then back to just cyl 4 and stayed there a while. I got all the paperwork for work done on it when I bought it. It already had the distributor cap/rotor replaced 4 months prior and timed so I sorta ruled that out but I had the timing checked to make sure it was timed right when replaced and it was indeed in time. So then I got the cats removed and just pipe replacing it, as it sounded as if they were clogged, and turns out they was decently clogged

and that solved the issue with it getting to 60 mph and then bogging down and CEL flashing and codes for misfire NEVER came back BUT It still sounded like it has a pretty decent misfire on idle giving it gas to 1500-2k rpms and it still struggled to exceed 80mph but no loss of power at 60mph (what power it has anyways)  and CEL flashing. Then 1-2 months after that, it started randomly going through town going 5-20 mph, it will start just bogging out, pretty much sounding like its starved of fuel, soon as I lay into gas, its fine. So That then leaned me towards fuel filter / the spider injectors. So I replaced the spider injectors (whole system and injectors), and replaced the fuel filter. I want to say it ran better but nothing really changed.

So this is where I'm stuck now. Still Sounds like it has a pretty decent misfire on idle giving it gas to 1500-2k rpms, bogs out going 5-20 mph, and struggles to hit 80mph and if going uphill I'm lucky to cruise at 60-70 without having to absolutely floor it. Its almost like it has the same power now matter if throttle is barely pressed or to the floorboard. It won't bog out going 5-20 mph if I throw some fuel additive in it SOMETIMES but still struggles to gain speed / maintain it. The only CEL codes it has thrown since Misfire codes stopped appearing is for the cats/o2 sensors sense I had the cats deleted. I'm just stumped and would just like advice

I've replaced:

* Fuel Filter (twice)
* Spider System (injectors and all)
* Plugs/wires

1nmu23a,Trade in vs Repair considerations,"tl;dr - does it make financial sense to keep a structurally sound.. though aging..  truck vs trade in and buy something used? 

I have a 2012 RAM 1500 5.7L with 175k miles. I'm the only owner and have performed regular maintenance like oil, filters, belt, occasional sensor, etc. it's in good shape structurally. A roller bearing ate one of the cams about 5 years ago and I had that repaired by the dealer. No major issues other than that. It burns a little oil.. maybe needing a quart or so between changes. It does make a clicking noise from.. I think.. the transmission when, say, you're going 35 and you take your foot off the gas and coast. Noise goes away if you pop it in neutral. It's done this for years. 

It's not the primary family vehicle, I don't take it on long trips. I mostly haul trash, wood, hay, brush etc.. Otherwise I'm just running errands and such.. I work from home, too.. but if it were to go down, I'd need it back in relatively short order. A few weeks at most.. 

As it's getting up there in age/mileage I'm debating, should I trade it and get what little value is left in it and buy something used with lowish mileage? Or just keep this truck and expect to have a major repair in the next few years?  

I don't really care about fancy and new, just moderate dependability. I lean towards keeping it and just expecting to replace something major but I'm not sure if that's a solid strategy. A big part of my motivation is that I'm trying to get my house and other debt paid off.. I don't want to borrow more if I don't have to and I could afford a 10k repair out of pocket (though it would sting). But if keeping and repairing is just a monumental boneheaded move then I'd like to know.

Car: 2014 Suzuki S-Cross 1.6 diesel, with 90k miles.

I had an inspection/health check done recently — apart from the top mount and shock absorber (which they said had “lots of play”), nothing else was flagged. I’ve since had the top mount and shock replaced, but the creaking noise is still there.

Symptoms:

Every time I move off from a stop, there’s a creak from the front end.

On full right lock, there’s a knock followed by a rubbing/scraping sound.

The noises are consistent whether I’m on flat ground or moving slowly in town.


Other background:

Before the shock I got told it's likely the track rod end. so I got them replaced.

There was a hub nut issue a few weeks after I bought the car (RAC sorted it at the roadside).

Tyres, brakes etc. seem fine and the car otherwise drives OK.

For example, if you have low profile tires, there is a greater chance you damaged one or more rims. If you've got taller tires or drive a normal truck, the chances of damaging anything are a lot lower. 

The good news is if there was any serious damage, you would have noticed it right away. If you haven't noticed a change in the way it drives and no warning lights came on, then its likely that any damage is fairly minor. 

A lot of chain shops offer pretty cheap (like $20-$40) basic visual inspections. It would be worthwhile to have one of those done to at least get it up on a lift and checked for anything that you may need to keep an eye on and give you some peace of mind.

1nmp7j2,The Lexus HS: how Lexus’ attempt to build a luxury Prius led to the worst-selling Lexus in history.,"The Lexus HS was Lexus’ attempt to capitalize on rich American bougie folk buying Priuses to make themselves appear green. There was a market for a luxury efficient hybrid, and Toyota-Lexus wanted to capitalize on it.

So how did they do it?

They took the hybrid powertrain from 2007’s XV40 Camry, and slapped it onto a 2009 T270 Avensis body from Toyota’s European lineup. The end result was a car that was bigger than a Prius, had less space, and only did \~38 mpg instead of the \~50 the Prius would do.

But hey. It was slightly faster (188 hp, vs. the XW30 Prius’ 134). Which completely defeats the purpose of an efficient hybrid, but whatever. Maybe that’s why sales were so horrific that the HS was pulled from the US market after just two model years, 2010-2012. It was replaced in the lineup with the Lexus CT, which genuinely *was* just a Prius in a rather sexy suit, that saw very good sales all around until Americans decided to stop buying passenger cars.

Today though, the HS is extremely cheap on the used market, and the Camry powertrain means it’s both very reliable and very cheap to service. A solid steal of a deal if you find one used and want a semi-luxury commuter car.",68,1758453045.0,22,CarTalk,1758569625,2025-09-21 11:10:45,2025-09-22 19:33:45,"Eclipsed830 (Score: 47): CT200 is the actual Prius.

The clutch and throttle are to all intents and purposes unrelated, so having an issue with both of them in this way, which is now resolved, just sounds like a floor mat issue to me.

other things which might cause the sudden over-revving would almost certainly have triggered a warning light, or a code which you could check for.  in the absence of these I'd just make sure the mat isn't in the way and be mindful for a bit, rather than take it to a mechanic who'll not be able to find anything

1nmgdhr,"So, where do you guys stand on how a can should be positioned while recharging an ac system?","I ask because research on Google, reddit, etc, says to keep the can sitting upright. On the other hand, almost all videos I've watched of the process being done show people either turning the can sideways, shaking the can, or both. It's said that it's supposed to be introduced to the system as gas/vapor, but when I sat the can upright, it seemed like nothing was going on. Does it take longer for the refrigerant to transfer through the lines in gas form or something? To be honest, I lost patience and started turning the cans and shaking a little bit. Turns out I have a new leak from one of my service valves, high side. Just replaced it and am about to give it another try. Pulling a vacuum for about an hour first. 

Initially, after recharging yesterday, or maybe yesterday, the compressor kicked on, and the vents blew cold for about 15 minutes, then went back warm. I thought it might be either because I tilted the refrigerant can, I overcharged it, or because of adding too much oil. The manufacturer instructions weren't too clear on the pre-filled amount thatcamem in the new compressor. The amount Amazon said it came with didn't help. Then I poured it out to measur,  and less than an ounce came out. Either way, people here on reddit assured me it's not likely the oil

Fast forward to when I thought I might have overcharged it. After it blew cold for 15 minutes and stopped, I happened to discover the high side ball valve service port had a pierce in the middle rubber part and I heard it hissing when I removed the high manifold gauge hose from it. I replaced it today and would appreciate some advice on how the can should be positioned while recharging. 

So, sitting upright the whole time, no matter what? Laying on its side? Tilting back and forth? Upside down? A mixture of two or more of the four? Hope I get it right and over with. I'll be proud, but I am sick of how long it's taking due to all the little issues I ran into. Either way, I think I did pretty well 😌

This was three and a half weeks ago. They fixed the leak, but then broke the oil pan putting it back together.

It's safe to say that it's unlikely anyone else responding to this thread has actually done any of the repairs that have been attempted with your Expedition. Having the oil pan break during a major job reassembly is the result of a very simple oversight, a trap that could happen to anyone not highly experienced with this work. Having to take this back apart and make that right when it happens is exactly what a shop and a technician is supposed to do when they suddenly got to learn another lesson the hard way.

Comes by a few days later to get started and at this time I was confident for some odd reason, he took apart everything and got to work, took the old timing chain out and did the change etc. one thing I noticed was he was really rough with how he was taking things apart in that engine area, so he replaced the old timing chains and goes to start it up (he disassembled and reassembled 3 different times mind you) for this first time, the engine didn’t even turn over. He leaves and comes back the next day, he goes back in and disassembles it, does something else in there and now it’s round two, he starts it, and it’s running real rough, and jumping around it sounded like, then a few seconds later oil starts squirting out of engine area all on the interior of my hood and spraysss alllll over the engine, a few seconds after that I’m trying to tell him stuff is spraying and then I hear a loud CLANK, and oil starts pouring out on my garage floor? And he says “oh call so and so and ask them how much for an engine, it’ll be way easier than the timing chain and quicker to just replace the engine” he says that after kind of mumbling about the engine being shot. He calls a buddy and he comes to look at it from the underneath of the car and the buddy says “well I don’t see any holes or anything so the engine should be good, there should be a problem with the engine it’s still good” so me being the non mechanically inclined person I am, I just go with it. He proceeds to stay at my house all day(going into the third day sleeps in my car in my garage because he didn’t have a vehicle) and I didn’t mind, I wake up and go out there and nothings changed. But I’m still level headed, even up to this point I still am. He leaves that morning says he has to handle some stuff and that the car just needs oil not and something needs loosened. so day three he leaves and comes back later in the afternoon to get started on round 3. He has No charged phone, so he asks me to use my phone for a YouTube video, falls asleep during the video so I just let the dude sleep, 3 hours go by and I go back out and wake em up because I assumed he still wanted to be paid up to this point even tho I bought the part and he hasn’t really done anything, at the point I’m starting to lose a lot of hope. Round three of him taking it apart and putting it back together results in the car not even running and stalling out, after that he said he didn’t feel good and said he’s gotta get some rest, at this point I’m pretty frustrated as I have a wife and kid, and this is the only car I have. After the guy leaves, he texts me on September18th and says “I can’t stop feeling like I let you down, I know I can fix it, I just don’t know why it’s taking this long” mind you, when he left, he didn’t put anything back together, he actually started taking more things apart. (I have a picture if they let me post it in comments) on September 18th, I proceeded to tell him it’s alright, and ask if he’ll be stopping by in the morning to finish the job, no response. September 19th I asked if he could at least come and put the parts that he took apart back together in my engine area because 9/10 I’m going to have to pay someone to do that just to pay someone again to figure out what’s going on, and once again no response. September 20th comes and he sends his buddy that I was previously talking about, to my house ASKING FOR 300 bucks for the job????? And I still haven’t heard anything back from the mechanic guy? I shew him off and now I’m really frustrated, there’s nothing I can really do because I’m not a mechanic, I’m financing this vehicle from a near by, buy here pay here, and there was a warranty on the engine, and now the entire warranty is voided because not only did he mess with the engine im pretty sure there’s gotta be some broken components. And I don’t make a lot of money as of right now (job hunting for a new higher paying job as we speak) so I’m at a huge loss with my part time job paying me less than 300 a week, and probably going to have to pay someone 1. To put the shit back together, 2. To diagnose the problem 3. A tow truck to get it to a shop, 4. Obviously the repairs.

1nmit9l,My headlights are too dim in my 2006 Subaru forester,"
Hi everyone. I have a 2006 Subaru forester that I’ve owned for about a year. I live in alaska and way in the middle of nowhere where there are no streetlights. I just recently replaced my bulbs like maybe a month ago. So 

1. I have had to change my headlight bulbs like at least three times since I bought the car

2. My headlights have gotten extremely dim to the point where I’m refusing to drive at night because I fear hitting a moose and dying I feel like I can’t see much at all, even with my brights on 

3. They are too dim at their brightest, but they also dim every time I press the brake and also just randomly for a couple seconds 

I’ve read some things online, I don’t know anything about cars 

I read that it could be the alternator or an electrical issue and something about a brake light switch? Idk 

I take my car to the mechanic regularly and they always tell me everything is fine and the car is great. Havent asked about the headlights yet 

I’m pretty sure the bulbs in the picture are the ones I bought but I just take the O’Reilly employees recommendation and then have my boyfriend replace them for me 

I replaced both at the same time last time I changed them 

The last time they were replaced, my boyfriend took the old ones out at the tips were broken off? Idk what that means 

Any suggestions  about what I should do or what the issue could be?

Do you ever need to jump start it or does it start fine always? If it was the alternator you’d likely have to jump start it, or it would struggle to start often.

Make sure to avoid touching the glass with fingers when installing the bulbs. If you do, clean the glass with alcohol or carb cleaner or bake clean. 

Dimming when letting off throttle: the alternator could be weak. Ask your mechanic to test/measure its output.

Also, is the surface of the headlights fogged up? At that age, I would be surprised if they weren’t. If you and your boyfriend can handle some DIY and have a power drill, the 3M kit works well but follow up the cleaning with a good coat of clear spray paint (1K).  Or replace the assemblies with new aftermarket ones from Ebay (the bumper cover will need to removed to replace them).

Find YouTube videos for using the 3M kit, spraying clear on headlights (taping and covering your paint will be needed) and for replacing headlights on a Forrester.

1nmgfaq,"So, where do you guys stand on how a can should be positioned while recharging an ac system?","I ask because research on Google, reddit, etc, says to keep the can sitting upright. On the other hand, almost all videos I've watched of the process being done show people either turning the can sideways, shaking the can, or both. It's said that it's supposed to be introduced to the system as gas/vapor, but when I sat the can upright, it seemed like nothing was going on. Does it take longer for the refrigerant to transfer through the lines in gas form or something? To be honest, I lost patience and started turning the cans and shaking a little bit. Turns out I have a new leak from one of my service valves, high side. Just replaced it and am about to give it another try. Pulling a vacuum for about an hour first. 

Initially, after recharging yesterday, or maybe yesterday, the compressor kicked on, and the vents blew cold for about 15 minutes, then went back warm. I thought it might be either because I tilted the refrigerant can, I overcharged it, or because of adding too much oil. The manufacturer instructions weren't too clear on the pre-filled amount thatcamem in the new compressor. The amount Amazon said it came with didn't help. Then I poured it out to measur,  and less than an ounce came out. Either way, people here on reddit assured me it's not likely the oil

Fast forward to when I thought I might have overcharged it. After it blew cold for 15 minutes and stopped, I happened to discover the high side ball valve service port had a pierce in the middle rubber part and I heard it hissing when I removed the high manifold gauge hose from it. I replaced it today and would appreciate some advice on how the can should be positioned while recharging. 

So, sitting upright the whole time, no matter what? Laying on its side? Tilting back and forth? Upside down? A mixture of two or more of the four? Hope I get it right and over with. I'll be proud, but I am sick of how long it's taking due to all the little issues I ran into. Either way, I think I did pretty well 😌

When it is upside down, it releases liquid. If you put enough liquid into the low side, it does not have time to expand into gas before it gets to the compressor. Your compressor is basically a tiny piston engine without combustion. Just like a regular engine, if you get enough liquid in it, it can hydrolock.  This is very bad and will destroy the compressor. If you don't have a full gage set to see what the high and low sides are doing, and the understanding of how an ac system works, you really shouldn't be touching ac. It's not hard to get it to work, but it's also not hard to do serious damage to your system. That damage may be immediate or not noticeable at all until it finally kills it way down the road.

• Direct wired tool → ECU works fine:
27 01/02 (seed/key) → 10 02 (prog session) → 2E … (writes) → then tool sends 34 (RequestDownload). ECU replies 74 and programming starts.

• Over a TCP bridge (two ISO-TP STACKS on 2 machines as proxies to mitigate the latency) the logs are byte-for-byte identical up to the 2E … writes. After that, the tool never sends 34. Instead only 22 (read) and 3E (tester present) appear.


So the ECU is ready, all security passed, but the tool itself never issues the download request unless it’s directly wired. I’ve verified the data: up to 2E both paths match byte for byte. The missing piece is why the tool refuses to send 34 when routed over TCP!

Searching a bit it seems I can use jbweld to hold the bumper in place, but the issue is that I can’t even get it dry fitted with all my strength. Perhaps it’s because the front grill has popped off a bit and needs to be somehow tucked back in before it will want to get seated back properly?

 he looked at the front end of the rear sections of the parking brake cables. one did not retract fully into the casing leaving a little shiny area of the cable core sticking out.

 now.. deflect the self adjuster cable to verify the star wheel rotates just a tooth or two..  if it does not work.. is the cable the proper length.. is the eyelet on the upper end of the cable pulled tight against the anchor stud..  while doing this. also verify that by flexing the self adjuster cable that the adjuster is actually opening not closing. there are left and right hand threaded adjusters.."

Does it behave the same way if you just rev the engine to 2-3,000 RPM in Park & hold it there for a minute?


The only thing I can think of is that airflow over the external intake (usually in the small grill at the base of the windshield, passenger side) is forcing its way in, possibly forcing the recirculate door closed so that your system is trying to cool a bunch of hot, outside air, which it can't.


You can try covering the passenger side of that little grill with masking tape to see if it stops getting warmer with speed, and if so, you'll need to inspect the recirculate door & actuator, which you can usually access by removing the blower motor.


If blocking that external intake doesn't change anything, then there's pretty good chance something wasn't installed correctly, such as a loose belt on the compressor, or too much refrigerant that trips the high pressure switch when RPMs go up.

1nmn7vy,Help me identify this coolant hose on my 2015 BMW 435i (N55),"I will try to be as succinct as possible, but I have a tendency to make my posts quite long. 

Yesterday, I picked up my car from my mechanic. I have had an oil leak and a coolant leak that have been persistent and a little annoying for months. I got around to taking it in last week to get fixed and my mechanic replaced the Engine Oil Thermostat for the oil leak and a coolant flange that leads into the engine for the coolant leak (unsure which flange if there are multiple). 

Well after 20 miles of driving, I received a notification on my IDrive system that my coolant was low and I checked it out. I lost a whole expansion tank worth of coolant and this hose (see pictured - Its the rubber hose connected with a worm gear clamp) was gushing coolant after I turned the car off. There is a massive gash at the end of the hose near where the worm gear clamp is. I have the following questions if you could be so kind to help someone who isn't very mechanically literate. Before I ask the questions, just wanted to state the following if it happens to help you identify the hose: Again, I am not super knowledgeable and its tough to see in a compact engine compartment in the dark. But this hose is relatively thick in diameter and seems to run underneath the intake and might connect to something that looks like a coolant thermostat near/under the expansion tank. Again, this is just what it looks like, I could be wrong. 

  
1. What is this hose called? I need to ensure my mechanic has it in stock when I drop the car off so I would like to describe exactly what hose it is when I call him Monday morning. I need my car all of next week so I will need to wait while he replaces it.  
2. Given that he replaced the Oil thermostat and a coolant flange. How likely is it that this leaking hose was touched during this last repair? I'm not here to assign blame, but I highly doubt that this car was gushing coolant from such an obvious spot and I didn't notice it before. I mainly want to know so that I am informed when it comes time for me to ask/expect him to waive or reduce some of the labor charge associated with replacing this hose.

I am honestly at a loss. Most modern cars seem to have a slew of problems.

Volkswagen engines used to be great, now they are more less okay. Chinese brands are complete strangers (been introduced not so long ago in the market in my country), and honestly I wouldn't gamble on a Chinese  vehicle.

Changed the power steering pump and rack and pinion. Figured I might as well put in new lines as well. So all brand new parts. I didn’t test fit before installing which was def a mistake. 

I started with the pressure line, which is the lower port on the rack and pinion (checked the repair manual), but I just couldn’t line up the screw and it was very very difficult to get screw in. So finally got it to the point in the picture that’s as hand tight as it will get by bare hands, then used crow foot and hand tightened again. There’s still thread to go so I’m not sure I’m sufficiently sealed (and yes it’s got new o rings on it!) so first is that line ok? 

Then tried to the return hose and that too was impossible to screw in properly. Ended up checking to make sure I wasn’t cross threading.  Grabbed a magnet and ran it inside the port for the rack and pinion and def pulled out some tiny scraps of metal. But then I was able to screw the return line pretty nicely, but still not all the way to the bottom of the threads. It’s pretty darn tight just by hand screwing with the crows foot- I don’t want to over tighten, so didn’t use a ton of force. I believe manual called for torque to 31 ft lbs or 31 NM (whichever of those is the smaller force). 

Will link a YouTube video too. Pleaseeee let me know if I need a new rack and pinion or new lines just because of the potentially bad threads!

The undercarriage of the car was wet not sure with what, id guess coolant. Engine bay i couldn't see any visible leaks, I wasn't able to check coolant level as i had to take the cap off. 

The car has been smoking on acceleration recently after it idles it appears as a whitish blue smoke and just a shot of smoke then its done. (no oil consumption in last 2k kms) have to fill up coolant tank weekly or at least check it.

1nmgfg7,"So, where do you guys stand on how a can should be positioned while recharging an ac system?","I ask because research on Google, reddit, etc, says to keep the can sitting upright. On the other hand, almost all videos I've watched of the process being done show people either turning the can sideways, shaking the can, or both. It's said that it's supposed to be introduced to the system as gas/vapor, but when I sat the can upright, it seemed like nothing was going on. Does it take longer for the refrigerant to transfer through the lines in gas form or something? To be honest, I lost patience and started turning the cans and shaking a little bit. Turns out I have a new leak from one of my service valves, high side. Just replaced it and am about to give it another try. Pulling a vacuum for about an hour first. 

Initially, after recharging yesterday, or maybe yesterday, the compressor kicked on, and the vents blew cold for about 15 minutes, then went back warm. I thought it might be either because I tilted the refrigerant can, I overcharged it, or because of adding too much oil. The manufacturer instructions weren't too clear on the pre-filled amount thatcamem in the new compressor. The amount Amazon said it came with didn't help. Then I poured it out to measur,  and less than an ounce came out. Either way, people here on reddit assured me it's not likely the oil

Fast forward to when I thought I might have overcharged it. After it blew cold for 15 minutes and stopped, I happened to discover the high side ball valve service port had a pierce in the middle rubber part and I heard it hissing when I removed the high manifold gauge hose from it. I replaced it today and would appreciate some advice on how the can should be positioned while recharging. 

So, sitting upright the whole time, no matter what? Laying on its side? Tilting back and forth? Upside down? A mixture of two or more of the four? Hope I get it right and over with. I'll be proud, but I am sick of how long it's taking due to all the little issues I ran into. Either way, I think I did pretty well 😌

1nmdota,Is my AC compressor shot?,"I drive a 2018 Subaru WRX base model. I noticed this clicking noise about 3 days ago and realized it only happens when the AC is turned on. There’s nothing visually wrong in the engine compartment and the serpentine belt doesn’t seem to be slipping. The AC started blowing warmer air around the same time, although it’s still colder than the ambient temperature. One additional problem that I’ve been having is some bogging down/loss of power when accelerating from a stop. The car seems to lose power for about 1 second before picking up again. It feels pretty lurchy and is definitely abnormal. This seemed to start at the same time as the AC problems. Whether the AC is turned on or not doesn’t seem to affect the problems with acceleration. I’ve had no check engine lights or other indications from the ECU that something is wrong. 

I’m wondering a couple things here:

1. Is it likely that the AC compressor is completely shot, or is it possible that it only needs to be repaired/rebuilt (eg. new clutch or bearing)?

2. Is it possible that my problems with engine power are related to the AC issue? They both started at the same time, and I’m wondering if the compressor is simply putting abnormally high strain on the engine. I’ve also seen some mention online of the ECU interpreting AC problems as engine knocking, but I figure this would have thrown a code. 


The only other issue I noticed recently was a significant amount of corrosion on the battery terminals. The battery is about 2 years old and I haven’t had this problem before. I cleaned all of the corrosion off and installed new terminals with no change in the acceleration issues.

Freekmagnet (Score: 1): Possibly wrist pin noise.    If you  disable combustion in each cylinder one at a time (by disconnecting an injector plug or plug wire while the noise is occurring) and the noise doubles in frequency then that cylinder has a piston/ wrist pin clearance issue. The noise from a piston will double when combustion in the cylinder is killed because you are removing the downward force on the piston allowing it to knock in both directions instead of only on the unloaded upstroke.   The noise stops because the pistons get very hot pretty quickly, changing clearances.

Generally that will not cause any reliability problems, providing the noise goes away after running a few seconds.

Another possibility is (if this engine has VCT, I don't recall) is a bad cam phaser that is not locking at base position.  If you have ever heard a F150 Ford with a bad phaser it sounds like a rattling/ knocking noise on cold starts usually, until they get really worn and start making noises all the time at idle.     Using a mechanics stethoscope or a long screwdriver held to your ear you may be able to isolate the noise down to a cylinder (by listening to the sides of the block)  or to the front timing cover area to get a better idea of the source.

Also, this may be a remote possibility- make sure it is not coming from the serpentine belt tensioner.    Generally noises like that from a tensioner with a weak spring don't go away with a change in temoerature but it's still a possibility.   Pull the belt off and see if the noise is still there the next morning when started cold."

1nn30yz,"PCP contract ending, damage to vehicle","So my Arnold Clark PCP finance is coming to an end in a few months. I've hated the car and don't intend on keeping it. I also don't really want another car on finance with Arnold Clark because their prices are obscene. Ideally, I'd simply return it and go elsewhere for my next car. 

I have its final MOT booked in ready and I fear it's gonna cost me quite a lot at MOT because a lots been going wrong in it lately. 

However, what I'm the most concerned about is that there's a bit of bodywork damage on the car. Lived in a rough area and got my car a little bit bashed up. A few small dents around the bodywork and a few small scrapes that I've done my best to tidy up. Nothing crazy, and not obvious unless you're taking a good look at the car, but once you're really looking you notice the damage. 

Is this likely to bite me in the ass when I return the car? Are they likely to financially penalize me for this minor damage? Should I just take it to the body shop and pay out my own pocket to fix the issues before I take it back (money is crazy tight right now though). Any advice or experience appreciated!

If you are changing even to another brand from a different outlet let the new dealer appraise the car, it may even in a damaged state be worth more than the final payment / residual value on your PCP agreement with Arnold Clarke (or whoever they used to finance it). 

Handing back a car on PCP is rarely the most financially sensible route, in theory you'll have built some equity to use against your next PCP. The damage (or over mileage) will obviously impact on that to some extent.

Just go into this knowing other big items could still crop up at this age. If the mileage is around or over 100k, the gearbox will likely need a full service to keep it healthy. Front suspension bushes, ball joints and lower arms are also a common wear point on these, as the XF tends to eat them. 

On top of that, I’m assuming it’s a Euro 5 diesel - if so this limits its long-term market appeal as ULEZ/CAZ zones expand.

Budget is around £4k, ideally around 10-12 years old car. I know at this price point I’m looking at high mileage cars, which I guess should fine since they’re diesels – but I’d like to know what mileage is *too much* for some of these engines, and what major work I should check were done before buying.

Here are my current picks from dealers with more or less adequate reputation and 4.5 review ratings, all of them offer 3 month warranty:

* **2013 Kia Ceed 1.6 CRDi 2 Auto Euro 5** – £3,500 – 121k miles
   * Will have some service history (dealer sending it over Monday) + serviced before sale.

I presume the sub won't like it, but I have some French cars saved. I tried to target only those equiped with diesel HDI engines and EAT gearboxes though as they seem more sensible choice. 

* **2016 Peugeot 308 SW 1.6 BlueHDi EAT Euro 6** – £4,250 – 112k miles 
   * Dealer says it only needs an oil pressure switch and good to go. No service history (trying to clarify why – could be lost). MOT history is spotless though, only ever had a wiper advisory.
* **2014 Citroen DS4 2.0 HDi DStyle Auto Euro 5** – £3,795 – 97k miles
   * Stamped service book and pre-sale service.

Private picks:

* **2013 Volvo V60 D5 Geartronic** – £3,700 – 124k miles
   * Stamped service book and some invoices available. 
* **2013 Honda CR-V 2.2 i-DTEC Auto** – £3,850 – 140k miles
   * Seller says he is a mechanic. He said the car did not start, but he replaced the fuel pump, 4 injectors, fuel rail, and got it running again. Stamped service book available.

So, my questions for you:

* Which of these would you **avoid at all costs** and why?
* What major jobs/services should I check have been done that are kinda specific to these models (apart from timing belt, gearbox fluid, DPF, etc.)?
* For the Peugeot with no service history – worth the risk if everything drives fine + clean MOT?
* Any other good estate/SUVs I should be looking at around this price point?

1nmymus,What should I do car wise,"I'm hoping this is allowed in this subreddit!

I am trying to make a decision on what I should do about my car situation. Keep my current PCP, get a new car, or share a car. I currently walk to work so I have no travel and I also work with my partner, so he walks too

The reason for getting a new car is me and my partner are going to start looking to buy a new house mid next year and kids will naturally follow, my Toyota can't fit a car seat in it (I've tried, its so cramped) and the boot is so small that it will definitely not fit a pram, it can just about fit a weekly shop. & The car will most likely start to cost me money (new tyres, etc). I also have nephews and it's just so small for kids!

I currently pay £141 for a Toyota Aygo 2020 plate, I have 20 payments left. It's due an MOT next month and will most likely need two tires, it was an advisory on last year's service. It's a very small car but was perfect for my first car. It's not suitable for my future and it's losing value, at the moment there's £7,899 left but it's valued at £6500 dealer or £7500 private. So I am worried the longer I leave it the more negative equity it will have and it will start to become a liability. I have no desire to pay the ballon payment to keep it

I asked about getting a car, we went through the deals with Toyota, it worked out cheaper per month to get a brand new Yaris Design than it did to get a second hand deals. The total being £248pm. £2,000 deposit, I have paid £350 already. I walked out with a brand new car.. I don't know how they do it... I only went in to ask.. 😅 I was after a CHR but they were over £300pm used. I am still worried a Yaris won't be big enough for a car seat.. although the boot was big enough for a pram. But they Toyota guy said in a couple of years I could switch it for another car

My partner suggested I do a voluntary termination of my current car and share his car and back out of the new PCP. This will save £141 a month, plus whatever the upkeep may be

I use my car maybe once a week but sometimes I can go a couple of weeks without using it depending on how busy I am with work and if people come to see me not the other way round. I use it mainly to drive to my sisters (they both live 15-20 mins away). My partner works a lot and usually uses his car on our day off, we go out for breakfast etc. Or after his shifts when he sees his dad/mum, I don't drive in the dark. So it will doubtful it will clash when it comes to using the car. Then when we get a house, we'll either be financially in the position to buy a car outright or get another PCP but a more suitable family car (e.g. ford puma- I've sort of fallen in love with this car when googling small family cars😅) and that will be the car that we will likely pay off and keep. The money saved from sharing will either go towards paying outright or a bigger deposit for the car. & My partner keeps his car (it's brought) for work travel. Overall, it will most likely be buying a car outright in the future

1nmyep2,Should I scrap my 2014 Vauxhall Insignia,"So essentially, I’ve had this car and picked it up for £1500 which is cheap by used car standards.
But about 4-5 months ago I got a engine light :(

Turns out there’s an air leak somewhere. When I took it to the mechanics they had said my air intake manifold has a big crack on it which is causing the computer in the car to shut off the turbo.

Thing is my turbo works for a bit then turns off when I really need it lol (slip road, overtake etc). I know the my strut mounts need doing and my MOT is in January. I had also needed to fix a coolant leak but I had used a coolant leak solution to sort it out. 

Long story short since I have my MOT in January that might give me enough time to save up as best I can. Do I scrap or sell?

I’ve spent at least 1500-2000 on the car since I’ve had it (about 1 1/2 years) which is not great at all.

I estimate the mot to cost me minimum 500 in repairs, both strut mounts and bushes etc. And to fix the manifold since it’s a 2.0 insignia has about 600-700 labour just to change it🤦🏽‍♂️

Check the suspension, look for any obvious damage, and listen to it when you go over another bump. If you hear any new noises, or if it feels different from usual, take the car to get checked by a professional. Check the alignment - does the car go straight when the steering wheel is straight? If you hold it with a light touch on a straight, flat road, does the steering wheel try to go to one side or the other?

I’d agree with the other commenter who said that the jump from 4k to 7k mileage is because you are probably in a lower bell curve of “declared miles vs number of crashes” type situation. 

I drive 24,000 miles per year though my premium isn’t double price versus 12,000 because it’s only one factor out of literally thousands. It’s all about each individual insurers appetite to these different factors that makes an overall price.

Also be mindful that the aggregators such as CompareTheMarket and GoCompare are owned by insurance companies who also sell their own policies under different brands on their comparison sites so will routinely promote theirs or discount versus other third party brands.

For having two claims in 2023, I think you’re getting a good rate, but it depends on the car, limits of cover, legal expenses/courtesy car add ons too. 

Also in terms of age, you likely won’t see another significant difference until 45/50+ but monetary inflation will have removed any real saving you’d see by then anyway ha.

PCPs are specifically designed to encourage perpetual car replacement every 3 to 5 years just because you get conditioned to accept the payments as part of life and it always seems a more tempting option to do this than pay off the balloon. You never get to own the car really. And with the era of low interest rates being over there isn't much value in them now.

PequodarrivedattheLZ (Score: 2): PCP only really is worth it for new or slightly used cars (although the scheme itself is part of the enshitification of cars)

You can try something like hire purchase, where after 2-5 years you own the car outright, there almost isn't any mileage limits anyway, and generally as long as you don't default on it they won't care about the cars condition as after the term it's yours. (keep it road legal). 

Alternatively cash purchase, own the car day 1, do whatever you want. And with a cash purchase you won't end up paying the interest of finance or other big fees (except a dealer fee maybe but that's also paid for finance).

My current car is on a HP plan for 5 years (although I plan to pay it off sooner). I did end up paying a bit more than it's value because I got it from Big Motoring World (absolutely no experience for their warranty yet but 3 years sounds good).

Had I bought it in cash (which I don't have lol) I could have saved ~5k worth of finance fees and interest, and well the additional warranty was about 3k ontop. 

As with other purchase options also, PCP does require any repairs to come out of pocket, and only new cars get any sort of included service as far as I've seen...and also MOT costs and service costs if not new.

The disruption is costing JLR an estimated £72M in lost sales per day, with 1,000 cars going unbuilt daily and thousands of workers told not to report to factories. Suppliers and retailers have also been hit, with many unable to access databases needed for parts sourcing or vehicle registrations. Hackers linked to groups including Lapsus$, Scattered Spider, and ShinyHunters posted screenshots allegedly from JLR’s internal systems. 

While the company admits “some data” was affected, it has not disclosed whether customer or supplier information was compromised. The Unite union has warned that thousands of supply chain jobs are at risk if the freeze extends into October and has urged the government to step in with support.

1nmle39,Backing out within 14 day cooling off period,"I know this was an incredibly stupid purchase and I will loose money. But for my own mental health I need to cancel it.

This week I signed an agreement for a car on finance. I paid £500 deposit on the car and £150 “care fee”. I haven’t picked up the car as it isn’t ready. Since signing the financial agreement I have had massive anxiety and it’s the best decision for me to cancel the car.

I plan on contacting the finance company on Monday to cancel as I am within my 14 day cooling off period. The issue is the dealership. This is what is in the agreement I signed with the dealership: “If for any reason the above named purchase forfeited and the vehicle shall be re advertised for sale subject to 10% commission and any loss to vendors made good by the purchase hirer deposits are refundable at the companies discretion”.

Does this mean I’m on the hook for 10% commission? I thought a dealership agreement had to be fair and proportional to the losses incurred by the dealership. I’ve accepted I’ve got the £500 deposit and £150 care fee. Ownership hasn’t been transferred to me so paying commission feels a bit unfair.

Anyways, I'm am just checking the rationale. As then you can calculate the cost of backing out. It seems liek the 10% of their commission is unknown, but this is their commission not the car sale price.. And idk how enforceable this is. 


Once you work out the cost of backing out, if will help you make the decision better I think. As well as explaining why you are backing out (eg, if it sounded like a, dodgy clutch, it sounds like the 500 plus 150 would cover a new one, so...)

Not a full refund within 14 days, be aware however it's only 13 days because day one is counted as a day. The charge we gave was circa £30 plus time on risk which was the number of days of insurance used pro rata. After day 14 however if the policy was paid for in full, a percentage was refunded. The amount of refund therefore changes significantly between day 13 and 14. So make sure you ask in advance and consider looking for temporary insurance. If you want the vehicle why not just buy the one policy and wait two weeks to drive it?

1nmft9l,Fatherhood and Midlife,"I’m not entirely sure what the point of this post is, but thought I’d share my situation as a person, at 37 and with a 7 month old baby, who has had a long affinity with cars. 

I’ve got a Macan S, I’ve had it for about 4.5 years, it’s an early model but is a great car in my opinion, based on looks, performance and functionality. High maintenance costs mind, even at a specialist non-Porsche garage, it has been noticeable vs prior cars.

Early last year, I was thinking about buying a 991.2 in a reasonable trim, as a fun car before growing up. This is a bit daft given I live in London, 5 minutes from a tube, have space for only one car on the drive and only use my Macan for about 10 miles a week, bar longer trips once a month back to family. 

I kyboshed the idea ultimately given that, then we found out my wife was pregnant, little boy born in January. Unfortunately having to drive very capitalist with with a new born does take a lot of the fun out of a performance based car. I did however buy a new car in tandem with the baby in January, a self specced T6 LWB camper (DSG 150 if anyone cares!).

It’s absolutely class as a car, the LWB fits in a standard car parking space and gives loads more room inside and I’ve got the seats/bed on rails so can move them forward and essentially have a van-type boot. I’ve gone a ton of places with my son already, that I wouldn’t have done otherwise, having just got back from 2.5 weeks around Scotland using my delayed pat leave. The Macan is unfortunately now up for sale (tried Motorway yesterday and they offered me a naff price, on the off chance anyone is looking for one I’ll go below market to get it gone, I don’t have time for haggling), until my circumstances move on and I can use a fast car again.

No point to this just wanted to share my view - I was in two minds with the purchase to some degree because it’s a lot of money for something if you can’t get on with it (albeit resale is excellent), so would recommend to anyone in a similar position.
