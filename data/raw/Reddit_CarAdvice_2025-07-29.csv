1mbwgdt,Allignment after control arm bushes on rally car?,"I have a 2007 Swift Sport rally car, and have two days to get it to its next rally, 9hr away. I got a wheel allignment over the weekend for it - but just noticed the rear lower control arm bushes were shot.

Very pressed for time, and driving quick on tarmac and braking hard it doesn’t seem to be pulling… but I know gravel is a different story!

Any previous work aside from brakes done on it? I work on transmissions at Allisons Transmission in Indiana and for your vehicle and year, it's usually about that time where the transmission breaks. How does the fluid look on the dipstick? I say breaks but it's usually a valve looses pressure somewhere and isn't able to engage the clutches. (Not likely the case here as the gear shifter would still be able to shift, just good general knowledge to have given the age.) Most likely a problem with the brake/shift interlock or the solenoids, but could be within the valve body. 


Check fuse #25 (Automatic Shift Lock Control System/BTSI) and fuse# 27 (Backup) to see if there is continuity. These are all under the main engine fuse box on your vehicle. 

Check for 12 volts on the #25 and #27 fuses during the run and start positions. These are located in the under-hood fuse block. Could be a faulty ignition switch

Check fluid level, and inspect fluid in the pan for excessive metallic debris.

Does the gear shift button press still or does it stay rock solid? If the shifter button won’t depress, inspect the shift interlock solenoid and brake light switch. A faulty solenoid or brake switch can block the button release. Check for blown fuses and ensure the brake lights activate when pressed. Lubricate the shifter button mechanism to reduce sticking. Replacing the solenoid or brake switch often resolves the issue, restoring normal gear shifting."

The only bolt should be on top. There is no lower bolt at all so nothing to be sheared off. Just rusted.

It does look like yours is pressed though so should be able to remove it. If it doesnt come out youd have to drill it out but it looks like it will come out.

You will need  a Ball Joint Press Tool.  You should be able to remove the old ball joint and install it with that tool. Not a cheap tool but you may be able to rent one. If you can rent it from auto parts store you get all your money back when you return the tool. If they dont rent it check Harbour Freight.

Bought this 06 3.5 Altima for $600. It was sitting in a driveway for 5 years or something so I put a new battery in it and drove it 5 minutes home. The power steering died completely as I got in my driveway so after some troubleshooting I replaced the power steering pump. 

After replacing the pump I took it on a few minute drive to let it get warm and see if the power steering felt good. Everything felt great for 5 minutes then when at stops I felt vibrations and it idled rough. I drove another few minutes and then the engine shut off. It took a minute to get it to start again to get it out of the street and when it started this time it sounded like it had less power in the engine and when I put it in gear and gave it gas it barely moved, it felt almost like a manual car with a bad clutch. 

Then I put it in reverse and as soon as I did it felt like it was trying to back up like I had it floored. It wasn’t revving but it was fighting to not move backwards. Letting go of the brakes for a second it shot backwards.

1mbr0uk,2020 Kia Soul won't start,"My parents' 2020 Kia Soul was running fine before letting it sit for about 6 months.  So I assumed it was just the battery, but when I replaced the battery (the auto parts store tested and said it was dead), still nothing.  I'm pretty sure I installed the battery properly but it's possible that's the issue.

Additional info:

*  It won't start with even a jump.  When I connect to either one of those battery starter tools or connect to another car the old fashioned way, that gives it enough to turn on the lights but then when I try and start the car it barely clicks (no chugging sound).
* With either the old or new battery, I wasn't able to turn on the lights or have anything electrical turn on.  That leads me to think I either got a bad battery or installed it incorrectly.

I suspect the issue is one or multiple of the following:

1.  I installed the battery incorrectly.  Is there anything to check for?  It looks connected the same way the old one.  I double checked the + vs. - and the connections are tight enough.
2. I got a dud battery from the parts store.  But why wouldn't I be able to start the car with a jump?
3. Bad battery connections - would make sense to me except why would those go bad just b/c the car sits for months?

Just turning on the lights takes less power than actually starting the car. To start the car you need all the amps. If the connections are oxidized it may not be able to transfer power at all. Remove the battery from the car and take fine sandpaper and sand the inside of the connections one at a time until they are shiny and are not gray. Then reinstall the new battery and try again.

1mbqv0a,Car stinks like clutch upon startup,"2017 Subaru BRZ 95k miles

I had the clutch/TOB replaced almost 2 years and 30k miles ago. For the last 6 months to a year (maybe longer idk) the car has smelled like clutch periodically with normal driving.

I’ve owned a manual car before and only smelled clutch twice (while I was learning), this has been almost daily.

I don’t ride the clutch, I don’t drive like a maniac, I don’t launch the car, I don’t botch shifts (maybe rarely lol). But I do exclusively city driving for a delivery gig. 

I mostly smell it after I’ve parked the car, gotten out to deliver, and then get back in to start it up. The smell seems to come thru the vents but sometimes I can smell it outside as I’m getting in.

Chevrolet Equinox (2010 - 2012) TPMS Reset Procedure


WITH STANDARD IGNITION:
1. Apply parking brake.
2. Turn ignition to ON position (engine off)
3. Press the MENU button on the DIC (located on turn signal lever on Camaro and on instrument cluster for all others) until the vehicle's tire pressures are displayed.
4. Press Set/Cir (this button is located at the end of the turn signal lever on Camaro). Vehicle asks “Are you sure that you want to relearn?” Select Yes.
5. Starting at LF tire, decrease air pressure until horn chirps. Repeat procedure for remaining tires in the following order: RF, RR, and LR. After completing LR tire, horn will sound twice.
6. Turn ignition to OFF position to exit vehicle learn mode. Adjust all tires to pressure listed on tire placard.

WITH PUSH-BUTTON START:
1. Press and hold the push button start until the vehicle is in accesory mode. Note: on Cadillac models you will know when you are in accessory mode the Cadillac emblem appears on the DIC.
2. Press the MENU button located on the turn signal lever until “VEHICLE INFORMATION MENU” is displayed.
3. Once you are in the VEHICLE INFORMATION MENU, use the ^ v on the turn signal level until the DIC displays the vehicle’s tire inflation pressure and positions.
4. Press and hold the button located on the end of the turn signal level until “Are you sure that you want to relearn? YES or NO” is displayed.
5. Use the ^ v on the turn signal lever to highlight YES. Once YES is highlighted, press the button located on the end of the turn signal lever. The horn will chirp, “Tire Learning Active” will be displayed on the DIC, and the left front turn signal will be illuminated.
6. Beginning with the left front frire, use a TPMS activation tool to activate the left front sensor. Once the sensor has been activated, the horn will chirp and the right front turn signal will be illuminated.Repeat procedure in the following order, right front sensor, right rear sensor, and finally the left rear sensor. Once the left rear sensor has been activated, the horn will chirp twice. You can then turn the vehicle off to exit “learn mode.”

tpms_exper (Score: 1): It seems that the issue is caused by switching the positions of the front tires without re-matching the sensors. The sensor in the right front tire is faulty, but the display shows an issue with the left front. You just need to replace the right front tire pressure sensor and re-match the sensors in the order of left front, right front, right rear, and left rear to correct the problem."
1mbq1j8,Dealership service required for air intake issue?,"TLDR: CEL came on with P0101 code, but nothing improved after I put in a new MAF sensor. A respected local shop said that meant the issue was electrical and they wouldn't be able to do anything because it would require a dealership's software. The soonest appointment at a dealership is in 4 weeks. Another shop said they'd look at it, but will they just tell me the same thing after I pay for their diagnosis?

My CEL recently came on in my 2019 Chevy Cruze (LT 1.4L DI Turbo DOHC). The engine is idling rough, has reduced power, is making ticking and whistling noises, it's shifting poorly, and is apt to stall. I also think my radiator fan is running longer/louder than usual after I turn the engine off, but my gauge doesn't indicate that the engine is running hot and my coolant level looks good. The car also cancels my cruise control past \~40 mph. P0101 is what triggered the CEL, but I've also pulled P1101, P0299, P00F4, P0097, P2229, P2227, P0113, P0102, and P0172.

I put in a new MAF sensor and engine air filter, but I am still experiencing all of the same symptoms. I also visually inspected the intake air ducts for any cracks or blockages, but there were no obvious issues to my untrained eye.

I don't have the time or knowledge to keep troubleshooting it myself, but when I explained everything to a shop they said they wouldn't be able to do anything more than what I'd already done. They said that if the new sensor hadn't worked, it had to be an electrical issue and only a dealership would be able to do the necessary re-configuring.  I appreciate them telling me that upfront to try and save me the cost of their own diagnosis, but I don't understand how it couldn't still be another issue like a vacuum leak or wiring problem? Another shop said I could bring it in, but I don't want to pay for their diagnosis if it's already obvious they can't do anything. The soonest availability at a dealership is in 4 weeks.

I don't know if this is related, but last summer I had a somewhat similar issue where the car suddenly started shifting poorly, my fuel economy worsened, and I had less response from the gas pedal. I never got a CEL or experienced any of the other symptoms, but it never went back to normal. If it matters, both instances were on very hot days where I was running my AC higher than usual. I had my transmission fluid flushed just before a road trip to try and help, but during that trip the car dropped out of 6th gear and couldn't get past 5th for \~400 miles. I took it in and they didn't find anything wrong with the transmission, but I couldn't afford any issues on my return trip so the transmission got fully rebuilt. The same problem with 6th did happen again for part of the drive back, but ever since then it's had no issues (until now).

Currently, I live paycheck to paycheck and I can just barely afford my $320 per month payment on my car loan. My car was supposed to be paid off in April 2026. Cars with similar mileage in my area, or slightly higher (~70-90K), have higher monthly payments (~$450) and I don't have any down payment money. 

The engine replacement will likely be around 8K (7K engine plus about 2K labor). My parents and I are looking into a personal loan to cover paying off my car loan and the repairs. My parents have found a loan offer through their bank for a low interest rate and a monthly payment of $270 for 3 years. However, its only for 8K and I need around 10K to pay off the repairs and car loan. I can't get a higher loan because I have student debt and that makes my debt to income ratio too high. However, I could put the additional 2K on a credit card I have for emergencies and make minimum payments on it until I paid off the personal loan. Then I would funnel the money I'd be paying on the loan onto the credit card until I paid the card off in full. 

Basically, I'm between a rock and a hard place. It's starting to feel very damned if I do and damned if I don't. I just need some advice from other mechanics on if this repair is worth it. Other than this happening, my car has been great. I took it in for any and all required maintenance. There wasn't a warning before this happened. I didn't notice it running any differently or acting strangely. The checks I had always done when getting my oil changed never showed any issues with the vehicle.

(For a bit of additional context, I live just under 2 hours away from my hometown, where my parents live. They can't afford to take me to work every day or to run errands. Right now, I'm bumming rides from my friends and coworkers but I feel like I'm putting them out, even though they say I'm not. I also don't live in an area with public transport that would take me to my job, or even close to it... I guess I just need someone to tell me if this repair cost would be worth it.

I posted before but thought I found the culprit before I got any answers. I was not hearing any priming of the fuel pump when turning the key so I thought that was my issue. Original post is down below.

I swapped relays with a new one since the pump works and flows well when connecting the vertical plug receiver with the horizontal one. New relay seems the same as the old one, no priming with key in the on position, no sound while starting.

I tried to start the car with the pump running (the relay jumped) and nothing. Turns over nicely but no firing is happening. Plan is to pull spark plugs and get a fuel pressure tester but I feel stumped after my eureka moment failed me.

I feel like the car is not asking for fuel. I have no clue.

Original Post:  
Felt a loss of power on hills, check engine light came on soon after. Threw code P0160, no activity on bank 2 sensor 2 O2 sensor.

It started again twice, let me drive to work and back home, yet it struggled to start and idled rough. Still could go 80 on the highway as long as it wasn't up hill. I feel like it was running lean. I went out of town and now it wont start.

I changed the bank 2 sensor 2 O2 sensor since I am a fairly successful throw parts at it Youtube mechanic. No fix.

It sounds like it is not getting fuel. I tried to starting it with starting fluid, the engine fires maybe once or twice but just barely.

I tried pulling the fuel pump fuse, the issue sounds the same. I can hear the fuel pump relay kick over but cannot hear the fuel pump kick on.

I removed the fuel pump and hooked 12 volts up to it, it works, seems to pump fine.

I am stumped. I am not sure why it wont run on starting fluid, though I have never used it on non carbureted engine before. I sprayed it after the MAF sensor but was doing it solo, so a few second spray to turning the key as fast as possible..

Plan is to remove the fuel filter, then run the pump and see what happens. Maybe get a fuel pressure gauge as well. And finally take apart the dash and switch a relay around.

We attempted to bend the bracket back into position which seemed to visually realign the alternator pulley. After putting the serpentine belt back on the pulley immediately the alternator bracket bent making the pulley back out of alignment. We towed the truck to a shop. The shop said that the entire engine block bracket needs replaced because the bottom bolt of the alternator can't be removed because of the bolt head being sheared off.

While a new, stiff, tight belt can make the tensioner jump like that for a bit (until it’s worn in a bit), it shouldn’t make the engine/vehicle shake. That’s something else.

I have rotated the crankshaft several times without the timing chain on and I have no idea which one the compression tdc or exhaust tdc. How do I perform a spark plug air test with conclusive results? 
   Tdc of compression is when cam os at 12 oclock (rotor points at #1 when cam sprocket dot is at 12 oclock)
Option: (what do I doooo)
  1.timing chain off, cam resting at 6 oclock(180 degrees off comp. Tdc) spark plug hole test on crank(what should results be)
  2. timing chain off, cam resting at 12 oclock(180 degrees off comp. Tdc) spark plug hole test on crank(what should results be)
  3. Align dots and see what happens when dots meet or can gets to 12(supposed to betdc comp. For cylinder 1) — and then do spark plug air test and if I don’t get correct results(what results should I get?) then take off timing chain and rotate crank 360 degrees and try again and make sure I get the right results
  4. Take off valve cover and do one of the above and determine from looking at valves/pistons or whatever?

I’m not an experienced mechanic but all this car needs(rly good condition under 100,000)is for the crankshaft to be aligned. Then when I put the belts back on and new oil new gas she should run just fine like it did for the year that I had it. I stopped driving it 2 years ago when the timing chain broke and now all I have to do is figure out what crank rotation to align it to and put it back together and she should run. 

It starts up dispute whether the crank is aligned on exhaust/comp stroke. So I can’t test it that way. One one 360 degree turn it is much quieter and when I put the timing chain on with the crank in the other 360 degree turn it is much louder-almost too loud but it was always like that. So I really don’t know. 

Bottom line is that I have no idea what crank rotation it’s on, exhaust or compression. How do I figure it out so that I can align the dots when the crank is on tdc of exhaust (since tdc of compression for cylinder #1 is when cam sprocket dot is at 12 oclock, since rotor points to #1 distributor spark plug terminal at 12 oclock)

When running A/c on occasion it will die when coming to a stop or idle for extended period. It can die without A/C but far less common, so this is a load issue. 

It also seems to be something fuel related so I'm looking for known fuel struggles. When below 1/4 tank the sending unit loses accuracy entirely. Fluctuates as it wishes. We know this to be an issue as it seems it's tendency to die is related to lower fuel levels. 

Once it dies it is a pain in the ass to get to start back up. Long long long crank, or key on/off to cycle fuel pump and eventually it'll come back and drive like nothing happened. 

My question is, do you think this is a fuel pump getting hot when low fuel levels come around or more towards the IAC.

1mbm5ny,Update re: my mechanic sent me this video— what am I looking at please? AKA Chocolate Syrup Fountain Engine,"2016 Chevy Malibu LS 34,000 miles 4cly 1.5L Turbo

Thanks everyone who earnestly attempted to answer my questions regarding the oil video my mechanic sent me. I was totally overwhelmed with the response— I did not expect over 2,000 comments and loads of pms. I’ve tried my best to get through as many as I could, and just wanted to say thank you to all who genuinely shared their insight about my car’s condition. This has been a very stressful event, emotionally and financially, and I appreciate those who attempted to help guide me through this time. 

Now for the update: instead of an engine rebuild he originally recommended, the mechanic today said we should just replace the engine. He found a good priced one (90k miles). Should I be concerned that I am replacing my 30k engine with a 90k engine? Clearly my engine is a just a chocolate syrup fountain, and he said the replacement engine is in better condition. 

He assured me that, with proper upkeep, including induction cleanings (either annually or every 10,000 or so miles), I should be able to have a lot of life left in the car by replacing the engine. 

I have a lot of questions now regarding the way this engine functions. In the last few days I’ve learned that this engine is prone to carbon buildup, and the short-distance trips I take are not ideal as the engine doesn’t have time to get hot and burn the carbon off. My question is, my car automatically shuts off at red lights— because this is a direct injection engine, is that contributing to the carbon buildup which caused the damage to the engine? Is there a way to turn off that feature? 

After this massive financial investment, I want to be sure I am taking the best care of the replacement engine as I possibly can. I know a lot of people have advised me to get rid of this car, but my financial situation does not allow me to do so at this time. (This car is paid off, and trading it in towards another car would give me another monthly bill for a car payment, as well as a massive bill increase for full coverage insurance.) I would like to be able to get another couple of years out of this car if possible. 

Thanks again for teaching me so much about my car in the last few days— there was so much good advice I’ll take with me going forward.

Couple questions to start, I know you said in your last post that you routinely had oil changed at or before 5,000 miles (perfect keep that up) my question is, do you have your oil changed at the same location who currently has your vehicle? Secondly the shop that currently has the vehicle and drained the oil, any chance the measured how many quarts of oil came out of the vehicle? Bases of my question, regardless of the make and model of a vehicle there should be ALMOST no excuse to need an engine at 34,000 miles. Realistically speaking the only two likely causes for this are manufacturer defect or improper maintenance. Seeing as you had oil changed every 5k the only other option in the maintenance category is if the last shop to do the oil change failed to add enough oil or left the plug loose/cross threaded where oil leaked (you likely would’ve noticed an oil leak of that caliber. If the shop didn’t measure the amount of oil that came out this visit it’s impossible to say weather it was their fault or not and it probably won’t serve you well at this point to accuse them. This brings us to Option 2: manufacturer defect, the nice thing with GM is their vehicles have a 60-100k powertrain warranty. With the investment you’re looking at my recommendation to you is, reach out to your local GM dealership and explain the issue. They will need all maintenance records to prove you’ve had your oil changed. I would recommend having the vehicle towed to your local dealer, explain the issues and bring them your maintenance records there’s a pretty good chance this could be covered by GM with the right dealer/advisor. I’m not, nor would I recommend accusing the shop who has your vehicle now or the one who has done previous maintenance. However I will tell you there is almost no reason a 34k mile vehicle should need an engine replacement if it was properly maintained. As for the rest of this post in regard to fuel induction service and auto start/stop, I can promise you that neither of those were the cause nor will they prevent this in the future. Please let me know if you have any other questions about this process.

Brakes can drag and cause a pull, suspension components can be loose and your alignment might be out while youre actually driving.

Alternatively, you could leave the doors open and let it air-dry, but that would probably take a long time.

TLDR: At a crossroads for keeping 84k '04 Impala in and out of shop or getting something newer and more reliable. Need reliable vehicle for hour NE US commute but want to make sound financial decision. Thank you!

This past August (2024), I got an '04 Impala 3.4L with 70k on it. Since then, it has been in the shop 5 times. There was a fluid leak, serpentine belt replacement, ignition cable replacement, sway bar replacement (2 weeks ago), and now my car is in the shop one week into my new job. I recently moved to the northeast and have an hour commute so need something reliable.

The impala now has 84k on it, and part of me thinks if I used it as a beater it could last a while. Another part of me thinks getting something new(er) or new and more reliable would be a better investment. Still, I would need something that could endure the wear and tear of bumper to bumper stop and go traffic without beating it into submission.

I am trying to make the best financial decision above all. Getting a brand new car scares me because I have never undertook such a large financial ""burden"", depreciation, and so on. Mainly looking 2015 and newer Mazda, Honda, and Toyota, or certified used.

Anyway, the point of this post is I wanna know if investing more money into this car is worth it?

To be clear: nothing is wrong with this car currently! I just wanna put some time and money into it to make it more enjoyable until it won’t be anymore.

I decided to get custom plates finally, got some tinting last year, but I wanna get all the body dents and missing paint fixed.

I was even thinking a custom paint job would be cool cause the white just doesn’t connect with me. I also wanna get an interior deep cleaning done cause I used to smoke cigarettes while driving years ago, probably needs a good scrubbing.

Is it worth it?

What I’d love some guidance on is:

I accidentally had my old work company’s corporate rate code in my account/attached to this reservation. It had the damage waiver included. When Enterprise saw this, they pinged me and alerted me. I told them I switched jobs last month, and completely forgot the rate was on it (I made this car reservation back in February).

Please note: the scratch was entirely cosmetic, just large. The car drives perfectly, the door works perfectly, no damage to the foot step on the car, etc…

Therefore, given the corporate rate was not valid, neither is the damage waiver - massive fuck up on my part.

Based on other reddit discussions, I immediately reached out to Progressive, with whom we have our personal vehicle auto insurance. 

Based on the above information, do you guys think:
- I did the next best responsible thing of alerting my car insurance company?
- I have both collision and comprehensive auto coverage, so do you think one of these options will help cover some of the cost for this rental car damage?

""Mmm,How can I explain it?""... It would ""ka'plunk"" so to speak. Yes I know that's not the ideal description but that's basically kinda how it sounded and how it felt. And it wouldn't happen at every stop, just every so often. And it never died out or had problems starting or shifting gears and at this time it still doesn't have those issues . At the beginning of these episodes there were no other symptoms to show anything was wrong. Then it started happening a little bit more often than usual. and then after a few weeks the check engine light would occasionally turn on then the next time we started the car it would be off again. Then last weekend we drove from Tacoma to Bellingham and on the way back home there was bumper to bumper traffic on SB-I-5 and the car started doing the ""ka'plunk"" thing just about every time we came to a stop, as it was a slow stop-n-go for a good mile (at the least). And then it was shortly accompanied by the ""check engine light"" again throughout the rest of the trip home back to Tacoma. But then after a few hours after we made it home I had to go to the store and noticed the check engine light wasn't on anymore and the ""ka-plunk thing didn't happen at all on the way there and then back from the store. I was told by someone at O'Reilly's, that did a diagnostics test on it, that it was a transmission sensor code. But that was all the info I got. Which really doesn't help. Since I am a woman that knows nothing about cars, he probably figured it was useless to clue me in on the code number that came up. And I am not made of money nor do I have any extra saved, since times have been difficult living on a fixed income.

1mbvyrt,Head bolt thread repair,"Hello everyone,

My friend's car overheated due to a broken radiator, which caused the head gasket to fail. The car isn't worth much, so taking it to a repair shop didn’t make sense financially. We decided to try fixing it ourselves, and everything went pretty smoothly—until it was time to tighten the head bolts.

Three of the bolt holes have damaged threads, and the head bolts won’t tighten properly. The original bolts are M11x1.5 and about 160 mm long (with roughly 70 mm of thread). Now we’re trying to figure out the best way to fix the damaged threads.

From what I understand, the original threads need to be drilled out, and then we need to tap new, larger threads. But you can’t just tap M12 into an M11 hole, right? So we’d have to go up to M13. The problem is that M13 bolts are very hard to find, while M12, M14, M15, and M16 are much more common.

That raises a few concerns:

Should we drill and tap for M14 instead, just to make bolts easier to source?

The larger the hole we drill, the more off-center the result might be. Is this a real issue when it comes to head bolts?

Could drilling larger holes weaken the cylinder head/block?


Our original idea was to use Helicoils or Time-Serts, but those seem to be limited to just a few centimeters in length, and the original thread depth is much longer than that. If a long enough insert existed, we could have just tapped M13 and used M12 bolts, which are easy to find.

Since the car is not worth much, we feel it’s worth trying some kind of fix. If it works—great. If not, then it’s not a big loss.

If anyone has experience with this kind of thread repair (especially on head bolts), we’d really appreciate any advice or alternative ideas we might not have thought of.

[https://youtube.com/shorts/MCjRl6Db1hg?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/MCjRl6Db1hg?feature=share)  
  
I committed the ultimate DIY car owner's sin, and took my car to a Dealer service for a brake job. Please spare me the ""rock auto"" talk. I made a conscious decision to pay for the job, to pay far more to have a dealer tech do it right, than do it myself.

\---  
**Before**:  Brake performance was fine. no Judder, no shake. There was a light/faint squeal while braking, and the car had done 70k miles without pads.

**Service**: AC Delco pads front and rear, machining on all four existing rotors.

**After:** (100 miles post repair):

* Brake performance is exactly as good as before.
* 'foot off the brake' the car rolls silently.
* Judder and shake in the steering wheel when decelerating from 60-25mph. It's always present, but severity varies depending on the day. (more detail at bottom)
* Low speed: Rear brake (I think one side) makes ""hhh hhh hhhh hhhh hhh"" sound when light pressure is applied. sound goes away once ""normal pressure"" is applied.

Do you think I just need to wait ***another 200 mile?*** to see if the brakes ""wear in"" and stop juddering? should I break-loose and re-torque the lugs? I've got an appointment in two days to have a tech do a driving test to try and feel the shudder.

\* more detail about Judder:  
Every time the brakes are applied it can be felt: The severity changes between braking instances: 45% of the time, it's gentle; only feel it the steering wheel. 50% the steering wheel visibly shakes, and while it can be felt, nothing in the car rattles. 5% it gets some harmonic and shakes the wheel heavily rattling the spare change in the cupholder.

\* more info on machining: The rotors didn't look like they were processed on a lathe, rather some sort of grinder.

 I have an 03 ford ranger edge in the shop. Its got the 4.0 and 5r44e transmission, rwd only. So, I did an oil pan gasket then a rear main seal on it. My problem is, once i put the trans back in, it wont go into reverse. The only time reverse works, is within the first minute of startup, or if i unplug the 16 pin connector to the shift solenoids and valvebody. It will just rev up, but as soon as i UNPLUG that connector itll slam into reverse. Ive had this things for a week longer than im supposed to, ive taken it back out and my coworker has disassembled the transmission to check it out and says everything is all good. Range selector is good as far as we are concerned, scanner data shows me the correct info for the gear selector, in my data, i can watch my intermediate shaft speed go from 0 to 650 ish rpm after i start it up. 

Im stumped, identifix doesnt give me many answers except for a band issue, which has been checked.  Im at such a loss on this. I also am getting a case of ""i touched it last, so i broke it."" If anyone has an answer, id appreciate some help.

1mb5cj3,"2019 Honda Civic LX p0344 code and safety features ""problem""","I bought this Civic about 6 months ago and started having this issue about three months into owning it. 

It's a 2019 base model with the 2.0 NON turbo engine. Only 44,000 miles.

One day while sitting in traffic, the dash lit up with things like ""lane keep assist problem, collision mitigation problem, emissions problem, auto high beam problem"" and maybe one or two others like these related to the safety sensing features. The check engine light also came on. I drove home without issue.

I used a cheap OBD2 scanner and pulled a p0344 ""camshaft position sensor A intermittent signal"" code. 

After a ton of googling and civic forum browsing I decided to start at something simple and bought a brand new battery despite the previous battery testing as good. After the new battery was in, everything went back to normal for like 2 weeks. 

Then all the same ""problems"" and p0344 code came back but the car drove fine again. I would just clear the code and continue driving. Sometimes it would take just one day or sometimes a few days but eventually all the same symptoms would return.

So I replaced the camshaft position sensor in the A spot and didn't have the dash lights or the code come back for almost a full month.

Today they all came back on again and the car has some jerking, for lack of a better term. I have to kind of baby the acceleration for it to shift at first, but then it runs somewhat smoothly. Although, if I approach 3k rpms the car bucks really hard.

I'm a novice with this type of thing so I'm hoping to get some ideas on other things to look at before sending it in and having a huge repair bill. 

A couple things that kind of standout to me are that every time the warnings go off, it just happens to be an extremely hot and sunny day. Also, if I clear the codes, they usually trigger again at the end of a longer commute. Like if I've had the car running for 45 minutes or so it seems like the likelihood of it happen increase rather than if I've only taken it for a short ride. These might be completely coincidentally though, just trying to include as much info as I can.

I was confused because one video said the battery wire should show 12.7 or so but others said it should be around 5. So I'm thinking this tested fine as well.

Then I did the test where you measure the signal wire voltage and place a metal wrench at the end of the cam position sensor itself and it should drop the voltage down to 0 each time and rebound back to 4.80 once removed.

My sensor passed this test too except the voltage would go down to 0.2 when the metal wrench passed over the sensor instead of a flat 0.0. 

Does that indicate a problem?

1. Fuel Injector Tick (Normal)

These engines have loud injectors. Using a stethoscope, they sound like sharp tapping. If the noise matches the injector rhythm and isn’t deeper or metallic, it may be normal.



2. Exhaust Manifold Leak

A small leak at the exhaust manifold or gasket can sound exactly like a tick.

How to check:

Listen near the manifold with the stethoscope or a hose.

Check for black soot marks on the gasket area.

The noise is often louder on cold start and may fade a bit as the metal expands.




3. Timing Chain Tensioner (Common on 2.3L Duratec)

If the tensioner or guides wear, you’ll hear a light tick or rattle that follows RPM.

Usually comes from the front of the engine, not the valve cover itself.



4. Hydraulic Lash Adjusters (HLAs) / Valve Train Noise

If one of the HLAs is sticking or has air, it can tick.

Marvel Mystery Oil can help, but if the tick hasn’t changed after a few hundred miles, it may not be an HLA.



5. Bottom End (Rod Bearing)

A rod bearing tick is deeper and louder under load, especially on acceleration, and may not be picked up on the valve cover.

Quick test: Lightly rev in neutral and let off quickly. If you hear a knock on decel, suspect bottom end.





---

✅ What to Do Next:

Use a long screwdriver or stethoscope on different parts: valve cover, block, front timing cover, exhaust manifold. See where it’s loudest.

Check for exhaust leaks: hold a rag over the tailpipe briefly at idle. If you hear hissing/ticking at the manifold, that’s your leak.

Observe under load: Does the tick get louder when accelerating vs. just revving in neutral? That can help separate valve/exhaust noise from bottom end knock."
1mb1rjw,"Help - 2016 Corolla starts fine cold, but stutters after sitting in heat","Hey y’all, I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction. I have a 2016 Toyota Corolla LE that has had issues starting in the past week. Brief history of my car:

* Replaced the battery in December
* Replaced the starter in January
* Just replaced all spark plugs last week
* The battery died the day after and was replaced again under warranty

It starts perfectly fine cold/sitting overnight. But after I drive (like 20 mins to work) and let it sit in the heat for a couple hours, it stutters when starting. There's a longer crank, feels like it barely catches. After work (so even more heat soak), it gets worse. I live in Florida if that helps give any context.

I took it to a mechanic Friday morning and he had no issues starting the car and didn't hear the stuttering. He said the crankshaft sensor tested fine, but the car hadn’t been driven more than 5 minutes and it was before it got hotter than 80 degrees.

The mechanic told me to bring the car back if I still experienced stuttering when starting up my car, but asked me to come with suggestions of what I thought it might be. I have absolutely no car knowledge, which is why I'm posting on here with hopes to get any suggestions. Attached is a video of me trying to start my car after work last night.

🔍 Common Causes:

1. Weak Fuel Pressure (Hot Soak Loss)

When the car sits hot, fuel in the rail can vaporize or leak down if the check valve in the fuel pump isn’t holding pressure.

This causes longer cranks because the system has to re-pressurize.

Test: Next time it’s hot, turn the key to ON (without starting) for 5 seconds, off, then ON again, then start. If it fires up quicker, it’s a fuel pressure bleed issue.



2. Crankshaft Position Sensor (Intermittent Heat Failure)

Even though it “tested fine,” sensors often fail when hot and recover when cool.

A failing CKP sensor can cause extended crank or a no-start when heat-soaked.



3. Battery Voltage Drop Under Heat

Florida heat can cause borderline connections to act up. A weak ground or corroded terminal can cause the starter to spin slower when hot even with a new battery.



4. Evap System Purge Valve Sticking

If the purge valve sticks open, it can flood the intake with fuel vapor after sitting in heat, making starts rough until the mixture clears.



5. Starter Heat Soak

Even though you replaced the starter, on some cars the solenoid can get sluggish when it’s hot. If the crank sounds slow or labored when hot, this might be it.





---

✅ What You Can Do:

Listen to the crank: Is it spinning normal speed and just struggling to catch, or is it slow and labored? (Normal speed points to fuel/sensor; slow points to starter/voltage issue.)

Try the fuel prime trick: Cycle the key ON/OFF twice before starting after a hot soak.

Scan for pending codes: Even if the check engine light is off, a code reader may show pending misfire or sensor faults."

But I'm wanting my windows to roll down automatically when I pull into my garage and possibly force the fog-lights to turn on as well (must be done manually on my Audi). There are other GPS-related functions that I feel would be very fun to mess around with once we make a few additional steps.

He's building a multi-chip board that'll be powered through the OBD port and will include GPS, compass and other required modules. The issue is the vehicle CAN systems. All of our cars are pre-2021, *I'm told this makes a difference?*

The actual plugin part I was told is not an issue in regards to programming by my friend, it's determining the CAN signals within the car that will be tough to find. I have a Snapon ETHOS Edge scanner that will allow for file writing and more (I never use this thing). Can I pull the required PID CANBUS data relating to the windows and headlights with this tool? If so, what will it look like, roughly? 

With my ETHOS Edge, I can perform a myrad of ""active tests"" which include the functions I wish to achieve via activation of the plugin (after authorization of the GPS data within the chip)

That said, you are handling the trigger yourself (ie your GPS module) and you've already found that your scantool can send a diagnostic function to roll down your windows, so that may very well be all you need, and can be easier than doing a CAN injection anyway. Figure out what your tool is sending to perform the action you want, and then replay that upon your trigger.

My expectation would be that you're dealing with UDS Service 31 commands. I had found Porsche BCMs to be pretty cooperative with those, without imposing much restriction at all, as long as the ignition was on and you use Service 10 to start a diagnostic session first (and use 3E Tester Present as a keep-alive). VAG shares much of the same architecture. My hope for you would be that it's just straightforward UDS CAN, and doesn't involve needless complexity of VW TP 2.0.

Pro-tip: If you see your tool doing a Service 27 Seed/Key to unlock the module, try omitting that. Most BCM stuff on these cars won't need a security unlock, but some tools just do it every time regardless."

Often times customers get real sensitive about their cars after picking them up and want to notice tiny little things suddenly that they didn’t see before, but are just so sure happened while in the shops care. When the reality is it was always there or happened just before and they didn’t notice it. It’s a psychological thing people get all in their heads about because they’re just so sure we’re fucking around with customers cars and having shit happen that we’re gonna lie about.

It sounds like to me the car just needs to relearn its idle and shift point parameters. That often happens when the battery is changed m/disconnected and everything is reset again. You need to just drive it and keep driving it and it will get better. Check the code you have for the check engine light. 


Simply put, as you’re describing it either doesn’t make sense, shouldn’t be happening, or you have another problem unrelated to changing your battery. 

If all you did was get a new battery and have a new battery put in then you shouldn’t have acceleration problems. Unless, like I said, by acceleration problems you mean the car isn’t running right and shifting right. In that case it should clear up with more driving. If it doesn’t then you need to go to a mechanic and have someone actually look at your car because there’s something else going on that none of us on the internet can do for you."

Otherwise a big commercial quality ZTR if you need a nice finish cut. 

You definitely want something that can give a decent cut at around 10 mph.

Just for example, John Deere Z900 mowers come with decks up to 72” wide and can cut at 12mph.

Those specs would require more than 1 hour to cut 10 acres going full tilt the entire time. 

A standard residential mower probably won’t go any faster than 5-6 mph, and won’t have a deck bigger than 54”. That would take over 3 hours per cut, again going max speed the whole time. 

And electric ones just don’t have the range/battery capacity yet. You’d be having to recharge or swap batteries partway through."

I took it to a specialty, and reputable 4x4 shop fort alignment and road force balancing.

Two weeks ago I noticed the family van was cranking a little slow. Saturday I noticed it but wasn't sure, Sunday it was more pronounced. Wednesday it barely turned over at all (my wife had driven it a couple times in between). I trickle charged it and it would start fine, but showed the same decline following days like the battery isn't charging. I've looked into the three causes I can think of:

Parasitic drain. I checked for any current flowing while the engine's off, I only measured 20mA. Everything I've read says less than 50 is okay.

Bad battery. Open circuit voltage reads 11.8V. A bit on the low side, but I got it load tested at OReilly's and they said it checks out great. Also supporting this is the fact that it's only a year old, and actually a respectable brand (for once I didn't just cheap out and get it at Walmart).

Bad alternator. This is what I'd suspected, and what O'Reilly's said to check next. But voltage at the battery terminals while running reads 14.5V, which is great. I'd heard of some cases where the alternator can output full voltage but drops out when it tries to deliver current to the battery. I don't really understand this, but I didn't have any other ideas so I swapped it out. But now a couple drives later it's clear there's not really any difference.

1mbmvcc,Interested in a used GX460 but one service record has me concerned.,"So I've been looking at high'ish mileage GX460's for a few months. A 170k mile one popped up locally with a used car dealer. Carfax shows it is a one owner vehicle and it was serviced almost exclusively through a Lexus dealer.

I saw no specific mention of the timing chain or water pump being changed and at this mileage, I would have hoped to have seen it done by now.

I called up the Lexus dealer and the service writer looked it up for me. No timing chain or water pump done BUT she mentioned something that was excluded in the carfax: Radiator replaced and bank 1 head gasket replaced in April 2025 (when the Lexus dealer sent it to wholesale so it makes sense they didn't report it to carfax since it wasn't a customer repair). Presumably the owner got a quote to repair whatever it was and decided it wasn't worth it to them and traded it in as-is.

Now I know these engines are STOUT. But a bad radiator coupled with a head gasket replacement leads me to believe either A: The owner overheated it due to the bad radiator and it took out the bank 1 headgasket with it or B: the bank 1 headgasket was bad and it gummed up the coolant system and the dealer just opted to replace the radiator at the same time rather than try to flush it.

1mbh80e,2 mechanic shops can't figure out the problem.,"Long story, I own a 2004 nissan frontier, I get in it one day and it won't start, no clicking sound nothing turning over when I turn the key, just dead silence. I decide to do some self diagnostic and test the battery, check out the terminals, I notice the negative terminal is siezed, and I can't loosen or tighten it up any further. Still can't get it started so I just call the tow truck to have it towed, tow truck driver gets there and starts it right up no problem. I'm stunned, I tell him to hold off on towing it.

I'm thinking now it must be that negative terminal, and it just happened to be in the right place for it to start. So..I replace the negative terminal, and everything is tight. Works for about a day and then does the same thing as mentioned before. So now I have it actually towed to a shop, apparently they were able to start it fine at the shop, and they kept for a week starting it everyday, and it started without issue. They tell me since it's starting fine they don't really know what to replace.

So I take it back and it starts fine...for about a week, then the same thing happens. So...I call the tow truck driver again this time to be towed to a different shop...he gets in and starts it right up...once again I'm stunned, and I actually ask him what he's doing to get it started and he says ""I'm just jiggling the key and trying it different ways that was about the 6th try before it started.""  When I heard this I was like ahhh maybe that is it then. The problem is right there in the ignition part. 

Anyway, I call the new shop it's going to and tell them this, and basically it's a repeat of the same thing from the first shop...the truck starts fine for them the entire time they have it, and they tell me they don't know what to fix because it's starting fine...I even mention that this has already happened once, and I'm afraid if I go pick it up it will work for about a week again,  and the same thing will happen. They say there's nothing they can do so I go pick it up.

Finally, when I get back home with it I read online that if your key is worn, that could be a problem, so I compare the main key to the spare key, and the main key is definitely worn in a lot of places, so I thought this must be it, and I strictly used the spare key for about a week in a half.... until it happened again.. with the spare key...

If it's an automatic, the next time it doesn't start move the gearshift to neutral and try again. The neutral safety switch that is going bad or out of adjustment will keep the vehicle from starting. 
If it's a manual transmission, the safety switch on the clutch pedal may be bad or out of adjustment. Try pushing the clutch pedal extra hard and see if it will start. There is a rubber plug that will sometimes break off the pedal arm and not push the switch all the way.
My guess is the neutral switch is out of adjustment and sometimes it doesn't register that the transmission is in park. The shop probably just goes out and starts the truck without putting it in gear and then back into park."

Before this tyre change, they've always seemed to wear pretty evenly. Could something have been knocked out of alignment? Tracking? Could it have happened when the tyres were changed, or maybe before or after then?

1mbb8k8,Camshaft Position Sensor - No Start Question,"Hi everyone.

I have a 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee CRD 3.0, Australian.

Currently sitting on a no-start condition, though it cranks. I had a guy put the pro OBDII on it (mine is cheap and doesn't show P codes) and he said it gave a P code for the camshaft position sensor. He erased it before I could get the specific code... I wasn't impressed, but he wasn't massively impressive in how he handled it. Anyway, this is the info I have.

The camshaft position sensor (workshop manual suggests there's only one) o-ring had split and oil leaked. Replaced that, ended up replacing the sensor, cleaned the connector out with contact cleaner, reinstalled.

Car still won't start. Just turns over but no firing. Engine light is on, no other warnings. No DTCs that I can see with my scanner.

My question is this: Do I have to clear the code before it will start, or is this a sign that I have not actually fixed the underlying issue? I have ordered the USB dongle so that I can address the codes, but it won't come for a while and I'm wondering if there's other stuff I should be trying in the meantime.

Thanks in advance for the help!

1mba6ml,"Help programming my tires, 2017 Cadillac ATS","Hi y'all.

so recently I've been trying to program the tires on my 2017 Cadillac ATS with a relearn tool (pic of the one I used attached).

The first three tires seem to program just fine, as I hear the honk on each one (front driver side, front passenger side, back passenger side) while I have the vehicle's tires in learning mode.
Where I'm having issues is the driver back wheel, which will not program no matter where I hold the relearn tool.

It should be noted that the rim on this tire that I'm having issues with doesn't match the other three rims, as the original rim is currently in the shop being repaired for a crack.
Could this tire be having issues due to a different rim or is there something that I'm missing on why I could be having issues?

Anyway, I was heading to this house party and I was properly excited. I had the car, I had some music lined up, and there was this girl going to the same party who I sort of had my eye on. I thought, this is it. I’ve got the car now, I’m going to the party, it’s all going to happen.

A few mates asked for a lift and I said yes, no problem. I was going to pick up the girl as well, she was a friend of a friend, so it felt like everything was lining up. I’m cruising down in the Volvo estate, feeling like a legend, little bit of Billy Joel on the stereo, something classy.

We get to the party, but straight away it’s that classic thing. The girl’s talking to loads of other blokes, not really paying me any attention. I’m sat there not drinking because I’m driving, just sort of watching her chat to other guys, and generally not having a great time.

Then someone says, “Let’s go pick up Vera.” I think, alright, bit of a break from this. Then they say, “Steve’s got a car, let’s all jump in.” Even the girl is up for it, which I think is great. So I’m back in the car with her, a chance to reassert myself. Although of course, the guy she seemed into jumps in too, which was a bit of a blow.

They start directing me. Left here, right there. Then suddenly, “Just drive into that field.” It’s pitch black, and I’m thinking, hang on, this is my parents’ car. But I don’t want to seem like I’m being a nerd or too cautious in front of the girl, so I do it. I drive the car into the field.

They all jump out and run off into the darkness yelling “Vera, Vera, Vera.” I’m just sat there in the car, with Billy Ocean on, alone in a field, wondering what’s going on. Then out of the darkness they come back with a Vietnamese pot-bellied pig they’ve stolen from a nearby farm.

Apparently, they knew the pig was called Vera because someone knew the farmer. They’re all shouting, “Put her in the back, take her back to the party, it’ll be hilarious.” I’m thinking, do I really want a pig in the back of the car? But again, I don’t want to be the boring one, so in she goes. Pig squealing in the boot, friends all laughing.

Then they say, “Stop again, let’s do some cow tipping.” That old myth that cows sleep standing up so you can push them over. So they’re off running around trying to tip cows over while I’m sat in the car with the pig, in the middle of nowhere.

Eventually we get to a dead end and they say, “Turn around, let’s head back.” I try to do a three-point turn, but the road’s too narrow and I end up wedging the Volvo estate sideways across the lane. Completely stuck. I can’t figure it out, I’m panicking. There’s a stolen pig in the car, I’m blocking a country road, I’m imagining angry farmers with shotguns, people off their heads at the party, everything going wrong.

I honestly thought they were going to have to send a helicopter to lower a giant magnet onto the car and lift it out.

And that’s when I just started crying. Just a bit, gently. I’m sat in the back of the car, tears coming, while the other guy, the one the girl fancied, gets into the driver’s seat and starts sorting it out. Just slowly edging the car back and forth, calmly turning it around.

Me, in the back, gently weeping. Billy Ocean still playing. Pig squealing. Absolute disaster."

1mbqk7t,I have raised a claim through section 75 for the used car I recently bought,"Hi all,

I recently bought a bmw 1 series 2 months ago, first week I already noticed issue with the car’s coolant, then there was a misfire, so sparkplugs was replaced by the seller. 

I thought everything was fine so I just topped up the coolant. After a week of repair my car almost overheated, and the coolant was gone trader picked up the car the same day and replaced the waterpump and AC.

They then dropped it home, and told me everything has been fixed. He asked me to pay £250, and I said i’ll pay it if i know the car won’t have same issues again, but i can’t decide now cause i’m going on holiday for 2 weeks. Fast forward, had my holiday, and still noticing the coolant issues, almost finished the 5 litre coolant as I keep topping it up.

I have now started hearing knocking noises yesterday and had enough with the issue so I went to local garage to diagnose it and they advised a radiator replacement.

I messaged the trader about the replacement and told me to go fix it myself. I refused and told him i’m returning the car, he told me to go to the police and he blocked me straightaway. 

So, since this issue is already raised to my credit card company today, I was wondering if I can still get this radiator replaced for now while I wait for the claim to go through as I have no means of transport to my workplace? And seller is not responding? Will the bank cover the cost of the repair?

If you get back into PCP then you're basically signing up for perpetually paying for cars.

Unless the mileage is mental, just buy the current one out and keep it serviced at the dealer. The warranty will be extended up until it's ten years old.

Put your monthly PCP figure into a calculator and multiply it by 84 months. Subtract the balloon payment from that number and you're left with the amount by which PCP is ripping you off for the period the car is in warranty, less service costs and tyres etc.

1mbhuqm,2nd Gen CRV needs to move on to the next life...,"... but what's next?  
I really like our 2nd Gen CRV, but it's getting to the age, millage and underbody corrosion point of it's life when it's not really sensible to keep ploughing cash into. 24MPG and £400+ a year to tax it is also... painful.

As much as SUV's are derrided, my wife has a disability and getting in and out of a taller car is a lot easier for her. AWD / 4WD desirable, but not a deal breaker - we live rurally and above the snow line, but what with warmer winters now, having AWD for snowed up country lanes isn't as much as a concern as it was a decade ago. Ideally about the same size, could go a bit smaller. Ideally diesel for the fuel effiency. Idealy something easier on the tax front as well.

Curb appeal and 0-60 utterly unimportant. Decent load space, effiencent and reliable is what I'm looking for here! I really like the idea of a Panda 4x4 but think they're just a bit too small for our needs, although with a roof rack it might be OK?

1mbfcjq,Analysis of the Smax if remap or not,"Analysis Summary - 2007 Ford S-Max 2.0 TDCi (212,000+ miles)

After reviewing real-world performance data, sensor logs, and driving behavior, we conclude the vehicle has likely undergone a mild Stage 1 remap.

Performance Indicators:

- Boost pressure peaked at 20-21 PSI in 6th gear and held 18-19 PSI in 3rd-4th gear (stock is ~14.5-16 PSI).

- MAF readings peaked over 135-140 g/s, indicating increased air intake.

- Fuel rail pressure reached up to 22,426 PSI during full throttle.

- Throttle load and pedal position consistently hit 99-100%, confirming wide-open throttle runs.

- Vehicle accelerated strongly from 74 to 135+ km/h in 4th gear and reached over 150 km/h in 6th.

- Turbo whistle and surge consistent with tuned diesel behavior.

DPF & EGR Observations:
- DPF differential pressure sensor remained constant at ~16.6 PSI regardless of engine load.

- EGR throttle valve voltage stayed fixed at 5.00V (should fluctuate with RPM/load).

- No DTCs for DPF, only EGR-related code with no limp mode or warning light.

- Suggests EGR and DPF are disabled or mapped out in the ECU.

Estimated Output:

- Horsepower: ~160-165 HP
- Torque: Estimated 360-380 Nm

Conclusion:

These values and behaviors are consistent with a mild Stage 1 remap. The boost levels, airflow data, fuel delivery, and inactive emissions systems point to ECU tuning focused on better drivability and torque. While subtle, the car performs stronger than a stock unit of this age and mileage.",5,1753707177.0,2,CartalkUK,1753820013,2025-07-28 12:52:57,2025-07-29 20:13:33,"Negative_Link_277 (Score: 5): Put it on a dyno, its the only way to know for sure."

In terms of charging time from empty, typically you won't charge from empty to begin with, nor should you rapid-charge it to 100% - you shouldn't really run your car down to 0%, and if you drop below 20% the car will start offering to find charging stations for you. You'll get the best charging performance between 10-80% state of charge.

Charging from 10-80% on a 200kW charger (the max speed the Polestar 4 can support) will take around 25 minutes, on a 50kW charger you're looking at more like an hour. You should never need to book ahead for a public charger, except if your destination (e.g. a hotel) has chargers that they book out to their guests - but that's specific to your circumstances.

When it comes to saving money, Tesla Superchargers are often the cheapest option, but not all are open to every EV - if you download the app it'll show you what chargers are open to non-Teslas. If you prefer to avoid Superchargers and have Octopus Energy supply at your house I would recommend downloading Octopus Electroverse, you can save some money that way too (and you can add the cost of the charging session to your electricity bill, which makes payment really convenient).

Happy to answer any further questions you might have in the replies. r/ElectricVehiclesUK, the Polestar 4 UK Facebook group, and the Polestar Drivers Club Facebook groups are all helpful places to be if you have questions about EV ownership in the UK, or about the Polestar 4 specifically :)

1mbasgo,Car stolen by dealer - advice needed,"I’ve given my car to a dealer to sell. I don’t live permanently in the UK at the moment but have been in touch with his on a regular basis to get some updates. As far as I was aware, the car hasn’t been sold.

txe4 (Score: 18): I agree with the other commenters about the issues and the Aygo/C1/107.

Your problem here is that you're at the absolute bottom of the market and with only £2k you're going to struggle to find a car that isn't fucked. Autos always command a premium and - while people can and do get lucky - £3k is table stakes for a car that isn't fucked in most places.

Check out insurance costs first because with so little to spend, insurance cost might be large relative to the cost of the car here.

Appreciate you're struggling for cash here but an maniacal obsession with fuel economy doesn't necessarily lead to lowest overall cost if you're not doing a lot of miles. One repair can wipe out years of fuel savings.

You could always ask the question through email or over the chat system. Just say that you're after clarification. Then you're in the clear. 


I probably wouldn't bother. It's not a change that affects the performance or value of the car so they likely don't really care.
