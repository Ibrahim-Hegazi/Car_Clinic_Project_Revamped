It worked fine, but i just could not move. I could still press on the gas (i dont rrmember it making a noise or not, i was in full panic mode) and the brake but the car wouldn't budge. It does have a tendency to jerk when my speed reaches around 20mph but other than that, i havent had issues.

I dont recall any check engine lights on or anything. I could not pull over either and i signaled for everyone to go past me (which NJ drivers did so, but were NOT nice about it). After fussing around, it worked again (i think i turned the car off and on and it finally worked again).

1mbtdi4,Seeking Advice,"Hello all!

TLDR: At a crossroads for keeping 84k '04 Impala in and out of shop or getting something newer and more reliable. Need reliable vehicle for hour NE US commute but want to make sound financial decision. Thank you!

This past August (2024), I got an '04 Impala 3.4L with 70k on it. Since then, it has been in the shop 5 times. There was a fluid leak, serpentine belt replacement, ignition cable replacement, sway bar replacement (2 weeks ago), and now my car is in the shop one week into my new job. I recently moved to the northeast and have an hour commute so need something reliable.

The impala now has 84k on it, and part of me thinks if I used it as a beater it could last a while. Another part of me thinks getting something new(er) or new and more reliable would be a better investment. Still, I would need something that could endure the wear and tear of bumper to bumper stop and go traffic without beating it into submission.

I am trying to make the best financial decision above all. Getting a brand new car scares me because I have never undertook such a large financial ""burden"", depreciation, and so on. Mainly looking 2015 and newer Mazda, Honda, and Toyota, or certified used.

What I’d love some guidance on is:

I accidentally had my old work company’s corporate rate code in my account/attached to this reservation. It had the damage waiver included. When Enterprise saw this, they pinged me and alerted me. I told them I switched jobs last month, and completely forgot the rate was on it (I made this car reservation back in February).

Please note: the scratch was entirely cosmetic, just large. The car drives perfectly, the door works perfectly, no damage to the foot step on the car, etc…

Therefore, given the corporate rate was not valid, neither is the damage waiver - massive fuck up on my part.

Based on other reddit discussions, I immediately reached out to Progressive, with whom we have our personal vehicle auto insurance.

Then it started happening a little bit more often than usual. and then after a few weeks the check engine light would occasionally turn on then the next time we started the car it would be off again. Then last weekend we drove from Tacoma to Bellingham and on the way back home there was bumper to bumper traffic on SB-I-5 and the car started doing the ""ka'plunk"" thing just about every time we came to a stop, as it was a slow stop-n-go for a good mile (at the least). And then it was shortly accompanied by the ""check engine light"" again throughout the rest of the trip home back to Tacoma. But then after a few hours after we made it home I had to go to the store and noticed the check engine light wasn't on anymore and the ""ka-plunk thing didn't happen at all on the way there and then back from the store. I was told by someone at O'Reilly's, that did a diagnostics test on it, that it was a transmission sensor code. But that was all the info I got. Which really doesn't help. Since I am a woman that knows nothing about cars, he probably figured it was useless to clue me in on the code number that came up. And I am not made of money nor do I have any extra saved, since times have been difficult living on a fixed income. So if anyone out there knows what this issue might be, have any tips that will help or that can give any guidance as to where I can find a reliable & decently priced mechanic (that won't rip me off) I'm all ears.

1mbvyrt,Head bolt thread repair,"Hello everyone,

My friend's car overheated due to a broken radiator, which caused the head gasket to fail. The car isn't worth much, so taking it to a repair shop didn’t make sense financially. We decided to try fixing it ourselves, and everything went pretty smoothly—until it was time to tighten the head bolts.

Three of the bolt holes have damaged threads, and the head bolts won’t tighten properly. The original bolts are M11x1.5 and about 160 mm long (with roughly 70 mm of thread). Now we’re trying to figure out the best way to fix the damaged threads.

From what I understand, the original threads need to be drilled out, and then we need to tap new, larger threads. But you can’t just tap M12 into an M11 hole, right? So we’d have to go up to M13. The problem is that M13 bolts are very hard to find, while M12, M14, M15, and M16 are much more common.

That raises a few concerns:

Should we drill and tap for M14 instead, just to make bolts easier to source?

The larger the hole we drill, the more off-center the result might be. Is this a real issue when it comes to head bolts?

Could drilling larger holes weaken the cylinder head/block?


Our original idea was to use Helicoils or Time-Serts, but those seem to be limited to just a few centimeters in length, and the original thread depth is much longer than that. If a long enough insert existed, we could have just tapped M13 and used M12 bolts, which are easy to find.

Since the car is not worth much, we feel it’s worth trying some kind of fix. If it works—great. If not, then it’s not a big loss.

If anyone has experience with this kind of thread repair (especially on head bolts), we’d really appreciate any advice or alternative ideas we might not have thought of.

Pro-tip: If you see your tool doing a Service 27 Seed/Key to unlock the module, try omitting that. Most BCM stuff on these cars won't need a security unlock, but some tools just do it every time regardless."
1mbjwzp,Connecting to can bus of 2008 Mercedes W204,"Hi everyone,

I'm trying to connect with canbus of my vehicle but despite trying several devices I just cant get any data. I tried Arduino nano with MCP2515 with canhacker, and Fysetc UCAN with kangaroo, but none of them are getting any frames. I connected to drivers side junction box to twisted brown/brown red wires. When I try to connect with enabled transmiting, the devices connected to that can bus can't connect (I'm getting all sorts of errors on dashboard). If I enable ""listen only"" mode, all systems are working. In both cases I dont receive any data. Tried with termination and without, switched places of H and L, changed bus speed, but still nothing shows on monitor. Is there something I forget? Someone here connected successfully to w204 or w212? Maybe I should try to connect to canbus somewhere else? I'd be gratefull for any tips :)",1,1753717977.0,2,CarHacking,1753812612,2025-07-28 15:52:57,2025-07-29 18:10:12,Remarkable_Wind1397 (Score: 2): Is your Arduino connected to the car's power and ground? Also measure the resistance across the bus with and without your device connected.

It will vary from simply adding an additional null byte to generating the rest.
