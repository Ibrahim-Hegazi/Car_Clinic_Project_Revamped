Have someone press the clutch pedal... cover the hose with your thumb, release the clutch pedal, release your thumb... repeat.

1n10u8e,Is this normal engine sound?,"https://reddit.com/link/1n10u8e/video/gby8jk0k2glf1/player

Hi everyone,

I hope everyone is doing well. I currently have a 2008 Renault M√©gane MK2 RS DCI (the engine is a 2.0 DCI, specifically the M9R-724). It has c. 55,000 KM on it (c. 34,000 miles) and I was wondering if this engine sound sounds normal to everyone. I'm not sure if I'm being paranoid but I feel like there's a whine on the background that seems to slowly go away as the engine warms up. The oil (and oil / air filters) is 3,000 km old and is changed regularly without fault.

PS: I am not referring to the sound of the turbo that you can hear spooling at c. 0:32 but rather to the overall engine sound/whining.

PS2: The correct oil viscosity is used as per the OEM's recommendations. I only use 5W40 and tried multiple brands (namely Castrol Edge, Motul Xcess 8100 etc) but all seem to make the same noise when cold.

PS3: My brother has a Renault Laguna MK3 (Engine: F4RT) and it does make a similar (albeit deeper) sound when cold, but I'm just trying to make sure nothing's wrong..

1n10p4z,Are these all symptoms of a EVAP Purge Valve stuck open?,"2009 Honda Element LX AT AWD 
159k mi, bought 5 months ago w/ 152k

I have been dealing with several issues, some of which I worried were transmission related, but that I now think may all be caused by the evap purge valve being stuck open? Does this make sense? Is there anything else that could cause all of these symptoms?

-Maybe 3.5 months ago the engine began, once in a while, stuttering or hesitating a lil bit when accelerating from a stop. No issue if you accelerate a little slower than normal.

-About 2 months ago there was a few times when I got out of the car after driving and smelled gasoline. Each time it was right after filling up (not overfilling) the tank. I don't think I ever filled it all the way previous to the smell, and I haven't filled it since. Smell has been absent until driving down a mountain the other day when I think I smelled it again. (And possibly a burning rubber smell for a few minutes)

-In the last week or two I feel like the RPMs are too high before shifting under medium/heavy acceleration. The engine sounds louder than normal but it's hard to tell. Idle is generally steady at 700-715, cruising RPM seems normal.

-ive been hearing a 'squeaky belt' noise only on the highway and when exiting the highway, and also when driving down a steep hill. Now I think maybe it's the sound of the vacuum leak caused by the purge valve?

Yesterday I plugged in my VEEPEAK ELM327 scanner. No codes, but: Short term and long term fuel trim are low, yesterday long term read -9% and now today it reads -17%. Commanded evap purge is 40-50% at idle and gets higher when driving, up to 100%. Air intake take is high @ 150¬∞f. Absolute intake manifold pressure 3.6 psi. Oxygen sensor voltage bank 1 sensor 2 fluctuating between 0.2 and 0.8 when I think it's supposed to be stable?

-Gas mileage has always seemed significantly lower than it should be but I havent ever kept close track. It's 105-110¬∞f here so the a/c is always cranking which makes it hard to say.

Also last month I had to replace my starter, which could be unrelated, or could be from extra stress due to evap purge valve making the engine harder to start? Possible corroborating evidence.


How likely is it that it's all caused by the evap purge valve, and is that possible while still having a good idle? Are those okay throttle and pedal position readings for idling? Is 3% Relative Throttle Position also a symptom of a purge valve vacuum leak?

If turning the wheel a few times makes it leak more, it probably is the power steering.  It's a simple system with a pump, reservoir, and 2 hoses that supply and return fluid to the steering rack, and a leak can appear anywhere in the system.

The thing to do now is check the fluid levels.  The coolant and power steering can be checked just by looking at the fill lines/gauge on the reservoirs.  The transmission fluid level has to be checked when the transmission is warm and the engine is running.  YouTube will have videos on how to check those fluids for your model year.

The system that's low is the one with the leak.  You might be able to drive it to a shop if it's a little low, depending on which one is low, and the distance, but it's best to top up the levels before driving it."

 DO NOT USE STEEL PISTONS..

  the Phenolic pistons block heat from braking from getting to the brake fluid in the caliper and boiling it.. creating bubbles in the brake caliper that reduce braking force to almost zero..

 years ago.. one F350 owner replaced his calipers with steel piston calipers.. had his bobcat on the trailer. going down a steep hill.. overheated the brakes.. lost the brakes and crashed into several cars at the bottom.. 

 replace both your front calipers with reman units with Phenolic pistons please.. 

 also check your brake rotor surfaces for wear.. if you have a ridge around the outside the rotor is worn..  needs machining or a replacement.. 

 why does this matter.  putting new pads on a worn rotor that the wear is tapered as it usually is... causes the new parallel brake pads to be pushed by the parallel brake caliper and pistons against a tapered rotor. instead of even pressure on the pads.. the pistons have too much pressure on one side.  causing them to crack like you have..
 
 you also have reduced brake pad friction surface touching the brake rotor face do to the angles.. so you get spongy brakes and reduced braking...

  Yep. brake rotors are expensive.. replacement trucks are even more expensive when you have reduced braking and can't stop fast enough to prevent running into the current crop of drivers who learned to drive on a video game.. 

 brakes are a wear item. things need to be changed and properly done.. with new rotors .. you can probably do 1 pad swap till the rotors need to be changed again without braking effects. if the rotors have a big ridge.. you will have spongy brakes.. the ridge is not created by the brake pads pushing cast iron around. the ridge is what is left because the rotor surface was worn away that much.

  rebuilding brake calipers is not hard.  

 see if you can get the replacement pistons.. caliper kits. a bottle of Brake assembly lube  really helps.

 lots of brake cleaner..  then flush with some actual brake fluid.. then the seals installed the dust boots.. brake assembly lube the inside of the bore and the seals..  the brake bleeder screw is removed.. some compressed air into the brake hose hole while you gently hold the piston over the dust seals. getting it to seal around the base of the piston till it inflates and slides up the piston, then you can stop the air and slide the piston into the bore past the square cut seal..  clamp that in with a C Clamp and do the other piston."

1n0zcd6,No headlights/brights - low relay trigger voltage (?),"Hey ya'll! I got a 2013 fiesta S that's not turning on headlights. Here's a list of things I've currently done:

-Change/swap relays

-Change/swap fuses

-Test fuses/relays independent of vehicle

-Test and bypass dash switch

-rework grounds to battery/ECM/etc.

-change battery (I've been meaning to change it before the season changes, it was a 2017)

-Test alternator by removing battery while running and unplugging PWM

The only thing that has ""worked"" thus far is using a bypass wire to bridge 80/37 on the relay panel. I noticed when measuring the voltage from the trigger side, 85/86, when I hit the switches the highest voltage I get on both headlights and brights is 2.5v, which seems too low to trigger the relay into operating.

I did have this serviced a while back for the engine fuse box needing to be redone for corrosion in my state (MI) that they covered as part of a safety bulletin, but it's been working fine up until now.

*Vauxhall Corsa D - 2014 - 1.2 Petrol Engine*

I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs actually a weird noise or it‚Äôs just me, but there are 2 sets of noises I‚Äôm hearing from the engine:

1. First half of the video - it sounds like a wet slap (I know, but it‚Äôs the best way to describe it). The noise becomes more noticeable near the engine cover. I can also hear that noise speed up (and more clearly) when I‚Äôm accelerating (particularly at high speed and low revs, likely because the engine is quieter so not being masked). This leads me to believe it might be the auxiliary belt. Perhaps it‚Äôs not taut enough or something? 

2. Second half of video - there‚Äôs a continuous tapping noise. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the timing chain because from the videos I‚Äôve seen, those sound a lot louder than this. I‚Äôm unsure if this is the normal sound of the Corsa engine, but could use some help with it if someone has had previous experience with it.

1n0ut66,Weird electrical issue on 2010 Lancer: Alternator stops charging after moving + blower delay + CAN bus faults,"I‚Äôm having a mix of blower motor, alternator voltage, and CAN bus fault issues on my 2010 Mitsubishi Lancer (engine/trans swapped from a 2017). I‚Äôm trying to figure out if they‚Äôre related or separate problems:

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Symptoms
	‚Ä¢	Blower Motor Delay ‚Üí About 70% of the time, my HVAC blower doesn‚Äôt start right away when I turn the car on.
	‚Ä¢	To get it working, I set the fan to max and drive for a bit before it kicks in.
	‚Ä¢	Tapping the blower motor under the dash instantly fixes it, so I know the motor itself is fine.
	‚Ä¢	Alternator / Voltage Issues ‚Üí My charging voltage behaves strangely:
	‚Ä¢	12.5 V ‚Äî engine off
	‚Ä¢	12.2 V ‚Äî car on, engine off
	‚Ä¢	14.3 V ‚Äî engine on, idling
	‚Ä¢	But the second I move forward (even half a meter), voltage drops to ~12 V and stays there for the whole drive.
	‚Ä¢	Weirdly, if I turn on my headlights, voltage goes up to ~13.5 V.
	‚Ä¢	On rare occasions (maybe once or twice a month), the voltage jumps to ~13.9 V randomly ‚Äî feels like the alternator ‚Äúkicks in‚Äù at random.
	‚Ä¢	Diagnostic Trouble Codes ‚Üí My OBD scan shows several CAN bus and ETACS-related codes:
	‚Ä¢	U0100 ‚Äî Lost communication with ECM/PCM
	‚Ä¢	U0001 ‚Äî High-speed CAN communication bus
	‚Ä¢	Multiple manufacturer-defined codes (C1290, C1941, C1931, C1921, C1911, P1590)

What I‚Äôve Done So Far
	‚Ä¢	Tested the battery and alternator with a multimeter ‚Üí numbers are normal until I drive forward.
	‚Ä¢	Quick-lane shop tested alternator a few months ago ‚Üí said ‚Äúhealthy,‚Äù but ig they never tested after driving forward/backward
	‚Ä¢	OBD live data matches my multimeter readings ‚Üí so it‚Äôs not just a sensor glitch.
	‚Ä¢	Tapping the blower instantly works ‚Üí leaning toward a relay or connection issue, but not sure if it‚Äôs related to the alternator/CAN faults.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Questions
	1.	Could a bad alternator control signal or ETACS issue explain why charging stops after moving forward?
	2.	Could the CAN bus / ETACS faults be tied to both the alternator and blower issues?
	3.	Should I start by checking the blower relay, ETACS connectors, alternator wiring, or the CAN harness?
	4.	Is this something only a Mitsubishi dealer can diagnose properly, or would a good independent shop be fine?

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

TL;DR:
Blower motor sometimes won‚Äôt turn on until I tap it or drive for a bit, my alternator charges at 14.3 V at idle but drops to ~12 V the moment I move the car, and I‚Äôve got multiple CAN bus / ETACS-related fault codes.

1n09ic9,My Porsche coolant reservoir apparently has oil in it,"A message popped up on my dashboard this morning that said: ‚ÄúTop up coolant immediately, do not drive.‚Äù It disappeared a few seconds later but I took my car to the Porsche dealership because of this warning, just to be safe and that‚Äôs when they discovered there was oil in my coolant reservoir.

I‚Äôm not sure how the oil got there. I‚Äôve only had oil top-offs done at the Porsche dealership and got one done about a week ago. The dealership checked their camera footage and confirmed they added the oil in the right place, so it wasn‚Äôt them.

There are no symptoms right now ‚Äî no milky coolant, no overheating, no unusual smells, nothing abnormal. The oil seems to be just sitting on top of the coolant. The warning massage is no longer there and only stayed on my dashboard for 10 seconds after I started my car this morning.

I had another oil top off done at a Porsche dealership just another location beginning of June but I‚Äôm assuming they‚Äôd know where to add the oil and that was a while ago. I would assume if they did put it in the cooler reservoir, after such a long time there would be some signs. 

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? What should I do? I drive a lot and have noticed no symptoms and there are no warning signs on my dashboard. Does the system still need a full flush even if the oil hasn‚Äôt circulated yet? And how urgent is it to get this fixed before driving more

Chrysler 3.6L has an oil filter housing that also has coolant running through it and when they fail they can dump oil into the cooling system. It‚Äôs a nightmare to flush the oil out because the system contaminates so quickly and your heater core behind the dash also needs to be flushed otherwise you‚Äôll have poor or no heat in the winter.

If your cooling system is allowing oil and coolant to mix it‚Äôs not far from a catastrophic failure. This needs a proper diagnosis.

1n09cuz,The ONE that got away,"Hi,

I had a 1998 4Runner that was the ONE car.   The very second I saw it for sale I knew it was mine.  We fit together just perfectly.  Nothing and nobody ever brought me more happiness or in the moment joy than that vehicle.  Just looking at it made me smile.  Just sitting in it made me feel better.

The sound of the engine was its own special magic to me. With the right music I swear my heart would beat to the rhythm.

Our lyrics were from I Was Made For Lovin' You. If I had a bad day or a rough time I'd go for a drive and all was well in the world.   I could have driven it blind folded if you know what I mean???  She was a part of me.  She was always there waiting for me.

I was looking forward to growing old with that vehicle.  Fate had other plans, and it took my BFF away from me.  I swear it was like a best friend dying.  I did everything I could to keep us together right until the very end and grieved when I had to leave it behind.  Looking at pictures of it just cuts me to the quick.

I miss my 1998.  It was one of a kind specially made by a Toyota master technician.  I literally said the second I saw her...she was made for me.  Low kms and no rust.  There will never be another.  My heart is broken, and the driveway is empty.

**Did you ever have a vehicle like this? Any make or model...cheap or expensive.  Tell me your story...did you find true love again?  Did you ever find that feeling again?**

Sure there are other vehicles...but they are not my 1998 4Runner...

We have a $250 deductible, and the total price of repairs is over $3,700. All this time we thought we would just go to the shop and hand them 250 bucks and leave with the car and everything else is between the shop and the warranty company. Is that it? Please tell me that's it. Or are we expected to pay the full amount ourselves and then the warranty people send a reimbursement check to us later?

Please read carefully and answer.,"What should you do if brand new TTY head bolts stretch beyond their yield point and reach their plastic phase earlier than what the manufacturer recommends (at 250 degrees instead of the recommended 300)? Will they snap if more torque is applied next?

Imagine you have to torque your head bolts to 300 degrees (20 NM + 300 degrees) in 3 stages (100 + 100 + 100). You complete the first 2 stages successfully and have already tightened them all to 200 degrees. You are about to do the final step. You start tightening them another 100 degrees but **suddenly one of the bolts seems to get stuck at 250 or 260 degrees and doesn't want to turn any further.**

My question is what do you do if such thing happens? Do you apply more torque to your breaker bar and try to turn it another 40 or 50 degrees to reach the recommended 300 degrees? Isn't there the risk of snapping the bolt if more torque is applied?

What if you forget about the last 50 degrees and tighten the other bolts to 250 degrees to distribute the torque evenly? (It is not a good idea to tighten one bolt to 250 and the others to 300)

1n0o06w,Advice needed based on salvage titles,"
My uncle found a 2013 Hyundai Elantra with 89,000 miles on Facebook listed for $1,600. At first, it seemed like a total red flag. Nobody would sell a car like that for so cheap unless something was seriously wrong. It turns out the car has a salvage title, which he hadn‚Äôt mentioned. The seller did disclose it on Facebook, but my uncle didn‚Äôt notice because he can‚Äôt read well. We went to see the car, and some issues popped up right away. The battery was dead, so we had to jump-start it. There was a strange hissing sound from underneath the car. The seller fiddled with something to make it stop, but it was concerning. The seller told my uncle that because it‚Äôs a salvage title, he‚Äôd need to get a rebuilt title before the DMV will issue plates. This isn‚Äôt a normal inspection. The car must pass a special salvage/rebuilt inspection, which ensures the car is roadworthy and that no stolen parts were used. Even if the engine is perfect, any safety issues or unverified parts could prevent registration.

The seller said my uncle could bring a mechanic to check it on-site, but that has limits because its not in a shop. A street side mechanic can look at the engine and general condition, but they cannot detect hidden frame damage, suspension issues, wiring problems, rust, or verify stolen parts, all of which the DMV checks during the official salvage inspection. This is different from having a good title because you can fix minor issues whenever you have the chance. But not with a salvage title. Unless you park the car and not use it until the issues are fixed. So here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm stuck. The car is cheap, but the rebuilt process is complicated and costly with inspection fees, potential repairs, multiple trips if it fails, and limited insurance options. A mechanic could give it a thumbs-up on-site, but that does not guarantee it will pass the salvage inspection or be safe long-term. have you ever dealt with buying a salvage-title car in NYC? Would you risk it for a $1,600 car knowing there could be hidden problems and extra fees before it‚Äôs road-legal? Or is it smarter to just save up for a clean-title car? He honestly doesn‚Äôt listen and i told him to avoid it.

Basically, my niece took her car to a shop to get the control arms replaced. He took approximately 2 months to do the repair. The car was (and still is) making a clunking sound, like something was loose. Sounds suspension related to me. After he replaced them, the car still has the same sound. She asked me to take a look at it, and after noticing some minor things done wrong or missing, I noticed the bracket that holds on of the lower control arms in place had some torch marks. When I inspected further, I notice this. Looks like dude torched into the bracket. I'm guessing he couldn't get the bolt out otherwise, or maybe was just trying to do it the lazy way. I've never dealt with welding a car frame, so I'm just curious if this is something I can weld, or should I have my niece file an insurance claim instead? I can weld it myself.

MarkVII88 (Score: 2): Here's some inexpensive options:  

1. You can drain the fluid from the pan, and replace with fresh. This will replace about 3.5 quarts of the 8-9 quarts in the system. You could do this at each of the next 3-4 oil changes over the next 15-20K miles.  

2. You can perform 3 transmission drain-and-fills (3.5 quarts) in quick succession, driving the car for several miles in between each drain and fill. This will mix new fluid with old fluid, but will ultimately replace a significant amount of transmission fluid in a very gentle way.

3. You could effectively flush the transmission without taking it to a shop by following this process. This is much gentler on the transmission than using a pressurized machine in a shop to force fluid through. The transmission itself is the pump.

* Drain the pan and replace with fresh fluid (3.5 quarts).
* Hook up a 3/8 hose from the outflow of the OEM trans cooler into a gallon jug
* Turn on the car, put it in Drive, while holding foot on the brake, to pump fluid through the transmission
* Let the car idle in Drive, fill the gallon jug up to about 3 quarts, then put the car in Park, and turn off.
* Fill the pan with 3 quarts of fresh fluid, and run the hose into a fresh gallon jug 
* Turn on the car, put it in Drive, while holding foot on the brake, to pump fluid through the transmission.
* Let the car idle in Drive, fill the gallon jug up to about 3 quarts, or when you start seeing new, fresh transmission fluid being pumped into the gallon jug, then put the car in Park and turn off.
* Reconnect the OEM trans cooler lines, start the car, run through D/N/R/P and check the fluid level when idling in Park. Top off as needed. You will have replaced about 9 quarts of fresh fluid in about 30 minutes with this process."

They ran the codes saying that the fuel was running lean, gave everything a look, said that it was probably fine to take on the road trip and that they weren't sure that anything was even actually wrong with it or if it was just a sensor problem.

So the car comes home and the light is back on and it's making a ""noise"", I bring it back to the mechanic, and they replace the fuel pump. That's why the car is running lean. There's a problem with a fuel pump. Okay, makes sense.

But then the code comes back on again like a week later and it's still running lean. So they replace the EGR pipe, which was ""practically falling apart"". I was going to get my panties in a twist about this since they clearly didn't notice anything wrong with this part in the first and second inspections, and it kind of felt like they just replaced the fuel pump with no cause if another part was the problem and ""practically falling apart"". But they offered to waive labor and just replace the part so I didn't feel like arguing the point when it felt like they were already taking some responsibility for what looked like a mistake.

Now about 3 weeks later the check engine light comes on again with a code regarding the purge valve p0441, p0455. And I know that part can also potentially cause a car to run lean, the original issue my mechanic was, near as I could tell, having a helluva time trying to diagnose. 

My question is. If the next move is to replace my purge valve. How should I proceed dealing with this mechanic? How likely is it that a whole series of fuel line related parts are all falling apart at once, vs them just charging me labor and parts to just replace every part of it one at a time without properly diagnosing anything? 

The fact that within 3 weeks they went from ""you can take this on a road trip"" to ""yeah this piece was basically falling apart"" feels kind of ridiculous to me. Especially when they charged a diagnostic fee, it wasn't like a free glance over or anything. Should I see a new mechanic? Should I contest any of these charges? Ask for comped service? Or just grit my teeth and eat the costs because this just happens sometimes?

Anyways if it was off timing and you hand rolled the engine you would likely encounter a valve clearance issue where you wouldn‚Äôt be able to turn the engine.

1n0dxuo,Transmission trouble in a VW T4 automatic. Trying to figure out the best way to go.,"Australia. Bought it at 88,000 kms for a road trip & van living. Seemed good for the first 500 kms, then blew its alternator and its been a constant stream of problems since, convincing me to never buy a Euro car again unless it's high-end luxury and then I know what I'm getting into. Now with Volkswagen I believe you pay the price of a luxury car through repairs and parts without actually having the prestige of a luxury. With that out of the way, the current issue is the hardest to decide...

Minor transmission problems at the moment. It's got a whirring sound which changes in pitch along with acceleration. It shifts easily into 2nd from 1st, takes a noticeable while to get into 3rd and again to get into 4th. When it does go into 4th it does so in a few falls on the tachometer, rather than instantly. However it doesn't jump when changing gears from what I can see. It just takes a damn long time to. However the revs do seem to correlate with acceleration - but rather sluggish.

Took it to mechanic and they're saying the torque converter is worn, which another mechanic and ChatGPT have both suggested. 

They're charging $3,000 to do the torque converter alone, but warned that the transmission probably has issues due to the torque converter going out and recommended changing the whole transmission. Secondhand gearbox & TC would be $6-8K. 

Another shop which specialises in Volkswagen outright said VW automatics are generally trash especially from that time, they'll only recommend VW manuals and said they'd be willing to do a manual rebuild for $7,000. From what I know now if buying a non-Japanese car I'll only buy manuals, but got to work with what I know and have now. 

I'm in Cairns QLD. A bit strapped for options because not many shops want to or have the skills to work on my van, and the ones that do will likely charge more than they ought to for the task. 

Given that the transmission's problems currently seem minor, should I keep driving it until the transmission goes, then install a new secondhand one? Should I do it now? Should I do the manual conversion now? Any other options I haven't considered? 

Thanks.",1,1756187831.0,4,AskMechanics,1756323237,2025-08-26 05:57:11,2025-08-27 19:33:57,"Answulf (Score: 2): Honestly, if it‚Äôs still driving okay, I‚Äôd keep using it for now and save your money - just know it could let go suddenly.

Otherwise, drive it till it dies and then decide if it‚Äôs worth fixing or just moving on. You could also check VW wreckers in Brisbane or Sydney, they might have a reconditioned gearbox that could save you a few thousand.    
  
If your van life isn't set in stone, probably smartest to sell it now before a total transmission failure.

1n0dq2d,Transmission or Fuel?,"Sorry for the long post, trying to be thorough. 

I have a 95 Dodge Dakota SLT 5.2 46RH Automatic Transmission with 201k miles on it. Owned it since 2002 and until now it's always been reliable in the power delivery department. 

When traveling at any speeds, but most noticeable at 45+ the engine will stutter when slamming the gas pedal down in attempts to pass traffic.

 I have slow shifted through all gears, all 3 are there, overdrive pump reacts when the button is on/off, and fluid is at the proper level when checked in neutral. I'm not too familiar with the purpose of the kickdown band, but I was going to adjust that when I have the chance. I understand that 4th gear is electronic but I don't know how to adjust it. I'm also going to check the throttle cable and tighten it if necessary. 

I know that if I put it in neutral it will rev just fine. I'm sure this is unrelated but when I attempted to start it this evening, the fuel pump wouldn't respond. I cleaned the contacts on the relay and it eventually fired up. 

So could the fuel pump be failing and that domino effecting the rest of the system or could the transmission bands need adjusted and the fuel pump is a separate issue?",1,1756187015.0,5,AskMechanics,1756323237,2025-08-26 05:43:35,2025-08-27 19:33:57,"Answulf (Score: 2): Sounds more like fuel delivery than the transmission. At 201k the pump could be weak, especially since you already had to mess with the relay to get it to run. A bad pump or clogged filter will cause that stutter under load.

When I got it, the wire harness was crushed and in my haste, decided to hardwire the blower using crimp connectors. The alternative was sending it back and waiting another 2 weeks for a new one. It worked fine and never blew a fuse. 

The my compressor pulley froze up and I ended up having to replace that, as well. Decided to go ahead and replace the Condenser, Dryer, and Orifice tube as well. Vacuumed, recharged freon levels, good to go. Well, it's been about 2 weeks since the AC has been running as it should,  as then the blower starts to ""make weird noises"" (according to the wife) and then started to intermittently stop. 

The symptoms made me think it was a short in my hardwire, assuming that if anything were the problem it would be that. I wiggled the wire and the blower started blowing fine for a few days. Then it started going out when I would hit a hard enough bump. Then, it stopped working altogether. I noted that my AC was still working cuz the compartment would sweat.

Now, before I do anything else, I'm gonna ask for advice and see if anybody else has experienced something like this and where I should look next.

1n08lua,2011 Forester Intermediate Pipe Donut Exhaust Leak,"2011 Subaru Forester with small leak at donut gasket between catalytic converter and intermediate Y pipe. At start up its ""louder"" but quiets as I presume pipe and donut warm up, I can feel small leak with hand on about ‚Öì of donut. 

Two days ago I replaced everything distal to cat pipe for a loud and leaking intermediate pipe.

When I removed the old donut gasket there wasn‚Äôt much lip left on the cat pipe to fit the new donut gasket around, the cat pipe flange had a lot of ""crud"" built up around it making it more or less flush. I tried to clean the area as best as possible and get the new donut gasket well seated but appears not given the leak. I sprayed new gasket with copper high temp sealer prior to putting on.

Car is  loud on first start up in AM and then quiets,  I can feel exhaust leaking with my hand around the donut gasket. Spring bolts are very hand tight and compressed. I‚Äôm afraid anymore tugging will over torque/round them.

Is this something that might seal itself up as the gasket forms with heat cycles or do I need to get a perfect seal from the get-go?

If I need to address it my thoughts were to:

1 - try an exhaust paste, could work but seems its often only a temp fix

2 - bring it to an exhaust shop and have them take a look. Maybe weld on a new flange with better lip for donut gasket. Permanent solution but nearest reputable exhaust shop is >1hr away unless I use the local Midas with mixed reviews

At my wits end with this car and if I can't get it to work I'm probably gonna sell it.

What I've done: I've read the DME bin file and backed it up, software version 430037. I've cloned it, ews deleted it manually, ews deleted it using tunerpro patch updated and re-uploaded it with using both Ms flasher and jm garage to no avail. Using Ms flasher I did it connected to the car directly and jmgarage as well but using bootmode.

I've flashed the bios to software version 430069 and tried cloning the isn to the new virgin software and then cloning it. Nothing. Does not sync with either Ms patcher nor inpa, gives error both ways. Tried patching with tuner pro AND manually with both checksum bypass and without, to no avail. So I'm lost.

1n07ket,Hydro locked or seized motor? Mk6 GLI - thoughts?,"2014 VW Jetta GLI EA 888 Gen 3 2.0 TSI. I don‚Äôt have a scanner but I‚Äôm pretty sure the car started misfiring yesterday right as I was about to park after driving it all day. it started jolting below 20 MPH and exhaust started to sound different & was idling rough. Turned car off and waited a minute.  That‚Äôs probably where I should have stopped but I decided to take it down the block to investigate since it all happened so quickly as I was pulling into my driveway, parked, and then it sounded ok. It cranked and fired up.

Got no more than 500 feet as it began slowing down and I smelled fuel in the cabin so I pulled over & turned it off. Tried to turn back on and it would crank but not fire up. Fuel smell coming from cabin, exhaust, a whiff as soon as I popped the hood & the dipstick wreaked of it/level over full (I just changed oil 1 month/1.5k miles ago). No oil leaks noticeable anywhere or punctures underneath. No fuel leaks noticeable by HPFP, PCV, or fuel rail. Left it down the block overnight.

This pointed me towards ignition/fuel, thinking it has something to do with the fuel injectors either leaking or being stuck open, therefore fuel pooling in the cylinder(s). Today, it wouldn‚Äôt crank with the key, battery is fine. I pulled the C1 spark plug and of course with these engines the coil pack boot gets stuck so I used an air tool to get it out, the photo attached with one plug/green on it is what the spark plug looked like & it wreaked of fuel. These plugs were put in less than 1 month ago, I‚Äôve also attached a photo of what the previous cylinder 1 spark plug looked like (photo of 4 plugs the one on left, looks like coolant maybe? Orange?) after being in far from Sep 2021-July 2025 for 20k miles (car is stage 1 so I was taught to change at 15-25k). I also used a scope down the C1 head and attached a photo, it appears dry/relatively little buildup/not scored on live video. Earlier this morning, there was a more prominent puddle of fuel but it seems to have either: dripped down to the oil pan and/or evaporated. By the time I was about to go for the other 3 cylinders the bed got here and I sent the car to VW, as this type of engine failure is for sure beyond my capabilities.

I had a mobile mechanic out who instantly said seized. Didn‚Äôt attempt to try to crank the pulley by hand which is what 2 of my mechanic friends said to do, pull all 3 plugs, check those and those cylinder heads, and try to crank it manually / get the fuel out. One of those guys friends was a master Vw tech and said he experienced a lot of flooding on the mk6 platform. Just curious what people‚Äôs thoughts are. Is it really as simple as if it doesn‚Äôt crank then I have mechanical failure within the block (rod, piston, bearing, etc?) or is it more likely that it could just be flooded and I need new fuel injectors / intake manifold gasket / throttle body gasket / maybe a new HPFP / new spark plug / new coils bc I ripped these reused ones ? Did I blow my motor?

Regardless. This shits getting fixed because I love this car and been fixing it up the past month so I‚Äôm not giving up on it. Just trying to learn. Thx

Hydrolocked means the combustion chamber is completely filled with a fluid. If that happens, the locked part of hydrolocked is gone when you remove the plugs. Removing the plugs allows the fluid to escape, and it will, in a big shower. Well, more like a messy squirt. 

It could be seized, and thats what turning it over by hand tells you. Thats like step one while investigating a died while driving concern. The rodent damage on the wiring harness could also be the culprit here. If they chewed through the coil power wire, it very well could kill the whole engine. 

If the coils have a series power circuit with individual  grounds, then chewing through the power wire would shut down all 4 coils simultaneously. In that scenario, fuel will still spray because the car is expecting the coils to fire. This scenario doesn't account for the no crank concern, so grain of salt here. 

Theres not enough info here to diagnose your problem and there are a lot of different problems that it could be. If it is seized, this is going to get expensive quickly.

The spark plugs look ok to me, but you have a slight valve cover leak in one hole. The discoloration is likely from fuel additives you are using or additives your favorite station is using."

1n07i1o,2018 Corolla p0171 lean code driving me nuts,"2018 Toyota Corolla, 150k miles

Been trying to get this thing fixed a while now, got the suspension worked on while its been out of commission.

Throwing a p0171(bank 1 lean), occasionally hard to start (need to give it gas), and it stalled on my last test drive.

Been working at it looking for a vacuum leak, but after changing some hoses (waiting on a new PCV hose), I did a ghetto smoke test and couldnt find a leak. System was full of smoke for sure too.

For some reason im suspecting the brake booster

Got a vacuum gauge and checked out the live data and got the following:

Vacuum 19 in/hg steady at idle (linked in before brake booster, booster isolated from system)

Vacuum 19 in/hg, wavering slightly downward at idle (linked inline at intake, booster hooked into system

Looking at the live data, the short trim is -2 to -3, long trim -8. Isnt negative counter-indicative of a lean code? Am I wrong there?

Pumping the brakes quickly causes the short trim to rise to +20, stopping makes it crash to -20 before recovering. Vacuum goes down to 15-16 in/hg while pumping as well. Not sure if this is normal.

On my last test after changing the axles and control arms, It felt very weak and stalled after I started moving after a stop.

The Vellfire is marketed as being more sporty and aggressively styled. It's easier to understand the difference when you realise that in Japan, the big manufacturers have multiple ""brands"" of dealerships. So if you want an Alphard you can go to a Toyota showroom, but if you want a Vellfire you have to go to a [Netz showroom](https://www.toyota-global.com/company/history_of_toyota/75years/data/automotive_business/sales/dealerships/japan/netz.html).

As far as parts is concerned, I don't think there's much problem. There's a few different parts dealers here who specialize in JDM stuff; I've heard good things about [Amayama](https://www.amayama.com/en), though I can't speak from personal experience.

If the car is worth less than the balloon hand it back to Ford and you‚Äôre at square one in terms of negotiating a deal wherever you like.

My current car is a 2007 Astra H CDti 1.7 that has just hit 130k miles. I've had the car since 70k miles, and overall it's been fairly reliable (save a few suspension issues). I've also just paid to get the leaky air condenser replaced, as I've got a pending long road trip to Spain and think it will be well needed, as well as the turbo intercooler, which was leaking oil. I've recently (10k miles ago) replaced the timing belt on it.

However, I've been offered my sibling's 2007 Polo s petrol 1.4 automatic at 70k miles for a good price (¬£500) as they've just upgraded and want it gone. On the plus side, this car is future-proof for the Clean Air Zone in my city, which may expand. However, I mainly use my car for longer journeys and holidays and prefer not to drive in the city anyway. It's worth noting this car has not got its AC working (could be the condenser, which is a cruel irony), but hasn‚Äôt been properly investigated, so could just need a regas if I'm lucky. I also don't think it has had its timing belt replaced for some time, and it is due a new MOT in October. On the plus side, it does have a modern stereo installed with android auto/carplay but I‚Äôm not super fussed about it anyway.

I've come here looking for some advice from anyone that knows more about cars than I do (note, the bar is very low)...

In short. My 2017 Vauxhall Astra (Diesel, just short of 100k miles, full yearly service history) suffered a catastrophic breakdown and had to get towed over the weekend as the breaks failed completely and the dash warned about low oil pressure and to turn engine off immediately, in addition there's now also a loud rattling noise from under the bonnet. 

This was completely unexpected with no issues leading up to the breakdown. 

I've been told I need a timing chain replacement, oil pump and most likely a vacuum pump, however they can't confirm the latter until the first two are fixed. 

I'm looking at about ¬£2400 for the timing chain and oil pump. Is this a reasonable price? I'm Hampshire based fwiw. 

Then most likely another ¬£400 or so for the vacuum pump. 

The other aspect I  have to consider is that I owe about ¬£3000 on the finance still (due by end of Jan 2026) but I don't know if it'll be worth this hefty repair cost or if I should just cut my losses and pay the car off and scrap or sell as spares and repair.. Definitely could use some views on this one.

Really hoping somebody can help with my issue below and sorry for the long winded story, think it's important to give all the context.

Last month I bought a 24 Volkswagen Arteon R with approx 4k miles on the clock. It came with the standard ""Adelaide"" 19"" style wheels which I believe are 8J ET40 and Pirelli P Zero tyres.  
  
I wasn't fussed on the OEM wheels so I purchased some replica ""RS6"" style wheels from CM Wheels which are 19"" 8.5 ET30. I then put the ""old"" Pirelli P Zero tyres from the old wheels to the new wheels as they'd only covered 4k miles. They have spigot rings also.

Since then I've got what I think is a balancing issue. The steering wheel very slightly wobbles at approx 65-75mph. I took the car to a Pro Tyre garage and asked them to check the balancing to which they said they are correctly balanced.

After looking around on various forums etc at people with similar issues, a few suggested it gets put on a hunter road force balancing machine. So I made the trip from North Wales to Wigan today to do this. They found a slight imbalance on both front tyres so that has been corrected. One of the tyres was removed and readjusted.

The issue for you is that most M57 cars will be moon mileage in 2025 so they're gunna have turbulent MOT history, especially given that they're older diesels used as workhorses/commuters. That and the fact they're relatively cheap these days so the previous owner or two probably doesn't care as much as the first owners did

1n0gczh,"Hit a deer in an old banger I was planning to replace, no longer runs, what to do","First post!

Context - at time of incident I was driving an old Vauxhall which I was planning to replace shortly for a bigger family car. Intended to try and sell the Vauxhall but wasn‚Äôt expecting more than the WeBuyAnyCar price of ¬£500. Scrapping it had crossed my mind at one point.

Hit a muntjac late the other night at 50+mph in said Vauxhall. I had my 2 year old asleep in the back of the car, so decided to carry on home to get him into bed. When that was sorted and I came to inspect the damage, which is best described as catastrophic - grille and bumper in pieces, fluid pouring out, radiator very clearly smashed up. Pottered the car around the corner to get it off the double yellows I‚Äôd left it on: bits started falling off as I went over speed bumps, the engine cut out eventually. Clearly fucked. Given I was planning to replace imminently and it was already a tired car, I‚Äôm obviously going to scrap it.

To the insurance - I had no plan to claim as the car was scrap to me anyway. All the advice online was to tell the insurance company anyway. So, I reported it saying I wasn‚Äôt going to claim. I now regret this. The incident will be recorded as ‚Äòat fault‚Äô (can hardly blame the deer), and I‚Äôm now sure it‚Äôs going to have a significant impact on my renewal/quotes next year.

Am I right that in this specific scenario I \*should\* have kept it to myself, quietly scrapped the car, and then updated the insurance with my replacement vehicle without mentioning an incident? I‚Äôd like to help out a future banger-driving deer collider who turns to Reddit for the answer to this specific question.

Second question - my policy offers a payout of ¬£400 for scrapping the vehicle. Given I‚Äôve already told the insurance company about the incident, will it have a significant impact on future insurance to claim this ¬£400? Should I go for it or leave it alone?",19,1756197298.0,26,CartalkUK,1756323237,2025-08-26 08:34:58,2025-08-27 19:33:57,"Mobile-Laugh3222 (Score: 44): Should of scrapped the car and not told insurance.
