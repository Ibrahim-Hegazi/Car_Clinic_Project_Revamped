1nt3ik4,BMW Z3 no start,"2001 BMW Z3 roadster 2.5i / inline 6. This is a weird one. 

I’ve been working on this car for about a month after pulling it out of a friend’s yard which sat for 3 years. Filled tank with proper gas and jumped battery and it started right up, drove it for 5 miles and back. 

A week later it cranks with absolutely no sign of life, full tank of gas but car reads empty. Changed the fuel pump and the sending unit, fuel pump relay, and fuel filter. Z3 ended up starting and running rough for awhile but eventually stalled out after a few minutes, wont turn back over and the tank still reads empty. Multimetered everything from the fuses to the fuel pump connections and it’s all mint but fuel system is failing to pressurize and no fuel is getting to the engine. There are no obvious signs of a leak.

I’m ready to just get it towed to a shop and go from there so I’m open to any suggestions before I bite the bullet.",1,1759103782.0,7,MechanicAdvice,1759174406,2025-09-28 23:56:22,2025-09-29 19:33:26,FixxerAuto (Score: 1): Probably a bad fuel pump- they dont like sitting for years with corn gas

1nt2xb8,2011 Jeep Liberty - No crank No start,"For context I was gifted this jeep from a family member who is not mechanically inclined and not interested in fixing its issues. To start , I used my scanner and read the codes from the car, (about 17…) and one was a transmission code. I had noticed the transmission pan had a leak, so I did a simple change and gave it a new gasket, although the “old” fluid inside of it seemed fairly new considering the miles. 

Then the next day I went to pick some stuff up with the Jeep and on the way home I lost all power and got the transmission overheated light. I assumed it was because I left it idling for 45 minutes roughly, and maybe the fan hadn’t kicked in. But after a Tow home later, once on the driveway it actually turned on easily. After that I left it for the night. The next morning I went to do a minor test and turned it on for about 15 minutes. During this I went inside, and when I came back out the car was off. The radiator fan was on though, and I could feel warmth on both sides of the trans cooling lines. As a safety I changed the transcooler/AC condenser unit. Which by now had its fins falling out. After this I changed the transmission fluid again to be safe, and went to try and start. I get full power to the dash, but turning the key to start I am met with nothing. Other than shift lock engaging, and the interior blower motor momentarily running while I hold the start.

What I have tested - 

Note- I have a cheaper obd2 scanner. If you think a more real mechanic level scanner would help, I have an option to borrow one.

- Starter circuit: New starter installed. Jumping 30→87 at the starter relay or feeding the solenoid with a Power Probe makes it crank strong. Battery 12.6 V, grounds good. This is currently the only way I can make it crank at all.

- Ignition switch: suspecting this, I swapped it with a duralast replacement. But once I install this new switch, I get the SKIS red dot. Im not sure how these two are correlated, but after uninstalling the replacement and reinstalling the original switch back in, the SKIS red dot goes out but key still won’t crank. Testing the volts, coming from wires connected to the switch, CONSTANT = ~12v looks good. RUN WIRE = in the run position I get ~12v looks good. START WIRE = passively I get ~1v passively, then dropping to ~0.4v once attempting to hold start position. Although if I remove my meter and re attach I can hear the starter relay click each time. I even tried to mix and match the new with the old, but anything new makes the red dot come back.

- TIPM/relays: Jumping the positive and ground pins that the starter relay needs for it to engage does cause it to crank. Showing that the starter relay does work. No change occurs when swapping relays. Fuses M19 (25 A ASD #1/2) and M21 (20 A ASD #3) have no power on either side. Feeding M19 manually with +12 V, while jumping the starter relay to crank the engine, still won’t make it start. Also testing the signal wire to a coil gives nothing. It has 12v wire, but probing the other wire gives nothing while cranking.

- PCM power/ground: M28 (10 A PCM/Trans Feed) hot with key ON. PCM grounds good. OBD scanner now connects (after stating no vehicle was found.) but shows no live data. Just 0/0 under these data sets. I also have a check engine light on the dash, but the scanner reads nothing.

- SKIS: Red immobilizer dot now off with original switch (key recognised).

- Transmission/PRNDL: Gear indicator will intermittently appear, with the squares surrounding each the gears, but recently has been blank, in addition the “Transmission Overtemp” light came on randomly while the engine was cold. Thought it went away. No injector or coil pulse while cranking.

Any help, suggestions, or even photos, would be greatly appreciated. I am so lost by now I have no idea what to do next. I am really hoping it’s not related to the transmission sensors as those suck to get to.",0,1759102106.0,4,MechanicAdvice,1759174406,2025-09-28 23:28:26,2025-09-29 19:33:26,"Jasonh123_ (Score: 2): I don’t mean to oversimplify it, but did you have the battery load tested for cranking amps?"

1nt2jln,95 Jeep Cherokee 4.0L overheating,"Symptoms:

Overheats at idle and while driving. However, If I'm driving and I keep the heater on while maintaining 2k rpm or less, it'll run at normal operating temperature. This has primarily been the way I've painstakingly drove it for the past year now. As soon as I stop at a light it's a matter of seconds until the needle slowly starts creeping towards the red. Temperature returns to normal once I get back into that 2k rpm drive.

Diagnosis:

Block tested, head gasket is still good. Pressure tested, no leaks. Electric fan only operated when A/C was on, did not self activate at operating temperature.

Parts replaced:

Radiator, thermostat, electric fan. Manually wired a fan switch to my dash.

  
Conclusion:

So far, nothing has worked. Initially I thought that because the electric fan wasn't turning on, that was the issue, but clearly that isn't the case. The fan has always worked with the A/C turning on, however it will overheat no matter what RPM I maintain without that extra support from the heater. Again there's no leaks and the head gasket is still good. No misfires either. I have since removed the manual fan switch and reconnected the fan to the main harness. Fan still does not activate when reaching operating temperature.

Honestly, I am at my wits end with this hunk of junk. This is basically my last ditch attempt to get this pig running properly before I sell it for pennies on marketplace. Thanks in advance.

 if you have installed a lower temp thermostat.. you could have it opening. 

 do you have only electric fan .. that model came with a fan clutch.. a thermostatic operated fan clutch..  there is a bimetallic spring on the front of the fan clutch..  when the thermostat opens. the hot coolant flowing into the radiator causes the fan clutch bimetallic spring to allow silicone oil between the flat plates in the fan clutch increasing the torque applied to the fan blade. 

 fan clutches do wear out. they leak the silicone fluid out. then there is not enough fluid to transfer enough torque to make the fan spin fast enough . 

 if you only have an electric fan.. you may have too thin wires and not giving the electric fan enough current/voltage to spin at full speed.."
1nt29p8,F150 not turning over,"An update!

Yall were right about it being fuel related, but in a different way. It was fuel but I was empty!

I just had to replace the fuel fill neck the other day due to having codes with the evap system. The inner tab wasn’t locking closed (could open it with my finger), but also my tank wasn’t purging the fumes so I couldn’t fill. I’ve replaced the purge valve (didn’t fix it) and now the fuel filler neck. But I noticed that my gas jumped from like 88 miles remaining to 144 overnight after I replaced my fuel neck. I assumed it was just recalibrating for some reason. But now I see that something is just wrong with my fuel fill level sensor (or some sensor in general related to fuel, prolly why it’s not venting gasses). So now I gotta figure that out!

So I am now getting my car towed back to my house and trying to figure out where to go from here.

1nt023i,Intermittent A/C Cooling on 2010 Ford Fusion Hybrid - Seeking Diagnosis Advice,"I'm the second owner of a **2010 Ford Fusion Hybrid (FFH)** and have never done any A/C work since acquiring it in 2016. Recently, I've noticed an intermittent problem with the A/C not blowing cold.

 The Problem

* The A/C fails to blow cold air sometimes.
* When it fails, I get room-temperature air (or slightly warm air) from the vents.
* It's **intermittent**: sometimes the cold air kicks in after 5 minutes; other times it just stays warm.
* This happens on both sides of the **dual-zone A/C** with no noticeable difference in temperature between the driver and passenger vents.

 What I've Tried

A few weeks ago, I tried to check the pressure with an Arctic Freeze kit gauge:

1. When initially setting the climate control to **MAX A/C** and **60°F**, the electronic compressor did **not** kick in immediately. The gauge needle was in the **red zone**.
2. Once the compressor *did* kick in (and I felt cold air), the pressure read **50 PSI**, which is at the upper limit of the ""green zone"" on the gauge. (Ambient temperature was about 85∘F.)
3. A mobile mechanic added a small amount of R-134a (less than 12oz), trying to reach the 50−55 PSI target for that temperature. However, the gauge needle did **not** move, which makes me question if the gauge was working properly.

Despite adding a bit of refrigerant, the intermittent issue has returned with the same symptoms.

Seeking Advice

The mechanic suggested a full **A/C system evacuation and refill ($250)** to spec (22oz). I'd prefer to properly diagnose the issue before spending that much on what might only be a test.

I know potential culprits could be a **fuse problem, blend door actuator issue, the HVAC control module, or the compressor itself**.

Has anyone experienced this intermittent cooling issue on a 2010 FFH? **What steps can I take for a proper diagnosis before going for a full $250 recharge?**

I bought the car a few months ago and it had blown head gaskets. I happened to have a line on a good donor motor for only 600 bucks so I went the route of just swapping the motors. Now I can rebuild the heads on this original motor and just keep swapping the 2 back and forth forever. Anywho. After cranking it up and fixing some other minor suspension issues I've got a weird rattle sound coming from what seems to be the bottom end.

The rattle seems to come whenever the engine gets more rpms from a base line... what I mean by that is if im cruising at highway speeds lets say 60mph and I bump it to 70mph to overtake another car, it'll rattle... but at cruising speeds nothing. Or from a stop sign, rattle. Also worth mentioning and you can tell from the video you don't have to be moving for it to rattle.

I do have a vacuum leak that I suspect is coming from my PCV hose that causes the rpms to surge at idle. I can get it into this state when its been driven a bit and warmed up and thats how I can get the rattle to come and go while parked for the video. Just a hissing sound from the PCV hose but grabbing it doesn't seem to help me find where the leak itself is to try and temporarily tape it up or something. I replaced the PCV valve itself hoping it was just that with no luck

A few things I've already checked for:

* Heat shields loose or bent and hitting something, can't find any
* Replaced the supercharger coupler and did an oil service on it, no change
* Checked exhaust couplers at the cats, all nice and tight
* Flex plate bolts are nice and tight
* Octane booster in gas, no luck
* New MAF sensor, no luck
* Seafoam through throttle body to clean pistons of carbon, no luck
* Seafoam in fuel to help clean injectors, no luck
* Fuel filter hoping it was clogged up and causing lean conditions, no luck
* Starter motor, thought it may have not been disengaging but a wood dowel on the motor while it rattles I hear nothing abnormal
* Transmission fluid is fine, but the rattle comes even in park so don't think transmission or differentials anyways...

1nsxo4f,"Transmission Replacement Gone Wrong – Shop Closed, Car Still Inside","I own a 2016 Toyota Corolla with 106,000 miles. I purchased it certified used at 60,000 miles and have taken it to the same mechanic for the past seven years. I’ve always followed all recommended maintenance, including tune-ups where I was told fluids were changed. My car was running fine until recently, when I was told the shocks were starting to wear. I had them replaced at a different shop, and the car still seemed fine afterward.

A couple of days later, I had a new radio installed at Best Buy (a gift from my partner). Immediately after installation, the emergency brake light stayed on. I returned the same day, and they admitted something had been knocked loose during the install and corrected it. On the drive home, however, I noticed my car felt “off.” The RPMs were higher than normal for the same speed, and the car sounded different—almost like it was under extra load. I initially thought I might just be noticing it more because of the new radio, but after another drive, it was clear something was wrong.

I returned to the shop that had replaced my shocks. They confirmed the issue and told me it was likely the transmission. The mechanic described it as if the car were stuck in “sport mode.” He checked the transmission fluid, which was dark brown, oily, and had metallic specks in it. He said this indicated my CVT transmission was failing, likely because the fluid had never been replaced. He recommended a low-mileage replacement transmission.

On my family’s advice, I took the car to a transmission-only shop to see if it could be rebuilt. They also advised against rebuilding and recommended replacement. They persuaded me to go with them instead of the shop that did my shocks, saying, “All we do is transmissions.” Their shop was closer and $300 cheaper, so I agreed. This turned out to be a mistake.

Initially, I was promised a 1–2 day turnaround. I prepaid most of the cost. On 9/12, I was told the wrong transmission had been delivered (it had more miles than promised). The correct one would arrive 9/15. It was installed, but by 9/16 I was told my car still wasn’t driving correctly and the replacement transmission needed to be reprogrammed. This was scheduled for 9/17. Since that date, the shop has been closed.

I have been without my car since 9/12. On 9/24, I received one text message saying the owner had been in the hospital and that his sons would reopen the shop the next day. That never happened. The shop remains closed, with my car still inside, and I cannot get updates.

At this point, I don’t know the true status of my car or whether the transmission was even the real issue (since it still wasn’t driving correctly after replacement). This shop has been in business for over 10 years, but I feel stuck and desperate. There’s another transmission shop directly across the street that I could potentially move my car to—if I can even get it back.

I need advice:

* Is my next step contacting the police or another authority to recover my vehicle?
* Given how far this has gone off track, am I still reasonably expected to pay the full agreed amount? (Transmission cost $2500, labor was supposed to be $750---I prepaid $2200 towards transmission).
* How can I best protect myself moving forward?",3,1759088741.0,5,MechanicAdvice,1759174406,2025-09-28 19:45:41,2025-09-29 19:33:26,"Optimal_Cupcake2159 (Score: 7): Urgh, what a situation...! That sounds terrible.

Okay. I'd contact the police and discuss the situation and ask them for advice - maybe just them calling the shop and asking why they're holding your property should be enough for them to return it.

One text message isn't good enough, be sure to tell them that and the time they've held it.

If the shop contacts you, as a bargaining chip, tell them you're prepared to pay the return freight costs on the new/rebuilt transmission and any diagnosis time and that you just want your car back.

Once recovered, I would then avoid that shop, and the shop that did the shocks. It's a fairly tall order to go blaming a transmission at 106,000 miles. They seem to be playing up the fact it's a CVT - Toyota CVTs are somewhat more reliable than Nissan's, which have given CVTs a bad name (the angle they might be playing).

I'd want to know what the trouble codes are they pulled, if they did a proper diagnosis. You can find OBD II scanners for cheap on eBay etc, you could read those codes yourself and look for anything transmission related.

Since you said it was driving normally, save for those hiccups, your suspicion is probably right that it wasn't the transmission.

Right after that, the ECP light came on. Then, when I stopped at a red light, the low oil pressure light and warning beep came on, telling me to shut the car off. I immediately pulled over and turned the engine off. When I did, I heard a very loud noise, and the cooling fan kept running for a while. When I tried restarting, the engine cranked weakly like it wanted to start but wouldn’t. I waited and tried again a few times, but now it won’t start at all. I checked oil levels through the car’s system, and they showed as fine. The engine can still be turned manually, so I don’t think it seized. Has anyone experienced something similar? Any advice on what could be going on would be greatly appreciated.",2,1759082584.0,6,MechanicAdvice,1759174406,2025-09-28 18:03:04,2025-09-29 19:33:26,"Aromatic_Employee_62 (Score: 1): The starter relay is good the fuses are good.

1nss3l1,09 Odyssey with sudden multiple cylinder misfires.,"Hello all....

Short question : can a bad fuel pump or regulator cause sudden, multiple, misfires?

I have a 2009 touring odyssey with 197k miles on it.  I've never had any real problems with it, and I've had it for about 8 years since 80k.  I VMC muzzled it when I got it by just putting an 82ohm resistor inline with the temp sensor.  I didn't buy a fancy one.  I've performed all maintenance on it, mostly on time, and it's been a great car.  My wife was driving this last week when the car suddenly stopped running.  It gave multiple messages and was unable to get to speed.  It would only do about 2 miles an hour.  We towed it home.  The engine was smoking a lot and it was a full 2 quarts low on oil (nothing on the dipstick - which really surprised me).  Codes are (a weird) CT1555, P0300, P0301, P0302, P0303, P0304, P0305, and P0306.  It will also occasionally display a 'check VSA' message and flash the VSA light on the dash.  

I've been battling an annoying oil leak from the front spool valve and the front valve cover gasket.  This made the alternator start to fail with occasional messages to 'check the charging system'.  It was intermittent over the last 3 weeks, but it was on my radar to fix it soon and replace the oil killed alternator.  

After it died, I fixed the valve cover gasket, the spool valve gasket, and replaced the alternator.  The issue did not resolve, but it seems like it is no longer leaking.  I changed the battery with a known good battery; nothing.  I removed all the spark plugs and inspected them and the coils.  They were all OK as the plugs are only 25k miles old (Denso iridium).  I found that the #3 coil had a melted insulator boot, and the spring and conductor inside it was melted to the spark plug. That's obviously a problem.  It measured at 1870 ohms, where all other coils measured between 1720 and 1750.  I replaced it with a good (?) one from LKQ along with the auto lite spark plug with it.  I moved the coils and plugs front to back (4 to 1, 5 to 2, 6 to 3 with the 'new' one in #6).  It did not change anything.  I removed my VMC muzzle resistor.   That didn't help. 

Over the last  year, it's had a hard start issue where it would occasionally take 8-10 seconds to start.  It would start fine if I let it prime.  That hasn't been a big deal.   I haven't noticed any significant drop in mileage or drivability. 

I really don't want to continue throwing money at this.

EDIT : I got a fuel pressure tester from Harbor Freight and although I wasn't 100% completely able to connect it inline, I was able to connect it to the fuel pump side of the line.  At start-up cranking, it shoots up to 59psi, then after two seconds it drops to 57.  When I stop, the pressure bleeds pretty quickly down to about 30 psi in 60 seconds. 59 psi is within range of the test results (57 to 64 psi).  The bleed down tells me that the pressure regulator is bad in the pump, but I already knew that much.  It shouldn't cause this problem, though.",1,1759075478.0,4,MechanicAdvice,1759174406,2025-09-28 16:04:38,2025-09-29 19:33:26,"BeautyIsTheBeast383 (Score: 2): Can you get any freeze frame on the powertrain codes?

Another artifact of OBDII you see a lot on neglected vehicles is how it stops at the first major issue.  e.g. if you unplug one of the oxygen sensors, it will put the system into an open loop mode and usually derate the engine a bit.  Too many such vehicles get sold as ""just needs sensor"".

NOPE!!!  I had a customer who bought an 06 RX330 with a code for a knock sensor and a downstream O2 sensor heater.  Not a quick job, since the engine needs to be torn down to the long block on the top.  And quality knock sensors are expen$$$ive.  I discussed it with the customer and ended up doing vampire taps to join the wires from the bad sensor to the lone good one.  Before anyone asks, yes, I did it on the sub harness side, which is supposed to be replaced along with the sensors.  Also replaced the O2 sensor that was literally burned down to the nub.

The knock sensor and heated O2 codes went away, but the engine immediately started throwing misfires on bank 1.  The fun one.  Luckily I have smaller hands and was able to switch a couple coils to id the coil as the fault.  Shortly after, the vehicle presented with an exhaust leak and signs of cat blockage.

Blockage was repaired and the vehicle drove well enough for the customer to give it a break and that's the last I heard of it.  Oh, the rack and pinion was leaking badly as well.

1nsqsly,Help with intermittent start/run of 1997 Dodge Dakota V6,"Greetings,

I am tearing my hair out. My Dodge Dakota had what started as an intermittent issue where it would occasionally hesitate to start (good crank, took a few tries). It is not a no start.

No spark. I have been following steps in the Chilton as closely as I can with my diagnostic tools. I have checked the ignition coil with a meter, good primary and secondary resistance. 

I went through a whole thing with the automatic shutdown relay where I thought it was bad, bypassed it, started the truck and she ran, then I swapped relays around a bit and found that all of them work as expected (in addition to testing them with voltage and a meter for continuity). I think this was all just a coincidence and nothing to do with the current issue.

I pulled the crankshaft position sensor. Very dirty. I cleaned it and reinstalled, she started. I was certain I'd found the smoking gun so I swapped the crankshaft position sensor. Started with the new sensor. No start.

I cleaned and reinstalled the distributor and crankshaft position sensor. No evidence of any issues with either. No start.

No DTCs on the OBD II. OBD II system doesn't always connect but I'm pretty sure that is local to the wiring harness because when I smush them the scanner will connect.

Seems to be more of a problem when the car is cold, but at this point I am totally lost in the sauce.

Did you have to replace any calipers or open the brake lines for any reason when you replaced the brake pads?  Either way, the first thing to try is a proper bleeding of the brake system and see if that takes care of the problem.

Any external leak in the brake system would cause a loss of fluid.  You would notice the level dropping in the brake fluid reservoir, and oily spots of brake fluid where you park.

Do you find yourself having to give the brakes a quick pump sometimes because the pedal bottoms out at long red lights?  Try sitting in the car, engine running, parking brake off and transmission in park, and hold the brake pedal down.  It should settle and stop at some point.  If it keeps going, eventually ending with the pedal on the floor, you very likely have an internal leak in the master cylinder.  It could take up to 2 minutes to sink the to floor if the internal leak is very small.  When the seal(s) on the master cylinder piston go bad, it allows brake fluid past the seals and it returns to the reservoir.

The fix for that is to replace the master cylinder.

Currently I'm a bit stuck. I'm working on my '05 Subaru Legacy wagon and I need to get a new brake backing plate on in order to pass the bi-yearly inspection. This backing plate is squished between the trailing arm and the wheel bearing. As such, I need to get the wheel bearing out.
In good news: all bolts came out and there is play between the bearing and trailing arm (so it will come out). 
The bad news: as replacing the backing plate or the bearing wasn't something I was planning on doing when the car went on the jack, I didn't loosen the driveaxle nut. Lowering the car right now is nut possible, so I can't put the wheel back on.

1nsmfth,Can a faulty car key set off a car alarm when the car is unlocked?,"Hi! Hope its okay to post this here!

About a month ago our car alarm went off at 4 am at we had a lot of trouble stopping it. We changed the key battery, at it stopped briefly before starting again. It went on for about 10 minutes before it completely stopped.

Then the next night it went off at 3 am. My dad left it unlocked and with all the doors open. But it just started again. We had to repeatedly hit the close button on the key. It stopped after about 10 minutes again.

Then same thing at 8 am.

We dropped it off at the mechanic and he said it was a faulty door handle. That he would order home.

We parked it at my stepmoms garage and it was quiet for 2 weeks.

We had to go to the mall one day, and on our way back to the car it stayed again when we were about 20-30 meters from it. And then again in the garage.

After we had the new door handle on, it started again. So we though it might be the key. So now we only use my stepmoms key.

My question is, does it sound plausible that’s it’s the key? And why did the car alarm still go off when it’s unlocked and doors are open??

Improper IAC, aftermarket Idle control solenoids are a gamble on Fords, there's a secret recipe and not every supplier knows it. Used OEM may be better option than most aftermarket unfortunately.

Incorrect TPS signal. Some TPS units have to be indexed when installed to preload the sensor, otherwise they can report an incorrect position. That will cause the ECM to open the idle valve in the expectation the engine is off idle and will return to idle at any moment. The valve is kept open to prevent a stall. It then compensates at actual idle based on learned values in the ECM. 

Speaking of the Learned values. Ford uses a Keep Alive Memory factor stored in the ECM to tailor the fuel trims and idle speeds. Disconnecting the battery for a few minutes should effectively reset the KAM settings and maybe restore the engine to idle.

Vacuum leaks, PCV, or intake gasket leaks aren't uncommon on the Ford lineup and if you cap the IAC inlet hose while it's idling and it doesn't stall you have a good sized leak or a throttle blade not completely closed. 

A scanner with TPS data and IAC counts would really be helpful."

Hello, so the problem started when my shifter cable snapped and my car was stuck in reverse. Car couldn't be shut off because it's a fob, so battery eventually died while the car was running in reverse with the e break on. The battery had to be replaced since it wouldn't hold a charge.

Got it fixed. It was a bad week for me. 

Anyways two days later check engine light and abs light come on. Take it back to mechanics and they say nothing is wrong with it. They clear the codes. The lights come on 2 days later again. I get these scanners off amazon. In the middle of using the scanner car temp light comes on indicating the car is overheating. Engine isn't even on. I shut off immediately.

1nso7z7,2003 Nissan 350z 3.6L,"Hey everyone,
I need some help with my car. I drained the oil and what came out was that thick “chocolate milkshake” sludge. I know that means my coolant and oil are mixing somewhere.
Right now, I’m trying to figure out the smartest next step:
I already drained the oil, but it’s not all the way out (still some sludge in there).
I was planning to do a couple of cheap flush cycles (fill with cheap oil + maybe ½–1 quart of ATF or diesel fuel, idle for a few minutes, then drain) just to get as much of the gunk out as possible before I tear it apart.


I also don’t drive this car at all , maybe 3-4 times a year for no more than 30 mins . Last time I did an oil change was in the end of November 2024.

Questions:
Is flushing like that worth doing before I tear into it, or should I just go straight to pulling the head?

Could it still be something like the oil cooler instead of the head gasket?

If the bottom end already took damage from coolant in the oil, am I wasting my time on a head gasket and should I just look for a replacement engine?

I’ve got basic tools, torque wrench, and time — just not sure if I’m taking the best approach.

So to start I have a 2019 Escalade 6.2 L86 V8 with around 97,500 miles that I just purchased, and after a week of driving I noticed a fuel smell under hood and noticed it by the intake area. After taking the intake and insulator cover off I see that the cylinder 6 injector bore is wet. I pulled the bank 2 injector rail with all the injectors, and the the injector body on #6 was cracked so I replaced that one injector and resealed the other 3. Got it back together, took it for a short drive and the MIL turned on with code P219B. There were no codes in the ECM before hand with the cracked #6 injector. While monitoring long term fuel trims, bank 2 was in the -20 area which tells me it’s pulling fuel (running rich) so there is no vacuum leak and if it were a maf sensor issue, we would see issues on both banks.I performed an injector balance test and bank 2 was all over the place after doing the calculations GM says, 3 of the 4 injector would fail. Bank 1 is perfect. The scan tool reports no misfires. Performed a fuel trim reset. Took it back apart and visually inspected everything. I verified I ordered the correct injector based off the original part number. I am just very confused. My only theory’s I have are that the new injector is bad, or the three old ones are not vibing/balancing out with the one new one, but I am open to any thoughts of suggestions. I have 4 new injectors on the way from rock auto, and for my own peace of mind, a new injector harness.

Yall were right about it being fuel related, but in a different way. It was fuel but I was empty!

I just had to replace the fuel fill neck the other day due to having codes with the evap system. The inner tab wasn’t locking closed (could open it with my finger), but also my tank wasn’t purging the fumes so I couldn’t fill. I’ve replaced the purge valve (didn’t fix it) and now the fuel filler neck. But I noticed that my gas jumped from like 88 miles remaining to 144 overnight after I replaced my fuel neck. I assumed it was just recalibrating for some reason. But now I see that something is just wrong with my fuel fill level sensor (or some sensor in general related to fuel, prolly why it’s not venting gasses). So now I gotta figure that out!

So I called AAA and they came out to check and test my battery. The battery tested good while the charging system showed up as 1.53, low, according to whatever the devices they are using. So I am now getting my car towed back to my house and trying to figure out where to go from here.

From what I am reading it could be my starter, my alternator, or weirdly enough, my fuel ignition. When I try to start the car, it’s trying to turn over, it just doesn’t.

I have a 2017 Hyundai Elantra. Engine only takes 4.2 quarts of oil. I top of the oil myself but for whatever reason Friday, I decided to put in all five quarts of oil. It smoked from the exhaust immediately. I drove home on the highway for 35 minutes. Saturday, I went to the gas station a few times, maybe 10 minutes away. Smoke came out of exhaust a few times and had somewhat of a hard start to accelerate. 

Well this morning, as soon as I started it, it began shaking. Engine light came on and started flashing. Drove it to get an oil change. That’s where I learned I overfilled the engine like a dummy. They also checked my engine light, which is reading as a misfire. The car is still shaking and engine light flashes as soon as I accelerate. 

I’m reading that it’s possible the spark plugs need to be changed. Is this accurate? Anything else I need to know? (I now know how to check my oil levels for future notice) 

Hoping I didn’t just eff up my engine due to a stupid a** mistake. 


Update: there was a lot of oil on the spark plug I pulled out. I cleaned off all the oil inside and replaced the spark plug, and now it’s running smoothly.

Do you imagine no guy has ever done this? I guarantee you they have. Guys have also not put in oil after draining it and driven their cars with no oil. You know what the difference is? You will admit it. 

It may to too early to tell if you have serious damage or not. 35 mins seems like a long time to drive with 2x the amount of oil in the car. I would carefully look for leaks. You could have gasket or seal damage. You could have other damage as well, but this will be the easiest to check for.

Waited 15 minutes, started again, and was able to get it to the workshop.  Had some spares so decided to swap out the whole system.

- New distributor with electronic ignition (Powerspark vs the old Unilite)

- New matching coil (no need for a ballast resistor this time, so it was deleted)

First shot it started up but then stalled a few seconds later and that has been pretty consistent.  If I let it sit overnight it will probably start again, but it dies after a few seconds.  Currently:

- 12.4v at battery

- 12.1v at lead to coil (disconnected when testing) with ignition on but starter off.

- 9.6v at coil+ when cranking.

- Cranks but does not start, and the vid shows a tester on the #1 plug 

- Strong gassy smell, so probably flooding (hence the need to wait before a re-try).

Some things I have done:

- Charged battery before the attached vid was taken

- Ensured the distributor was not 180 out

- Double checked all wires and leads (at least twice now!)

Anyways, let’s just say you leased an Altima, Accord or Camry (or something similar) and from the second you took it off the new car lot, high revs, quick starts, etc (no break in period at all)…and basically started car and drove it hard/not take it easy after a cold start…

Essentially all of the things that cause potential wear and tear on engine (not letting oil get up to operating temp).

Would the car last just fine up to 15-20K miles / 3 years? I’d imagine tires and brakes would be more worn, but still not in the replaceable range yet. 

I understand lots of folks already do this as regular drivers 🤣 🤦🏻‍♂️, but was just kinda curious if anything serious would happen by the 15-20K mark over 3 years (not a lot of driving). 

I baby the cars and hand them back pristine every time…wondering what wound actually happen if I did the opposite? 

Im also not really talking about speeding, driving recklessly etc. just basically always getting into car and driving off within 1-2 sec and not paying attention to car being cold/at temp, no break in period, lots of quick starts and basically just driving more spirited (as much as an economy sedan could be). 

Thanks and sorry if I’m ranting or asking a silly question haha

Although this post will likely get you a lot of flack about how it happened, the point here is the bump stops are just a convenience that when you bottom out the suspension it makes it less noisy or easier to handle, it isn't really a safety concern and you can continue to drive normally.

* The first one wanted to take the engine apart.
* The second one said he would first replace the carburetor cover, and if that doesn’t fix it, then replace the manifold. If that also doesn’t work, I guess he would keep changing parts one by one and charge me for all of them.
* The third one also wanted to start a major job without really knowing the actual cause.

A 2020 Astra doesn’t have a carburetor, you can’t pull the cover off that obviously.

Squeaking noise on those has a few typical sources from my experience.

1. crankshaft seal rings, either side.

2. spark plugs, when changed in very hot weather (35C+), they can start leaking when it gets colder outside which sometimes creates a squeal

3. serpentine belt touching something or pulley bearing being done, spray some silicone lubricant on and see if it stops, if it does, replace the belt and pulley

4. crank vent broken, often requires a new and expensive valve cover (oem like 700€)

5. general air leak, both pressing air out and pulling air in can cause this noise

Normally squealing is caused by dry/not properly lubed rubber on metal or by air.

Ways to test this are:

Use a very long screwdriver and push it against the part you think is the cause, put your ear on it, the noise will be audibly louder the closer you get.

Use a fog machine and fog the engine bay with it, you will see the fog move close to where the noise comes from when it’s air related.

Is it the F14SHT or one of the 1.4 SIDI (B/D 14XFL/ XFT)?

It’s easily identifiable by transmission and power.

- This car uses the IPDM fuse box.
- The O2 sensor fuse had tripped, and both upstream O2 sensors were throwing codes.
- I haven’t started the car since replacing the fuse or taking those temp readings.


So now I’m wondering: should I reinstall the passenger-side cat and fire it up with the new fuse, or test it off the car somehow, or just gut it and be done with it?

For reference, the driver-side cat is aftermarket and shows consistent temps from inlet to outlet, so I’m guessing it's not doing much either. Maybe gutting is the way?

Any advice appreciated!

1nshula,Vibration Issue After Installing New Tires on 2022 Corolla,"Hi,

I recently bought a used 2022 Toyota Corolla from a Toyota Certified dealer. The car came with safety certification, but unfortunately, the tires were in poor condition. One of them even burst, so I replaced all of them with GT Radial tires when the car had about 65,000 km on it.

They were installed and balanced on my car, but since then I’ve been experiencing a vibration from the front at higher speeds. I contacted the tire shop and they rebalanced the tires, but the vibration persisted. When I went back again, they suggested an alignment, even though there were no noticeable signs of alignment issues while driving. Should I get the alignment done just to satisfy their recommendation, and then go back if the vibration continues?

I also had the tires rebalanced at a different shop, which improved the situation somewhat, but the vibration is still there. For reference, this issue never occurred with the old tires, and the rims are not bent.

What should I do at this point—could this still be alignment-related, or is it more likely an issue with the new tires themselves?

Thank you.

The roads are all 65 mph speed limit state highways and interstates. Infact it's I70 through the mountains. After driving for 15 miles, I checked Reddit and to my horror I I got the information that these tires only last for 50 miles and if I try to go beyond that, there’s a high chance that this tire might fail. Reading this I had such a anxiety attack that I stopped and started looking for tire shops, but everything was closed. so the only option was to somehow limp back home and I tried to choose as many side roads and slower roads as possible and keep my speed around 25 mph on these smaller roads and 45 mph on the interstate and somehow made it back home.

Both examples are terrible ideas but point being the spare can usually survive a lot more than it says it can.

Make sure it is properly aired up to whatever it says to inflate it to on the side wall and keep the speed under control.  Keep in mind that you have a smaller contact patch with the road on that corner so hard braking or suddenly swerving is likely to break traction, plus ABS and traction control sometimes don't work right if the computer sees one tire spinning faster than the others (smaller diameter = more rotations per distance traveled).

1. i have this problem where the shiftgear move everytime i engage the clutch and it very prominent in first gear. laterly i start feeling it even at other gears.  
and when this happen i can feel that the whole car jerk a little bit , it feels like brutal shifting  ?  
is that a problem of my clutch or engine mount ?   
one note : sometimes the engine become a little bit shaky and you can feel the whole car is shaking out of nower and sometime it run smoothly.

2. how do i know that my cluch need to be replaced ? is there any signs ?  
lately i noticed that when i change the clutch at first gear the car shudder and almost stall and i have to lift my foot a little bit further than usual for the car to stop shaking.  
other thing, sometime i can't change to the first gear and have to move to the second gear and then back to first gear. but i t happen rarely. my car is 110k miles and i don't know if the previous owner did change the clutch.

We’re leaning towards a 2020–2022 Toyota Yaris because it’s affordable to insure, has good driver assist features, feels nice to drive, and has strong safety ratings. We’re planning to buy from an official Toyota dealership, since we don’t have enough knowledge to confidently buy from independent sellers and feel this would be a safer option for us.

A few beginner questions:

1. Tyres: How important are tyres for UK weather? Most of the used cars we’ve seen come with summer tyres. We’re in North Yorkshire, so lots of rain, some frost/ice in winter, but barely any snow. Is it risky to just keep summer tyres, or should we go for all-season/winter tyres straight away?

2. Finance: The Toyota dealership is offering 5.9% APR finance. Is this considered a good deal, or would we be better off getting a personal loan from a bank instead?

3. Service plan / warranty: Toyota offers a full service plan, and they extend the warranty up to 10 years if you service with them. Has anyone here gone for it? Is it actually worth the extra cost, or would an independent garage be smarter?

4. Price: Is the price at dealerships negotiable, or is that generally frowned upon?

AndyJWB (Score: 2): You’re not going to go wrong with a Yaris.

1. Most people stick with summer tyres but there are definite advantages to winter tyres when temperatures drop. I’d be inclined to switch to all-seasons when budget allows (or when the current tyres require replacing).

2. 5.9% is decent.

3. Toyotas are generally very reliable but the 10-year warranty is the best in the business. I’d pay Toyota labour rates for that.

4. I’ve never had much success haggling at main dealers. It’s worth a try, though - be nice about it (some people get weirdly aggressive at this point), ask what they can do and you might get a few hundred quid off or something chucked into the deal. Don’t bother paying for things like paint protection, although the dealer will be earning commission from selling finance, so that should be in your favour."

1nszhvz,What to buy or what to fix! Advice wanted!!,"My beloved 2013 Volvo V60 catastrophically died on me last week at 160,000 miles. The timing belt has gone and repair estimates are £2k. The car also requires other work which would push this up towards £4k. Garage is reluctant to fix it (at best). 

My first question is, is it worth fixing it given the age, mileage and additional work needed? 

I’m looking at other cars, but am struggling to work out what my best options are. So, my second question is: 

Which car would you suggest best meets the following needs:

£15k budget
Needs to be big enough for family of five (two adults, three almost teens), plus camping equipment and sports equipment (Scouts and rugby). 
Must be fuel efficient.
Able to handle long miles (my commute is 70 miles a day, plus a 240 round trip every other week). 
Would like the car to last as long as humanly possible (the V60 has done six years and I’ve put 120,000 miles on it). 
Can’t be electric/hybrid as we rent and have no charging facilities.

My previous four cars have been Volvos (this V60, a V40 and two V50s) and I do love them. However, the second hand market is a lot more pricey than I remember it being, so fear I’ve been priced out of a Volvo!

I’ve come across a 2012 Ford Fiesta 1.25 with 66k miles for £3,800 from a private dealer. The dealer’s online reviews look decent, and they’ve sent me a walk-around video of the car.

Would it be worth paying for a pre-purchase inspection (AA quoted me £216)? RAC might be cheaper. I’m leaning towards getting it delivered since it would save me a 6-hour round trip, and I feel like an in-person check from me wouldn’t add much beyond how it looks.And i’m nervous to be on the road with the unfamiliar route unfamiliar car.

Any advice would be appreciated!

I drive a MK1 Audi TT BAM APX.

I’m currently deciding between keeping my company car allowance or switching to a company EV.

My heart’s set on keeping my BMW M440i, but on paper, swapping to the company EV, a Kia EV6 GT (for some reason, they only offer Kia), makes a lot of financial sense. It’s fully paid for and maintained, plus they’re installing a home charger free of charge. My fuel bills would drop from around £800 per year to about £200 with Octopus.

If I invest the equity from selling the M440i and the monthly savings, it could potentially be worth an extra £130k over 15 years. Despite this, I’m really struggling with the switch. ICE vehicles are slowly being phased out and will likely become more expensive to own, which frustrates me. I’m finally at an age where I can afford my dream cars, with decent engines, but the EV push feels like it’s cutting that short.

Has anyone else made a similar switch and been glad they did?

Also, I’m worried about my no claims bonus (NCB) eventually expiring since the company will be paying the insurance.

Would this pose problems for a diesel engine and the dpf? Would the mpg be significantly lower than with a petrol? Or will the diesel engine be fine and I’m just overthinking it?

I’m going to view a car this week which is a 2009 Kia rio 3 (1.4 petrol) with 68k miles on it. It hasn’t had its cam belt changed and has no service history except for MOTs and the fact it’s had its subframe replaced 2 years ago. The seller says it’s his mothers car, and that his uncle is the one who has serviced it for the 5 years she’s owned it. It has had 5 owners from new, and MOT is until August 2026.

I let some air out of my tyres this morning so I could test it out as I’d only topped them up at the petrol station the other day. 

Rears should be on 2.1 and they read about 1.9 after I’d let some air out. I let a similar amount out the fronts also.

Right, so it’s down to two company EVs and I can’t pick (never owned or driven an EV before): 

	•	2025 Skoda Elroq SE L 85 
	•	2025 Kia EV3 81.4kWh 

Both claim 350 miles (so what, 250 if I don’t drive like my nan). Both will just about squeeze into my garage that was clearly designed for a Mk1 Fabia. Both sting me  about £40/month in BiK, so HMRC isn’t the tie-breaker.

1nsig3f,Admiral insurance switch to multicover,"Hi, I switched my admiral car insurance from standalone to multicover along with my house but realized just after renewal(3 days back) that the duration of the insurance after the switch makes it align with my house insurance so it's only until June 6th next year and not a full year as I expected. In the previous year I paid 1300£ and on multicover the quote was 860£ which seemed a bit cheaper as I considered it a full years quote but it's shorter by like 3.5 months which makes it about the same per month.

Just traded in a 23 plate (end of term). Overall very happy with it. Would do well as a family car BUT if you already have a buggy and car seat, ask if you could try it. Plenty of space in the boot (multi level floor, box underneath too) and decent headroom.

We found the build quality was good, and didn't have any issues other than the mandated recall stuff (so make sure those have been done).

Ancient_Farmer7543 (Score: 5): I've driven one and had use of one for an extended period of time. Ignore the comments here about ""ecoboom"" engines. This refers to a now discontinued version of the engine that used a wet cam belt system, whereby the timing belt ran through the engine oil. Engines from around 2020 onwards, including nearly all mild hybrid 1.0 Ford Puma's have a timing chain. They still have a ""wet"" oil pump belt but there's no evidence yet of these suffering premature failure. They changed the materials on these oil pump belts too from earlier engines. In any case, an oil pump is under significant less stress than a timing belt, so I wouldn't be hugely concerned by this.

People just regurgitate the stuff they read/watch on the internet without bothering to look up the actually details..

As for the car, they're perfectly fine and capable as small family cars. For your budget, you would struggle to get the 155 ps version of the 1.0, which is the better engine. However, the difference between the 125ps and 155ps are minimal. The 155 ps has a bit of extra power that helps with joining off a slip road etc but the 125 ps is still more than capable for daily use.

The boot is a good size, although it does have a load lip. Rear set space is tight for adults but would be fine for kids. Ford have a habit of bundling the things you might want such as a reversing camera in optional extra packs. This means some of the basic trim levels can feel a bit Spartan but they still give you most of the essentials you need.

You'll also get a lot of people piping in about the Puma having not driven one. Ignore those comments as the car handles very well for something in this class. It's still a small SUV/crossover, so it's limited by its height and weight. But unlike almost anything else you can still chuck it into a corner on a twist road and it feels like it's capable. Ford have a history tuning their  car's handling and steering very well.

Build quality has a lot to be desired. Ford car's have a history of not feeling well put together. So expect some cabin rattles etc and potentially other misc issues.

Overall, I'd say the Puma is one of the strongest cars in the class. Maybe that doesn't say much given the competition but for 13k you should be able to get a 2022/23 model with around 20-40k miles on depending on trim levels.

A couple things to note, 200 or even 300 a month is roughly what a lot of beginners would be paying for their first couple years of driving if they passed at 17-18 ish, and as you're paying monthly it will be higher than if you paid the total amount in full so the amount is reasonable depending on what car you want. So for this it's best if you could maybe get a parent or another family member to possibly loan you the amount so that it's cheaper overall, and then pay them back monthly.

There's quite a few important factors that determines how much they might quote you, this includes:

Vehicle - Cars such as Ford Fiestas and Vauxhall Corsa or any other popular first car should be avoided as they are likely to be high risk due to the number of claims/statistics of young people crashing. Try to get something that is uncommon such as old volvos, “old man cars” and family cars, and in terms of BHP you won't necessarily get a lower quote for a less powerful car so don't be afraid to go for something that might be a bit more powerful than what most people go for.

Additional driver - having both parents and if possible grandparents on your policy would usually drive down your insurance costs, but this is not always the case.

Location - this refers to where the car will be parked and if you happen to live in a high risk area with high rates of claims or crime you’re going to be expecting high costs, examples include Birmingham, Bradford.

Another thing is that if you're using online comparison websites without hiding your IP or Personal Details they will end up giving you bs quotes as they don't want you to keep trying different cars to ""play the system"" and attempt to get a lower insurance quote, in the end giving you an inflated amount than you would've originally got. I suggest creating a second account and using different names and a different house number on the same street you're on whilst keeping everything else the same (age, vehicle, additional drivers etc), this way you can get a rough idea on how much a reasonable quote for the vehicle you want would be. 

Once you've found a car that has reasonable insurance or at least an amount that you're willing to pay, then call up the cheapest company and ask for a quote for that car with your real details. The reason you call up is because it would be considered a ""fresh quote"" in a sense, and a lot of the times you can also negotiate with the insurance salesman as they can give certain discounts but by company policy they can't if you don't ask for it.

Do keep in mind, after going through all this you might still get a bullshit quote, because insurance companies just pull numbers out their ass. 

Feel free to message if you have any questions.
