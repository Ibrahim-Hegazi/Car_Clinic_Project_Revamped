1mwr66l,2006 Jeep Wrangler AC trouble.,"I just bought this vehicle a couple months ago and parked it right after I bought it for roughly 3 months. Everything was perfect when I bought it. I got it running after a battery replacement and to my surprise the AC was smoking when I started driving but only from under the glove compartment. It’s more of a sweet smoke, not really plastic smoke. However, as soon as I turn off the AC, it stops smoking. Even if I have the AC cranked while idling at my house,no smoke in the engine bay, no smoke in the cabin. As soon as I start driving with the AC on the smoke reappears. The AC won’t blow while I’m idling. 

I did a fluid fill undercoat when I bought it and got some overspray on the exhaust which burned off pretty quickly when I first started it up so I just assumed that’s where the smoke was coming from but it still happening.

1mwqtam,Did I say something wrong or is this mechanic just weird?,"I (f20s) decided it was time to replace my front brake pads, so I called up a local shop that had good reviews. He owns his own business. I've mostly had bad experiences with mechanics (they treat me like an airhead, talk down to me, or ignore me and talk to my boyfriend about my car even though I'm the one paying). Because of this, mechanics make me anxious and i prefer to do my own oil changes or repairs. I was feeling really optimistic about this guy though. I just wanted a quote and was planning on asking for the soonest appointment.

When this mechanic picked up the phone, I explained that I'd like to know how much it would cost to replace just the brake pads, per axle. He asked ""Front or back?"" and I said ""I guess the front for now!"". He condescendingly said ""You GUESS?"" I thought he probably deals with rude customers all day so I stayed polite. I explained I just wanted to address the front brakes for now and I would handle the rear brakes later. I also told him my car's year/make/model.

He asked for my license plate, which I gave to him, but he said it was a weird format and kept asking me if I was reading it correctly. I offered to give him my VIN instead, which he agreed to. Before I had a chance to read it to him, he explained he needed either the plate or the VIN to accurately give me a price estimate. I told him I understood, and as a side note, asked how much it might be if I brought my own brake pads if he accepts customer parts. He said, no he doesn't accept customer parts, and then abruptly said that another customer was calling and hung up on me.

Was I breaking some kind of unspoken rule? Or was I being rude/unreasonable? I know some mechanics accept customer parts so I thought there was no harm in asking. I wasn't trying to waste his time either. Since I haven't gone to a mechanic in a while I'm not sure if i was crossing some sort of line or being annoying. I was feeling pretty bad about it after and debated calling him back to clear up any miscommunication but decided against it ultimately.

Most every mechanic should be between 1 and 2 hours. (75x2=150) Labor hours plus parts—the parts price is only a few clicks away at RockAuto.com.

1mwqqzn,"Brake line job taking 8+ days, am I over reacting?","Need some advice and guidence on what to do 

So I'm getting all 4 brake lines done on my 09 Hyundai accent. I brought it in last Wednesday and they told me it would be done this Wednesday (it is now Thursday). They told me they no longer know when my car is going to be done because it's ""r*sty"" and the tech is working on it in between other jobs. They keep telling me it's on the lift still and not to worry but I have never been in this situation where I feel like they're giving me the run around. 

My question is what happened to my appointment for this? Why is he working on it between other cars? 

I know my vehicle is r*sty (r*st belt) but there's no holes and it's significantly less rusty than my last vehicle which had 3 holes in the rocker panels and they did brake lines on that thing in one day. I also get that things can break and the calipers might need doing and something about the wheel cylinders so I get we already stripped bolts ourselves and had to mess around with that when we put in a new starter but we were able to navigate that within one day just in our drive way I would assume a shop has the tools on hand to address any of those issues coming up 

My fiance has been steady working on tuning up this vehicle since my last one is obviously not great and yeah it's rusty but hasn't given him any more grief than any other vehicle in this area. I even got the timing belt done on it when I bought it and that was only a day in the shop. My fiance recently did tie rods, struts, and ball joints on the whole front end. 

At this point I don't know what to do or say to them and I need my car back because next week is orientation for school. Any advice is much appreciated.

1mwqmkz,My New Volvo XC90 Feels Unsafe,"Hi, I've had a 2024 Volvo XC90 Recharge for about six months. I am concerned that something is seriously wrong with it. The car has about 5,000 miles on it and has never been in an accident. We live in a city and usually make short distance trips. This summer on a longer family trip, I noticed that the back of the car swayed slightly right and left every time I drove over a small bump or pothole especially at higher speeds. The passengers did not notice the swaying. Concerned about driving my kids in the car, I took it to the Volvo service for a closer inspection. They returned the car back to me the same day and assured that everything was fine. We made several long distance trips and while I did not feel the swaying much, it still felt a bit off - for lack of a better word. My husband took over driving responsibilities because I was still feeling a bit nervous about it. Two days ago, we got a pressure alert, and upon inspection there was damage on the wheels. Roadside Assistance confirmed that the back wheels were showing extreme wear and tear, and their internal structure was exposed. The technician pointed out a large split on the passenger side with exposed cords. The driver’s side was also worn down and developing a split. The technician immediately suggested that something was wrong and it was a ""lawsuit waiting to happen"". He said it this was a time bomb situation and we were lucky. I was shook up by what I had heard, especially because I had taken the car for inspection just three weeks ago. The car is now at the dealer and we have not heard from them for two days despite multiple calls and messages. The person who answers the calls said they were trying to ""get the car to an alignment"", and that they did not have any loaner cars that they could offer. Not sure what this all means, but we are frustrated and not sure whether we should trust the dealer or even the manufacturer. Any advice is appreciated!

Its also a massive pain in the ass to get the drain hoses reconnected on most cars. Once you get them reconnected, check them for being plugged. If they are, water will back up and pour in from the sunroof.

Wait unit the car is cold, and use pliers on that hose clamp to squeeze the tabs together, and slip it toward the hose about an inch.  Then remove the hose by pulling it. You may have to twist the hose to get it started.  Now you can check that hose connection on the tank.  You'll probably find it broken.  If it's alright, then the hose probably has a split toward the end.

Replacing either part or both can be a DIY repair with some common hand tools.

AC is not functional.
Broken bolts are lodged in the block.
No local shops want to take on the job.

Question #2 - So in April, my oil cap had gone missing after an oil change. Oil spilled, replaced oil and cap immediately. About a month later, check engine light came on, no driving issues. Got the code read and it was cat code, still with no driving issues. 

I had a mechanic come look at it. He said downstream o2 sensor wasn’t reading right. Started having sluggishness when accelerating, low mileage, auto stop/start not always working. Did 2 bottles of cataclean and new downstream o2 sensor. The old one was completely stripped and my car has been driving normally with no issues. Mileage improved etc. He said there were temp and pending codes he cleared, couldn’t clear the permanent code, and there had been a bunch of misfires recorded. He cleared the temp and pending code, light went away. 30 miles later it came back on. He said he thinks cat is totally fine, suggested premium to help clear misfires, etc. 

Coworkers husband looked at it today and he said cat is definitely fine. He said fuel injector could help given the oil situation so he added that. He also said it could be an engine issue from the oil spill. car is driving normal. No sounds or smells. Total mileage range went from 420 to 465 since he added injector and I filled up on premium. I’ve driven about 40 miles since the additive and premium & light is still on.

I just had the front lower control Arms assembly replaced, front and rear sway bar bushings and front brakes and rotors, then alignment. Alignment shop seems sketchy, mechanic who did repairs didn't give me a report and said it was done free of charge. The alignment place didn't have one for me either when I asked.  Immediately after the work was done, like the next day, I started hearing this noise sometimes when I am turning left.  Original mechanic and alignment shop both did test drive again for me and said they didn't hear anything.  Could it be issues with the control arm assembly?  Brake shield bent during the work and rubbing something? Sway bar links were reused for control arms, I would have preferred they were replaced but didn't know about this until afterwards. Tie rod end?  Was something was damaged during the work done by mechanic or alignment? Or a whole new coincidental problem? 

Should I have another shop look at it? I booked something but of course there is a $100 fee for the diagnostic appt. Or watch and wait until I am due for the next oil change, or it gets louder and more frequent?

1mwn0a3,Serious issue with carburetor/alternator/fuse box assembly — urgent advice needed,"Hello all,

I’m currently experiencing a serious mechanical issue that I haven’t been able to find any clear documentation on. The carburetor, which appears to have been mounted directly onto the alternator, is somehow interconnected with the fuse box located beneath the skid steer but simultaneously mounted above the dump truck frame.

This entire assembly seems to have entered a state of severe mechanical failure. The system produces oscillatory vibrations of such intensity that it feels like the components are actively working against one another. Upon ignition attempts, the unit emits an extremely irregular noise that I can only compare to a deep gargling resonance — almost as though the system is cavitating internally.

At this point, the overall structural integrity seems compromised, and I am genuinely concerned about continued operation. I am unsure whether this falls under the expertise of a mechanic, an engineer, or perhaps a specialist in complex system integration. My greatest concern is that continued stress on the assembly could result in a catastrophic failure event that compromises not only the drivability but the safety of the vehicle itself.

If anyone has encountered a similar failure involving this type of carburetor–alternator–fuse box–skid steer–dump truck configuration, please provide any guidance. I am treating this as a legitimate safety issue and would appreciate serious input.

No, and for two reasons.

There are usually wires, and sometimes modules under the carpet. Anything spilled (especially a lot of it) should be soaked up and cleaned up as fast as possible, especially something like this which will eat through those wires.

Secondly, battery acid is **toxic**, so that's going to be a lot of fumes in the car you do NOT want to breathe in.

But when I checked the computer it says its for a Dodge Nitro. I also looked up what happens if the computer is bad and apparently if he put the wrong computer in the vehicle it won't do anything at all, it must be programmed to that vehicle. Anyways, turns out all the vehicle needed was a crank sensor wired back because apparently the wires melted and broke it.

Anyways I say that because I am not sure if thats the problem or not, I am no mechanic. The vehicle drives and shifts perfectly fine. If I am at a stop light and I accelerate it works as intended, no issues. However if I try to hold it steady between 1300-1600 rpms and 30-45 mph it shakes it feels like its shaking in the rear. Now as soon as i take my foot off the gas it stops shaking. Again I am no mechanic but I would think if its the tires, wouldn't it shake as its accelerating even if I am not holding it steady? or wouldn't it continue to shake even for a couple of seconds after I took my foot off the gas?

Oh also the cruise doesn't work, the BAS ESP, Traction & ABS lights are on but oddly enough the check engine light is not on, it was on when I got it but after I fixed the issues its not come back on and the oil light dings on sometimes while driving.

It looks a bit low from the picture but not totally flat. It may ""just"" be a slow leak. You need to pump it up to pressure and see how much air it's lost relative to the others. 

Take a spray bottle with soapy water and spray it on the bent part. If it bubbles its leaking. 

Sometimes a wheel will bend but the bead will stay sealed (the seal between the innermost lip of the tire that makes contact with the wheel and the wheel is the bead).

You can monitor the rate of air loss with an analog pressure gauge. You should also carry a 12v portable tire pump with you. If the car sits a while, check the pressure to see if it went down relative to the other tires (through the bubbles from the soapy water will tell you if you have a leak). While youre driving, the tire increases in temp and slow leaks will become even slower or stop completely.

Car - Peugeot 3008 Active (2012 Model) Was being a dickhead speeding through country lanes when I didn’t see a sharp corner and went flying over a ditch, though a wire fence, and into a farmers field. Ended up having to get a tow and haven’t told my dad anything yet just told him I’m staying round my friend (passenger’s) house. Drove back to his house after at 2am.

Damage- One tire was popped (ordered a replacement matching to arrive at 4pm today), the steering is pulling very heavily to the left, the bottom bumper has come off (just plastic bit which you can see under the wheel in the photo), engine feels like it’s struggling a little bit because I can hear the engine feeling like it needs to be switched up a gear earlier than normal and possibly the brakes feeling a bit off.

But the main issue at the moment is I can still smell a bit of a burnt/smokey smell coming from the engine and am wondering if it is even okay to drive to the mechanics, or to pick up the tire. Do you guys know what the smell is likely to be caused by and what main issues I could get repaired without my dad clocking, or just any help in general, thank you if you’ve got anything stressing a lot at the moment

1mw76iz,Alignment Questions,"2025 Ram 1500 Big Horn crew cab 4x4 3.6.

I noticed at time of purchase that it felt like the truck drifted/pulled to the right when driving. I mentioned it on the test drove with the salesman and also let him know after driving it home that night (1+ hour ride) that I felt it on different roads and at different speeds. Mentioned to him I would give it a week or so and see if it settled out, and get back in touch after that if I felt it needed to be checked.

I ended up doing a 2 inch level and also replaced the tires to get a slightly taller sidewall. Went from 275/55r20 to 275/65r20. Right after the installation and mount, I went and got an alignment done from an independent shop.

I just drove the vehicle about 700 miles to the northeast across 6 states for a work trip. I notice that in order to drove straight, I feel like the steering wheel is ever so slightly turned to the left. When I let go, the wheel gradually straightens itself out, but the truck pulls pretty noticeably to the right at that point. The steering wheel offset is minor. While I do feel it's not exactly center/balanced, its do also recognize it could just be my OCD. The pull to the right is also minor ish while holding the wheel, not like im using muscle to fight it. But when I let go the pull does in fact gradually drift me into the right lane.

Questions:
1. Attached is my alignment report. Does anything stand out in there on what may be causing this?
2. Ill end up driving probably about 2000 miles this week. If something is slightly off with my alignment based on the description I shared above, is 2k miles enough to do any premature damage to my tires? They are brand new, so would hate to cause premature wear to them already on this one single trip.
3. Are variances like this in pull and steering normal with larger tires on a truck? These put me at just about 34.2 inch tires with a 2 inch level.

goose-77- (Score: 8): It’s the swaybar end link and it’s perfectly safe to drive without it (many cars don’t have swaybars) but the car will handle differently. The swaybar ties the two wheels together (front left to front right, rear left to rear right) to stop body roll around corners. The end links tie the end of the swaybar to the suspension. It’s worth replacing and can be done in 20 minutes; it’s just two bolts/nuts per side.

From the looks of it, the joint has separated (which will be the popping sound) and it’s likely still attached to the car.

This is what it should look like although the one they’ve replaced it with is an adjustable end link (the bar in the middle can be rotated to extend the link to preload the swaybar), which you likely won’t need, just get a direct replacement from your local auto parts store.

1mwqwfg,Control Arm Bushing Seized,"Hi all, I have a 2014 Honda Pilot. I'm trying to remove the passenger side control arm. I managed to get every other bolt out - all seized - but the control arm ball joint is severely seized. I had to cut the castle nut off because no amount of heat or penetrant would loosen it and eventually I simply stripped the castle nut trying with a breaker bar. So I cut it off, which means there's not a lot of threaded end sticking out of the knuckle to apply pressure with a ball joint separator; I tried but nothing. I have heated the joint and wailed on the knuckle with a sledge to no avail. I've tried doing it with the rotor lifted up  to near horizontal and without support. I have tried a pickle fork hammered all the way in and even stood on the damn thing, again to no avail.  I could cut the boot off and heat the shank from below but that's my last thoughts

Any thoughts? The castle nut was rusted all to hell. I'm obviously replacing the control arm. Do I cut it at the bushing and then drill out the knuckle? Or do I give up and take it somewhere. I'm looking at a shop rate of $145 / hour and honestly it's maybe 30 min to put it back together once damn thing is free but I might not be able to put it back together as is so might also need to have it towed.

I then started the car, and of course, you must have the clutch pressed in to do this. Once it was started, the gear shift was in neutral, and no noise with the clutch pedal fully pressed... I went to release the clutch to let it idle, but heard the same scraping noise just as I began to release the clutch and it remained making the same scraping noise with the pedal fully released

I have attached a audio file of the scraping noise that appears when I begin to release the clutch and have it fully released.

1mwlr4m,Vehicle sometimes requires jump only after long drive,"I have a '91 Chevy G20 van. It had it's engine replaced but I don't expect that to be relevant to my problem.

Over the last few years, I've had numerous long drives, 18+ hour trips (back and forth a few times between SoCal and Seattle, WA; Seattle to Wyoming and back).

Occasionally during these trips after driving for a few hours, I'll stop for gas then immediately need a jump start where it will start up fine. This only occurs after driving for hours, usually about 3+, but not always. I needed 1 jump from Seattle to Wyoming, but 3 on the return trip. I needed 2 from CA to WA. There was one incident I can recall that I needed a jump after driving for about 45 minutes followed by 30 minutes of idling while waiting in a line. I never need a jump when not traveling or when only doing daily city driving.

When I need a jump, dash lights come on, nothing clicks and there's not attempt to start which leads me to think battery. But, battery was replaced 3 years ago and still is within warranty periods. I also get appropriate voltages on the battery while off (~12.6) and running (~14.2).

Admittedly I haven't replaced the battery or tested it, but I can't see it being a battery issues cause it starts and runs flawless when not driving a distance.

1mwk18f,testing for parasitic drain? or other electrical issue.,"Hey guys. I'm still working a problem that I've posted in here before. I have questions.

My car is a 1997 Dodge ram and it won't start at all. When I try to crank it, all power dies. Brand new battery that consistently tests good and fully charged so it isn't the battery.  
  
 I was wondering if you can use a test light to detect a parasitic drain in a car from the late 90's. There isn't much electrical stuff in the car, but it does have power windows for example, and of course a computer. I disconnected battery negative cable and hooked up the test light. it burns very brightly. but when I did the same test with a multimeter I get a reading of basically zero milliamps draw. So is my multimeter messed up or is the test light just the wrong tool for this ...? 

Also, I did a min-max on the battery while trying to turn over the car. It revealed that the battery dropped to 0 volts?! All power dead to the car. All lights/dash is dead. But after about a minute, the power comes back and the battery is showing 12.7 volts?! 

just in case i did pull all the fuses with the test light hooked up. it never went off. i disconnected the alternator and the light never went off. so maybe the light isn't doing anything. my final thought is maybe the starter is grounding out somehow?

I ended up finding a used transmission locally with around 16k miles with proof it was running before the car got totaled. I bought it off an older folk who was going to use it for his 65 coyote swap but the trans was too big for his  tunnel and he ended up keeping just the motor itself.

So I got the shop to install it for me, obviously no warranty, it was at my own risk. 2 days go by they call me with bad news, claimed the transmission was no good.

In preparation for the tune we had replaced the fuel pump. Bought one of ebay for cheap and we think it might have been a knock off because the low pressure fuel line  didn't slide into the fuel pump normally like it would on an oem even though the part number was the same. 

After the install, it was fine for a while but after I drove it hard we noticed a rattling sound but didn't pin it to the fuel pump. A while later I get the tune installed and am driving it and start to notice the rattle getting worse. Eventually, the car starts to go into protective mode and limit the rpm. When we check the fuel pump the bolts snapped. 

Ordered a new fuel pump and installed it. Now the car feels  a little slower. 

Is the engine damaged? Was the old pump delivering more fuel and causing it to feel faster? Injectors clogged?

1mwg1fo,Is a second repair estimate worth it? Body shop asking ~$40k vs $5700 estimate from StateFarm,"\[2021 BMW 330Xi\] I had this car accident (right t-bone into the front quarter) 2 weeks ago and StateFarm estimated \~$5700 of repairs based only on the picture below. Which is mainly cosmetic plus replacing both the front door and quarter with non-OEM parts (which is fine to me). However, I knew there were some mechanic damages too, as the front wheel was slight bent inward and I could sense something wrong when steering.   
Two days ago, the body shop where I towed the car sent out their estimate to SF and it skyrocketed to \~40k. I called them for more information but they gave me just a generic answer saying there is a problem with the suspension.   
Even if the whole suspension system must be replaced, does it justify more than $30k from the estimate? I just found out that this body shop charges out-of-market prices because it is the only one BMW certified in the Chicago area and most of their cars are RR, Bentley and other exotic cars.   
Would you recommend to tow the car (at my expenses) to a trusted body shop for a second estimate? Just to have the chance to avoid a total loss and have the car repaired.

1mwfyyw,Would you recommend a new transmission?,"I have a **2018 Infiniti Q50 at 94000 miles with an automatic transmission**. **Transmission fluid was last replaced at 30000 miles**. I'm not sure of the engine size. I have had this intermittent issue where a ""Warning - Malfunction"" light will flash on the display, and then it becomes very **difficult to accelerate the car**, although it's still drivable. It feels like I'm driving in neutral. This has probably happened **5 times** total over the span of 5 months, but it has become more frequent. The first time it occurred, I thought it was just a glitch, and nothing else happened for 2 or 3 more months. The most recent three times have all been about a week apart. I was also gone for 1.5 months (June - mid July), so the car wasn't in use. These instances probably would have happened during that time if I had been there to drive it. 

I noticed that when this did happen, it typically happened right before I got gas, when I was near empty. I did a little bit of research and thought it may have been a minor fuel pump issue that wouldn't occur if I didn't let the gas get so low. I stated refilling gas whenever I hit 1/4 tank instead of waiting until it was nearer to empty. However, this warning light + difficult acceleration issue occurred again yesterday when I was at a half tank, not near empty, so I immediately brought it to a transmission shop.

They said they were going to check the **valve body and transmission**. The error code they pulled from the car was **P1721**. They said it was either going to be just a valve body/TCM issue or a whole transmission issue, hopefully just a valve body issue. They would know after they dropped the pan to check the transmission. However, when they checked the pan, the **fluid was murky brown/black/grey** and there were **small metal shavings (no large metal pieces)**. They **recommended transmission replacement**. They said that the sluggish acceleration while driving the car (they drove it) and pan findings point to torque converter contamination and an internal problem with the transmission. I called a relative who knows more about cars than me and they agreed. 

**Is this a reasonable course of action**? Unfortunately I had my own time pressure when this occurred yesterday afternoon because I needed to ensure that I would have transportation to work early this morning. They said if they just refilled the transmission fluid and gave it back to me (yesterday) they'd have to charge me for that, and putting new fluid in a malfunctioning transmission wouldn't be great for the transmission. They ensured they could get me a rental car, which they did, and I signed for the repair. However, this morning I did more research, got very nervous, and asked them to release my car so I could get a second opinion. They said they can't because they already started taking the transmission out and the new transmission is already on the way. Since they've already ordered the new transmission and it'll arrive tomorrow, I would have to pay for whatever return fee would be + fees that the transport company would charge. I just want to know if their findings warrant transmission replacement or only valve body replacement and whether my experience sounds normal and up to par. If it matters, I am a woman. Thanks in advance for your help, and sorry for the long post.",1,1755794017.0,2,AskMechanics,1755891187,2025-08-21 16:33:37,2025-08-22 19:33:07,"sexandliquor (Score: 2): It sounds like you do need a new transmission yes. 

The fluid is dark and black like that because the transmission has been damaged internally and burnt up. 

All those times when you were driving it and the RPMs would go way up and it felt like you were driving in neutral? That was the transmission slipping. 

You might have been able to have a better/easier/cheaper outcome if you had stopped driving it as soon as you could then and had it diagnosed. It may have been a valve body/TCM problem then. But it snowballed into a worse problem which is where you are now."

1mw77r8,Alignment Questions,"2025 Ram 1500 Big Horn crew cab 4x4 3.6.

I noticed at time of purchase that it felt like the truck drifted/pulled to the right when driving. I mentioned it on the test drove with the salesman and also let him know after driving it home that night (1+ hour ride) that I felt it on different roads and at different speeds. Mentioned to him I would give it a week or so and see if it settled out, and get back in touch after that if I felt it needed to be checked.

I ended up doing a 2 inch level and also replaced the tires to get a slightly taller sidewall. Went from 275/55r20 to 275/65r20. Right after the installation and mount, I went and got an alignment done from an independent shop.

I just drove the vehicle about 700 miles to the northeast across 6 states for a work trip. I notice that in order to drove straight, I feel like the steering wheel is ever so slightly turned to the left. When I let go, the wheel gradually straightens itself out, but the truck pulls pretty noticeably to the right at that point. The steering wheel offset is minor. While I do feel it's not exactly center/balanced, its do also recognize it could just be my OCD. The pull to the right is also minor ish while holding the wheel, not like im using muscle to fight it. But when I let go the pull does in fact gradually drift me into the right lane.

Questions:
1. Attached is my alignment report. Does anything stand out in there on what may be causing this?
2. Ill end up driving probably about 2000 miles this week. If something is slightly off with my alignment based on the description I shared above, is 2k miles enough to do any premature damage to my tires? They are brand new, so would hate to cause premature wear to them already on this one single trip.
3. Are variances like this in pull and steering normal with larger tires on a truck? These put me at just about 34.2 inch tires with a 2 inch level.

Installation: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hkuUCeLu1MZqKvgzRVYpw62M6qTVOT5C/view

Book time is 2.5 hours.

General pointers:

- If you've done brakes and suspension work before, that's most of the job up to popping out the axle.
- Generally, a couple pry bars, placed on opposite sides between the inboard joint and transmission housing, are sufficient to pop the shaft out, but a slide hammer and CV shaft adapter might come in handy (you can probably rent the tool from a national chain retail parts store).
- You need to be careful when removing and installing the axle to not damage the seal around the shaft in the transmission.
- If you accidentally pull one of the joints apart, you should be able to get it lined back up without any issue and push back in.
- When inserting the inner shaft into the transmission, you may need to hold the axle straight and give it a good push inwards by collapsing both joints to get the lock clip seated. You should get a good firm indication that the joint is all the way in.
- Axle nut needs to be torqued properly (217 lbf is the torque spec for 2011 Camry) with a half inch drive torque wrench (you'll want a long, sturdy pry bar or something, placed between two wheel studs on one end and the other end on the ground to lock the wheel hub in place while torquing).
- The outer shaft sometimes can be quite difficult to free from the hub splines. Remove the axle nut and try to get the outer shaft starting to push in through the hub early to gauge how easy it will go later (you just want to see some free movement ideally, and hopefully not a rock solid shaft). The end of the shaft usually has a divot where you can place a large pointed punch to hammer it through, or (since you're replacing it anyway) you can hammer directly on the end of the shaft, being careful to not hit anything else and with the old axle nut on flush with the end of the shaft to help prevent mushrooming. Sometimes they push right out, sometimes they need to be heated with torches, sometimes they need to be removed with the knuckle and pressed out due to rust/corrosion, and once in my time I've had to just replace the knuckle and bearing because they were so fused together. If you're unable to get any movement, you'll probably want to abandon course and bring to a shop.

You can put anti-seize or moly brake grease on the splines of the outer shaft and hub to avoid rust issues in the future, but make sure to keep the threads clean and free of any kind of lubrication.

A couple specific notes on the procedures I linked:

- You don't necessarily need to drain transmission fluid, but expect some to come out when you pull the inner shaft out of the transmission.
- The wheel speed sensor might give you a hard time coming out of the knuckle, so you might want to free it from the other end (unplug the connector, and unbolt/unclip any brackets between the connector and the sensor end). You'll want as much movement out of the knuckle as you can get, and don't want to damage the sensor or its wiring.
- The procedure shows both driver and passenger sides, so if you're only doing one then skip the step for the side you don't need. Replacing only one CV shaft is completely fine.

Realistic-March-5679 (Score: 1): Jiggle in and out is not necessarily a sign they are bad. They will have some extension in and out. Any up and down movement in the joint would be a failure though. Don’t confuse it with the normal movement of the joint though since it can bend if the wheel isn’t secured. Clicking while turning is usually a worn/damaged CV joint. If you do the whole axle it’s not too difficult to replace. Have some spare transmission fluid in case it leaks some. If you want to do just the affected joint it’s a little more involved and very messy. But if you have a solid vice, brass drifts, and a big hammer still quite doable."
1mw61zl,How to extend/space my exhaust flange?,"Hi,

So this may be a really dumb idea but I figure it was worth trying.

I drive a Toyota Celica (2ZZE-GE) and last week a small piece of pipe (which seemed to be badly repaired earlier on in it's life) had rusted off from the midpipe. The piece in question was after the cat and the resonator, the cat and the resonator were/are still good so instead of buying a complete new midpipe section I decided to try and repair the pipe, I figured it was worth trying since I know my way about the equipment needed (I am a mechanical engineering student).
Anyway, so me and a buddy of mine grinded and cleaned the original midpipe sections, bought a pipe with smaller diameter, fitted it in, placed the pipes over it and welded it back together at the right angle. I managed to fix the midpipe and I was proud! Bolted back the muffler and went driving again.

Now I heard some vibrations, so I went to check them out. The muffler pipe was banging/rattling against the control arm (sometimes) because it is now hanging like 10 mm or maybe 15 mm to far to the front of the car. 
Seems like I grinded a bit too much of material of of the midsection pipes.

For now I cheated it by taping the rattling part with ehat resistant cord which mutes/damps the vibrations but I don't like this fix.

To fix this i need to find a way to make the muffler hang back further again.
The pictured I added resembles my flange between the midpipe and the muffler. It is this section where I was thinking of adding something in-between to add the missing mm's. The thing is, i don't really know what, I can't seem to find thicker gaskets.
I could add a extra loose flange but I'm afraid it will leak so i need anthoer gasket than.
Than again, by adding the extra space I may also need longer bolts which I also couldn't find. Or would it be okay to just use any bolt?
What would be the best way to extend/space this section if feasible at all??

Or should i just give up and save up some money to buy a brand new midpipe and let the cat and resonator go to waste?

1mwbahy,"Kia/Hyundai nylon (push lock?) fuel line replacement options, (including AN)","Hello all - I am currently looking at my options to replace the high pressure fuel feed line and quick release connector seen centered in the main and second photo - the one that’s currently split at the barbed quick release fitting. It looks like nylon line, but the weave visible in the split looks more like thin braded pushlock.

This is a 2009(8) Kia Sorento BL with the Lambda I. It is MPFI and not GDI (it would have probably pumped its oil rings full of carbon by now if it were the latter) - this line goes to the fuel rail and there is no high pressure pump on the cam.

The line itself is NLA though generic QR fittings are still available all over the place on the aftermarket. Note, however, that the other end is push fit onto the hard feed line and not quick release. Clearly made for speedy installation of the entire hard line with flexible ends on the assembly line, not for servicing. While I’ve seen a few tutorials that show using a pipe barb clamp and a heat gun to fit nylon line onto their barbed plastic QR fittings, I’m concerned that doing it in-situ in the inner fender will be a nightmare, and not really advisable. What’s more, if there’s one line like this, the rest are all at risk from age too - thus I need a viable solution I can use to conceivably replace all the existing lines.

I’m no stranger to with enthusiast-level (read = hot rod) high-pressure (should we be saying mid-pressure with the advent of GDI systems?) EFI systems, but these are barbed systems with FI clamps or AN lines.

Put simply, I’m not as familiar with nylon and I’m also peeved at the general lack of serviceability of the design at the hard line (not at the quick release, that’s fine).

However, as a member of the build-your-car community - and one who generally rejects things under the hood made for assembly over serviceability - I’m curious if anyone has experience and can opine upon the feasibility of using a (quality) AN collet-style compression adapter on the hard line - one of the fittings I do not have prior experience with. I see Earl’s and the other Usual Suspects have these (and quick release versions too), but given how much of this stuff is used for low-pressure carbureted stuff, I wanted to ask around to get an idea of its feasibility for a 50-80psi MPFI system. And yes, I know this may be metric fuel line and I must keep that in mind as well.

Car - Peugeot 3008 Active (2012 Model) Was being a dickhead speeding through country lanes when I didn’t see a sharp corner and went flying over a ditch, though a wire fence, and into a farmers field. Ended up having to get a tow and haven’t told my dad anything yet just told him I’m staying round my friend (passenger’s) house. Drove back to his house after at 2am.

Damage- One tire was popped (ordered a replacement matching to arrive at 4pm today), the steering is pulling very heavily to the left, the bottom bumper has come off (just plastic bit which you can see under the wheel in the photo), engine feels like it’s struggling a little bit because I can hear the engine feeling like it needs to be switched up a gear earlier than normal and possibly the brakes feeling a bit off.

But the main issue at the moment is I can still smell a bit of a burnt/smokey smell coming from the engine and am wondering if it is even okay to drive to the mechanics, or to pick up the tire. Do you guys know what the smell is likely to be caused by and what main issues I could get repaired without my dad clocking, or just any help in general, thank you if you’ve got anything stressing a lot at the moment

Our car recently failed it's MOT out of blue with dangerous defecfs. Old Qashqai + 2 120k miles - which we've sunk a lot of money into, repairs are more than it's value - so it's time to say goodbye.

Got 3x kids and 4th on way in literally a couple of weeks. Desperately need a new car asap.

Found the Dacia Jogger as our preferred choice for a 7 seater. We wanted a new modern car with all our issues with previous car needing tons of repairs, ideally automatic hybrid for hilly Sheffield and city driving.

So up one pops at local Dacia dealer. 2024 automatic hybrid model, the terracotta we wanted, the top range extreme model rrp 25k for same price as a brand new mid tier essentials 20k.

Can't believe our luck. Only thing is it's 2000 miles used which raised eyebrows about why it was returned. Asked the dealer and he says it's 'ex motability owner may have passed away.' Morbid but I'm not superstitious.

We go for test drive and I immediately notice it smells a bit musty. Wife and kids don't notice and there's very subtly discolouration on the fabric. Other than that drives well and cars a perfect fit.

I asked if owner was a smoker and turns out my nose was right. They assured me the smell would fade over time, and that theyd been airing it out and changed the cabin air filter. Even recommending some odor bombs you can find online.

So frustrating... getting a next to new car instantly vs. the 6-8 month waiting list but worried this issue is going to plague us. On a hot day the smell may get worse for instance.

Any recommendations for smoke smell or what to do? Is a 25-20k reduction good enough for a low milage next to new car? Any good ways to test the smoke smell?

Reliability wise it’s great, most of the times it’s just suspension components, timing belt and water pump and all the other consumable things. There are tiny annoyances here and there. During my ownership the heated seat switch decided to short out and my ass was cold on winter days, it took 5 minutes to replace with a new switch. The button to open the boot sometimes it gets stuck. The infotainment screen sucks, set your settings and replace it is my recommendation. Other than that I’ve had nothing major go wrong with mine. 

Busy city driving is great, you have a dna (dynamic, natural and all weather) switch which are your driving modes, in the comfort settings the steering wheel can be turned with one finger and the steering is very precise. Fuel economy wise you’ll average around 28mpg. On the motorway it is a car that I can sit in for hours, I absolutely loved how comfortable the bucket seats were. I’ve managed to take it to 145mph on a „track” and it was stable, no shake in the pedals or steering wheel nor I didn’t feel the suspension creaking or vibrating. Road noise I mostly left my windows open to listen to the exhaust which for a 4 cylinder was magnificent unlike every golf r or s3 on the road.

But they do it with interesting and subjectively affordable cars. And they come across as two genuine car nerds who just love talking about cars. No Turkey white teeth and horrible fucking thumbnails with over exaggerated facial expressions. I honestly find them very down to earth and palatable.

But in watching them, it's made me think where the fuck have I gone wrong in life, that I've never so much as done an oil change in my own car. Seen it done plenty of times and I ***understand*** how to do most serviceable items (oil, air/oil filters, brakes, spark plugs), but ever since I've owned cars, I've never trusted myself (or more realistically) had the time to do so.

In terms of your driveway, I think that ideally you would want a flat surface to work on, but I am certain that many tasks will still be suitable.

The most common case is they snap near one end, in which case you usually hear a loud crack, the corner of the car drops very slightly, and you may experience slightly degraded handling, increased tyre wear and clunking over bumps.


Worst case is they snap in the middle, in which case that corner of the car may drop a lot, to the point of being undrivable. If you're really unlucky, the broken end of the spring can end up dragging on your tyre and potentially puncturing it. "

1mw8vhl,Dad Car BMW,"
Right guys I need your help. My next car is going to be a BMW, that much I have decided. This going to be the second car as I already have a Karoq for family hauling. I'm a dad (30s) with two young kids (2y and 0y) so I need to have back seats that can occasionally deal with rear facing car seats. I have a commute that is 40 motorway miles round trip but I only do this once or twice a week on average, however this may start to creep up over the next year. I do this trip at very odd times of day, often at 3am or 4am and at that time I have very little interest in being uncomfortable. I want a car that will deal with light commuting duties and days out with the family when Dad can use his ""special"" car rather than the boring family car I already have. 

I've had my share of fast Fords, MX5s and a VW Golf R wagon. I like the idea of a big multi cylinder engine, especially a V8 or I6. I also like the idea of a convertible, however that comes from my soft spot for the aforementioned MX5. 

My budget is flexible but I want to spend around £15k and I've come up with three options.

Current front runner: M240i convertible, DCT. Seems to do it all, has the drama of roof down motoring, B58 engine is well regarded and will do the commute with no issues. Big engine + Small car = fun. However will those child seats fit in the back for the fun days out? 

Devil on my shoulder temptation: E90 M3, Manual. In Jerez black with Red interior is just car pornography for me, and is I car I have lusted after. However with my big boy pants on I have to put boring things like houses, holidays and other"" important"" things first before I spend £££ per year on maintenance and fuel of a 15+ year old sports car. Also I would feel bad if I had such a car and it was degraded by the commuting duties. 

Really quite a good deal right now: 640d convertible, I've seen them sub £10k and would meet a lot of my requirements however they have a whiff of old man about them. Would it also be a special enough drive?

2. MK1 GT86 (<80k miles)
3. F22 220i B48 (~85k miles)
4. MK3 TT TDI or TFSI (~85k miles)

I also drive approx 15 miles to work (is this too short for a diesel with the Audi?).

I used to drive a GT86, and then had a mk2 stage 2 TTS, so I really like my coupes.

I've always had inline 6 BMWs, literally every single car I've ever owned has been one, but now I'm just going to need something that is more comfortable and more efficient. I think the 5 series fits this category quite well, but I'm open to suggestions.

AlGunner (Score: 2): I tend to base my decision on fuel cost as much as anything. To get 15p per mile you need to average about 40mpg in a petrol and 43mpg in a diesel at rough current prices. Diesels are cheaper on longer trips but less efficient in slower traffic so the total mix of your journeys makes a difference. When I used to do a 30 mile each way commute I spent a lot of time in rush hour queues so it wasnt any cheaper with a diesel. As I can charge at home and only rarely need public chargers I have gone to an EV. At 2 1/2p  per mile fuel costs its racking up the savings. A change of circumstances after I got it means my mileage is a lot less now, but in the last year alone (which includes going through 2 MOT's) I reckon Ive saved well in excess of £1000 in overall ownership costs and probably closer to £2000. Ive had 2 new tyres in that time as well which should last a few years with my now lower mileage.

So just because you are doing more motorway miles doesnt mean a diesel is the best choice, theres a lot more to it than that. What is your mix of motorway and town? From the comment about manual I guess its more in town so straight away that makes me think maybe a petrol might be better, just a more efficient one than you have now. Manuals are normally more efficient than autos in ICE cars and I have never driven an auto I enjoyed. They just cant do performance when you want it and eco when you want it as well as a manual. E.g. if youre trying to get up to speed going uphill (lots of hills near me) autos always change up too early rather than stay in a lower gear and gain speed and then change unless you floor it which is often even less efficient.

I would recommend an EV if you can charge at home on an EV tariff and wouldnt need public chargers much. As they dont have gears, changing isnt an issue. Its just torque all the way which I enjoy when driving. More than makes up for the noise imo, in fact now Im used to it I just find ICE cars noisy.

In fact you can probably get a new MG4 with monthly payments not far off what you would save in fuel. They are the least reliable EV in a recent survey but less to go wrong than an old ICE car and under warranty. If I was still doing my 300 miles a week commuting Id be seriously considering one. ONly really losing the down payment but for a brand new car for a few years got to ask if its worth it.

My current car is now throwing up multiple expensive issues (burning oil at severe rate, using coolant, occasional starting issue, needs a full set of new tyres, air con condenser broken).

The raw sound of the 6-cylinder boxer, as it pushes you along the road. My 986 has 105,000 miles and counting, yet there is no better car for the B-roads of the UK. The small footprint makes it perfect for country lanes. The 2.7 engine puts out 217 horsepower and weighing only 1,250kg’s the handling is ideal for the twisting backroads of the countryside. The soft top lets you really experience the outdoors. Shockingly, the insurance is pretty reasonable too.  

Brand prestige can’t be overlooked here too. There is a fantasy associated with ‘owning a Porsche.’ Most people may immediately think 911, but the badge is the same. Having been fortunate to drive a 992 911 Carrera 4S, I would actually choose the Boxster. There is something exciting about being able drive closer to the limits of a car without actually breaking the law. Letting it rev out and staying within the limits. 

The Boxster is a surprisingly easy car to work on too. ‘101 Projects for Your Porsche Boxster’ is a staple for anyone who has one. Porsche have given the early Boxster classic status, meaning OEM parts are surprisingly affordable. There is also an incredible amount of aftermarket support for everything Porsche. Magnus Walker has made it acceptable to modify the classics too. Being a Porsche Outlaw is a brand, something to be proud of, something encouraged. The price of the 986 generation is now opening up this world to an entire new generation. 

We seem to be at a crossroads, then. The Boxster is still a little too expensive to count as the next MX-5. You can’t get one under £2,000 really, but can you get anything? The price of everything increasing, inflation hitting hard over the last few years. Do the dirt cheap project cars still exist? I don’t think so unfortunately. The worlds evolved and the price of entry is a bit more now. 

Does that mean that Porsche is the new Mazda? No, of course not. But, the Boxster could well be the new MX-5.",134,1755771824.0,93,CartalkUK,1755891187,2025-08-21 10:23:44,2025-08-22 19:33:07,"D3TPC (Score: 95): My boxster was £3800 I think. 03 plate 2.7 manual, 95k on clock now at 109k

Get a proper glow plug socket tool, don't rely on having a normal socket that fits, do it by hand, don't put too much force on it, once it starts to move, work it back and forth a few times even if it feels free, every few turns just work it back and forth a few times.

Be careful, it's not a hard job (As long as they are easy to get to), it can just go mental wrong if one snaps, if one does snap don't try the others until you've sorted that one, depending on how it snaps you can either drill it out, take the head off and tap it out from inside, or start the engine and send it to space (Done that before haha)

1mw6dm3,MOT advice - told car will definitely fail on the next MOT?,"Aiming to keep this brief, apologies;

I have a Peugeot 107 (09 plate) that is rather old. Had the MOT done Jan 2025; failed due to brake pipe and some welding required on door sill(?) but then retested passed. Guys at the garage who did the work on it said “I’d be looking for a new car sooner than later, as it won’t pass the next MOT, I’m surprised it passed this one”. Asked why, guy said the underneath of my car is really rotten, lots of rust. 

So in brief, any advice of my options? I’ll post some images of the underneath in the comments, but I’m a 3rd year uni student at present, and I start my job in November - my car is essential for my job, and though I’m looking at new cars, I would ideally like to get as much time as I can out of this one to give me chance to save up some money for a newer car.

Underseal won't prevent rust so there's no point doing that and I'm assuming as it's an old 107 it's worth a few hundred so paying someone to weld it is less productive than buying another car that isn't rusty for less money than the welding would cost. Plus once you weld them once unless they paint the inside of the welds too which budget weld jobs won't you'll only be delaying scrapping by a couple of years at best.

Another option is you could fit aftermarket plastic sills to cover the rust and if it covers it completely it'll pass an mot, even if the mot tester knows it's there they can't remove anything to find it so can't fail it but you've got a year I'd just buy another car before it runs out."

1mw3gf9,Citroen (DS) stop drive Airbag recall what to do?,"There is no end in sight for my mum on this recall.  She doesn’t have medical need and access to another car, so not as life and death as for some people for sure - still incredibly inconvenient..   what are others doing who aren’t able to just take the hit?

If it were me in the position of being told I'm not allowed to drive my car until the recall has been completed, id be on the phone to the dealer at least every day, probably several times, wanting to be given an immediate date for remedial works or a courtesy car. I'd be a right nuisance. 


It's not your mum's fault she's in this position. 

schlomping (Score: 2): Call the dealer its booked into for a courtesy car, if they dont have then call your insurer who should be able to get you one. Then call stellantis and ask for compensation and to make an account with them regarding that as for some godawful reason they've decided that you can only get compensation from them after you have an account.

My gf is going through the same and has done basically what I've told you here, other than she isn't allowed a courtesy because we're both 20 and not the minimum of 21 :/

But call your insurance, they should help. Then badger stellantis/Citroën for as long as you can be bothered. You'll be sat on hold for ages but itll gey you somewhere."
1mvw08s,What counts as a mod according to insurance?,"My car is old and looks like crap and I want to do what I can to make it look nicer. Currently my only ideas are black alloys (bought car with silver ones - assume thats factory standard) and pink wiper blades and arms (obviously pink is not factory standard) would these be mods I'd need to declare to insurance? 

Would anything that changes the appearance (not performance) would need to be declared? The policy documents don't specify they just say to declare modifications.

Also, if they need to be declared, will my insurance go up? Do I let them know before or after I've done it? And can I declare it via email (having to make a phone call is enough to put me off doing it full stop 😭)

Thanks! ",2,1755735408.0,8,CartalkUK,1755891187,2025-08-21 00:16:48,2025-08-22 19:33:07,"Sakers92 (Score: 9): ANYTHING non factory that you add. They class stickers and decals as modifications, if they want to deny a claim they will find something, so declare it ALL.


On the positive side if they're non performance mods it wont affect your cost much at all.


Best to declare it all up front because they might be cheeky and charge you an 'admin fee' to add it later.

Slideways027 (Score: 1): If it’s not OEM or a pattern part it’s a mod.

If you start there, and talk to your insurer before you change anything, you should be on safe ground and at least know if it’s going to cost more."
