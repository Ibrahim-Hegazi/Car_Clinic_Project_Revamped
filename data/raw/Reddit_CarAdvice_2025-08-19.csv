You can usually find the grams or lbs on the hood or engine bay. Since you have the proper equipment pull a vacuum on your tank, weigh the tank, then evacuate the system into the tank with the vacuum pump. Weigh the tank again and subtract your initial weigh and that’s refrigerant extracted. Now some vacuum pumps can be reversed to pump the refrigerant back in and you can add the difference from the can, just put the can on the scale and go until it’s reduced in weight by the amount you need. Then you have a perfectly charged system.

I've had a fuel leak and some fuel spilt in the area of the starter motor, but that was 48 hours ago and my logic is that it should have evaporated by now. I have also thoroughly cleaned the connections with no avail. I've taken the starter out and it seems dry, even after taking the solenoid out.

Occasionally, smoke will rise up from behind the steering wheel when this happens. It seems to originate from the ignition switch, but I'm not sure.

My mind immediately goes to either a short circuit or a bad starter solenoid. Looking at the wiring diagram in my Haynes manual (added above), I'm not sure where to start looking. Especially since the signal wire is colored black with a red stripe instead of any of the colors I see listed in said diagram.

1mtthl4,Is this normal for a mechanic?,"I'm relatively new to owning cars so maybe this is a dumb question I should already know the answer to...but I recently brought my car into a local mechanic shop, it was determined the cause of my problems are the alternator and the battery. 

The mechanic called me the day after it was brought in and told me what was wrong, and I told them something to the effect of ""ok great! Do you have an estimate on when the repairs will be done and how much they'll cost?"" To which the mechanic replied that he'd get settled as soon as I brought him the parts. 

I was really confused by this and asked what he meant.

He says I have to buy my own battery and alternator and bring them to his shop. 

I have no idea what to buy, he didn't tell me what to buy, and I am disabled and highly doubt I can carry a car battery. 

Is this normal? Do some mechanics do this? Because I feel like it's weird and I kind of want to just have the car towed to another shop. 

UPDATE: 
After two more conversations over the phone with this mechanic, one in which he got really irate with me when I told him I'm not comfortable buying the parts myself and they I probably wouldn't be able to carry them due to a disability I decided to call a tow truck to go get my car. 
They're picking it up this morning, I called the mechanic first thing when he opened and told him I was having my car moved to another shop that would be more accommodating to my needs and asked how much I owed him for the work he'd dobe already. He said 80$ which seemed a little ridiculous since all he did was look at the car and treat me poorly on the phone but whatever. 
He then proceeds to tell me he doesn't accept credit or debit card payments, and ""doesn't trust the mail"" enough for me to mail him a check and asked me to come in and pay cash. 
That seems sketchy as hell to me.
I'm absolutely not going to do that.

This is not at all unheard of for a shop to do, though it's not the norm. I imagine this is a small independent shop rather than a chain or dealership. I would bet if you simply tell him you're not able to acquire the parts yourself but are happy to provide him with the funds to purchase them, likely with a markup to accommodate his time and effort as is typical in shops, maybe he's happy to do that and is just accustomed to other customers usually wanting to provide their own parts to save money."

If there's a dash light that should be there and isn't when it flashes all the lights that can be a sign of fraud, i.e. it's easier to pull the bulb out rather than fix why the check engine light is on, sketchy used dealer things usually. I'm willing to bet you just hadn't noticed it before. 

If it turns off and stays off during your drive your tire pressure is good, if it stays on you have a low or overfilled tire, if it flashes repeatedly you have a Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) fault, likely a dying sensor. Fill to the spec that it says on the sticker somewhere in your driver door frame if not potentially on the end of the same door, or in your owners manual. What it says on the tire is the maximum psi it can be filled to safely.

Inspect your tire for punctures, bulges, or deep gashes especially ones where you can see the cords in the tire. All of the above require the attention of a tire shop, most chain shops will not patch a tire if it has a puncture in the sidewall or within 1"" of the edge of the tread, so be prepared for the "" we would like to sell you a tire"" talk.

If you want to make your tech happy identify the leak and the tire it's on with soapy water (dawn works well) from a spray bottle, check things you think are leaks, little bubbles mean a slow leak lotta bubbles mean big leak. Check the part where the tire meets the wheel (called the bead), corrosion can build up in the bead and a new scratch from bumping a curb could have upset the corrosion spot and broken the seal.

That was end of summer /fall 2024 but xmas came and still had not heard.
When i called them in jan 2025 they said their staff quit and they had to do a new appt.

They duplicated the leak.

at last, the unholy trinity is upon us (for car)

so my sister's husband  just bought his first car (toyota sienna 2014) as a hand me down car within the family. 

quick back story: he just come to US, didnt know language and anything so whatever it is, he just learn on the way. 

back to the problem: He got it from a mechanic uncles that apparently real good at fixing cars (he works on cops car). 

so this car originally belonged to the father of the uncle who passed away, which to be sold to my brother in law from the uncle for ~4k. 

the claims were supposed to be all ""pristine"" condition since only the father that drove that car for grocery and stuff. 

received the car with broken headlights front and back (sorry, no pics) and scratches all around the car. front lips is hanging by a thread. & the condition as pictured within barely a month of purchase and actual possession. 

my sister & her husband did went to costco to check the tire pressures and sensors and have it changed. still got the tire pressure notification for some reason. 

he barely drives around since it keep having the tires sensor light on and now (again, as pictured) this happen. 

i understand that even if it is within the family purchase he should've asked for car fact reports and damages despite the price. and yes, i know, we been fooled, but in my defense i did told him to purchased a certified used car instead bc warranty for these kind of problems. 

told me on the day of getting the car thats what they could afford (actually they dont, they could afford more but was pressured in buying it off from within the family as ""first friendly use"") 

now, you can troll and said whatever it is, i dont really care. For the car people, is there anything i can do to help? lots of thanks! 🙏🏻 

ps: i actually have the same problem with a hand me down acura mdx (couldnt recall the year, got it in 2017, it was a used car and a hand me down). drove for a year and ended up have to junk yard it bc its expensive to fix.

Besides a jump, which really does me no good if I haven’t addressed the fuel issue, what are my options? All suggestions welcomed, although I’m not mechanically inclined.

Any thoughts on this? If I have to end up replacing the alternator I think it is probably worth learning something and doing it myself (the youtube tutorials appear very informative). Would probably have to spend 30-50 on some tools for the bolts and 200-300 for the part rather than 1k at the shop. Seems I can't find an OEM part for less than like 800 online?

1mu1w2j,Help me solve my squeaky brakes,"So I recently replaced the front brakes on my ‘16 Outback. I didn’t skimp on parts. Rock auto, Raybestos R-line ceramic pads and matching rotors. 

I installed them and they squeak on the passenger side. I gave them time to bed and wasn’t able to take a closer look for 1000 miles. I took them apart, re-cleaned, re-lubricated, reassembled. Still there. 

I was convinced it was a faulty pad and Rock Auto graciously replaced them. I did the job over again. Same result. About 1000 miles into them so bedding is not the issue. 

I talked to my mechanic who was unavailable to look for himself but said most likely it was the rotor scraping the backing plate. I was able to get in there with a long flathead and push the plate back a bit. No change. 

So let me specifically describe the problem:
The noise is from the passenger front. It’s only there while driving forward. Not in reverse. It’s not only when the brake is applied. It is not consistent and matches the wheel rpm as if it’s a high spot in the rotor. Seemingly, when the brakes are cold the noise gets better when brakes are applied, when they are warmed from driving, it gets worse. The noise is more pronounced when turning to the left and weight is shifted to the right. The noise is only when the car is on the ground. It’s gone when you lift the wheel and free spin it. 

I’m at a loss here. 
I appreciate your input in advance. ",0,1755559073.0,5,autorepair,1755632102,2025-08-18 23:17:53,2025-08-19 19:35:02,"Moses66737 (Score: 2): Get your wheel bearing checked out. Sounds like it is failing. Replace both fronts if you can afford to.

NOT A MAN OF HIS WORD  
So I came to you(Omar) because my power steering pump had failed, and a good friend referred you. It was you(Omar) that recommended these parts to go into my vehicle and that you(Omar) had purchased and installed. I trusted you(Omar) as the mechanic to take care of this. It's almost been a year. Then I decided to pay more to have this problem finally done, this was your suggestion. The problem still has not been rectified. Then you blame me as to my driving habits to why the part has failed(maybe it was bad workmanship, don't know). Then you say that you did not charge me for labour for the three or four times that it was definitely under warranty and you told me that several times. Also you mentioned ""Going sue me"", after asking for my money back. You are sounding that you are not a man of your word. The path that you choose will be the karma downfall of your business and marriage and other relationships . I have done nothing wrong and have not abused my vehicle.  
GO AHEAD AND TELL ME I AM WRONG.

Here is his response :

""Stingey little weasel, with short little Chinese arms that can't drive a vehicle ""

Omar, you are the one that came up with the pricing, not me.  
I just wanted my vehicle repaired properly. Notice he does not own up to his doing.

Would you want to deal with a person like this?

I get it, the parts you purchased and you installed and all failed was the customer's fault. And you want to charge extra labour for that, WOW I hope a lot of people are reading this.  
Ends up the leak was from the rack and pinion he replaced, not the 4 power steering pumps, WHAT AN IDIOT!

Usually its because the starter isnt meshing cleanly with the flywheel. That could be caused by several things but the most common are:
1. worn/slow bendix drive or sticky solenoid

2. the gear teeth on your flywheel are rounded off in spots, causing it to not join correctly 

3. Low voltage/poor grounds. Double check battery, terminals, and grounds. 12v at rest, >10v while cranking

4. Starter misalignment/loose bolts or wrong starter. Probably not the wrong starter, especially if its still stock oe. You could definitely double check alignment and for loose bolts tho.

Really, it sounds like your starter and flywheel are not being bestfriends lol and sorting it out now is way better than later cause starting it like that is only gonna chew up the gear teeth on the flywheel too and thats a transmission-off kinda repair. Deal with the starter now, save yourself trans work in the future, so long as its not too bad now. If you have rounded teeth on the flywheel, you might as well replace that when you replace the starter. 

You can remove the starter yourself and check the bendix drive for dmg on the teeth or a bent shaft. Then you can peek at the gear through the starter hole and turn the motor with a 19mm at the crank. You'd be looking for chewed up dmg to the gears teeth. Doesn't have to be all of them, just a small spot is enough to cause it. 

TL;DR
Something definitely sounds wrong, like your starter and flywheel aren't meshing the way they should. Checking it out and dealing with it now will more than likely save you money, a headache, and trans work in the future.

I pulled in for an oil change at a Meineke or some such place, and after half an hour or so the man pulled me out of the lobby and into the garage, and said firmly that they wouldn't be ""servicing \[my\] vehicle""  because it had zero oil in it. 

I checked it myself when he said that and indeed, by the dipstick anyway, there was zero oil.

My memory is fuzzy on the next point but I believe they wouldn't even sell me oil to put in on my own, they simply refused to do anything at all related to that vehicle. In any case (maybe they let me put in a quart?) I know I drove off the lot with the notion that I was driving on no, or practically no oil.

I pulled into like a jiffy lube just on the off chance they would be willing to ""service my vehicle,"" and they did. Not only did they do an oil change, they made no remarks whatsoever about anything being out of the ordinary. I didn't see for myself that they actually pulled substantial amounts of oil out of the car but by their very normal, nonchalant demeanor it appeared to me that as far as these people were concerned, my car had oil in it and there was no issue.

I never experienced a single problem that could have been related to running for some unknown number of days or weeks with no oil in the system.

1mtl8og,2006 Nissan Xterra 4WD 4L V6 Issues,"   Hi there, first time posting here or anywhere really and I just need some advice or suggestions about my car that’s been sitting for a while now. Unfortunately I’ve been in a bit of a rut for a while now and my car was one of the things adding to my economic stress for a while with insurance and fixing it up, so I basically just had it sitting for about 2 years not wanting to sell it because it would’ve been hard to let go of and basically admitting defeat after all the work and money I put into it in my younger days.

    Now that I’ve given some context, I want to explain what I think is wrong with it from the symptoms and would love to ask for any suggestions from people who may’ve worked on these models before.

    Dirty fuel line is my primary fear as I mostly drained the car before it sat but there was a bit of fuel in there for a while. It didn’t smell like varnish or anything but I really don’t know, especially because went I got it running last month it was shaking a bit and acceleration felt very off. 

     Is there anything else I should look out for if this sounds like the problem?

     I’m also worried about the engine health from me running the engine a bit just to move it a block or two on street cleaning days.

     I bought some Techron to hopefully flush the fuel line, but I wanted to consult y’all before I fill the tank with a ton of fuel and end up just needing to drain it anyways to replace parts of the fuel system. I replaced the fuel pump over a decade ago with my dad’s help as a teen and I really don’t want to have to do that again with how expensive and labor intensive it was.

     I can do most things on this car myself, and as long as it doesn’t need specialized tools I probably will. I understand some mechanics may scoff at that and assume “well there’s your problem you’re just messing things up along the way” but I want to reiterate the core of my car problems aren’t my ability to manage it but my own personal issues and anxiety management interfering with my motivation to solve this problem.
      For reference on this car I’ve replaced/fixed:
- Fuel pump
- Water pump
- Radiator
- Timing belt
- Oil filter/ Oil change
- Tires (Didn’t bead them myself)
- Misc. sensors

     All of these fixes have been done over the course of the last decade and I had some help for the fuel pump and radiator, but thats more so from when my step-dad still lived around and was able to keep an eye on the process.

      I honestly just want to get this thing in driving condition again ASAP so I can have a method of transportation again, and I’m really not in a great spot to just give up and sell it for peanuts.

      If there’s any clarification needed please ask and I’d love to provide it, thanks for reading guys and I’m just looking for some advice if anyone has any ideas.

What you show in the picture actually looks like the windshield is delaminating. As you are probably aware, the windshield is made up of two layers of glass with a layer of (something) in between which makes it so it won't shatter when impacted. And by shatter, I mean it will crack and all, but won't become a billion pieces of glass all over the occupants. Anyway, this is exactly what it looks like when these layers start to separate. The only fix for it is to get the windshield replaced. Even if there is rust behind where the delamination is taking place, you'll still need to get the windshield replaced at some point to fix the issue.

You cannot fix this with sealer. The windshield will continue to delaminate."

1mty99l,2010 Toyota Matrix: worth it to replace AC condensor?,"As title, I have a 2010 Toyota Matrix, with about 300k km.  The AC has kind of stopped blowing cold air lately, so I took it in to have the professionals look at it.  

I'm told the condensor needs replacing, which will be about $1000 CAD all-in.  They said a lot of people tend to prefer to wait until the beginning of next summer, which I'm inclined to do.

Financially, the cost seems worthwhile.  On weekdays, I commute about an hour round-trip, plus whatever on weekends.  If I call it 25 hours per month times 4 months of summer, that's 100 hours of needing the AC per year.  I plan to keep this car at least another 5 years, so I'm buying 500 hours of cold AC comfort in the summer.

$2/hour of comfort is not bad.  But only if this will actually solve the problem long-term.  

They mentioned that after a replacement that old hoses (or whatever other parts of the system) sometimes can't take the newly increased pressure, and they can start breaking down more?

Basically, I'm willing to spend the $1000 if that's all it will cost.

I first went for an inspection and oil change. I've never had an issue since I've had this car but they said I needed new struts, new tires, an alightment, a new cabin air filter, etc. It was about $1600 total. I declined the cabin filter because it was $150 and my husband said he could do it at home for $10. He bought the filter and the next day put it in. The day after, I noticed my air conditioning wasn't working anymore. It blew air but it didn't get cold. My husband took out the air filter, put the old one back in, messed around with it, etc but nothing helped. So I brought it back in. They said I had a condenser leak so they had it for three days and it was going to be $800 to fix. I was hesitant but said to go ahead because it's been so freaking hot. Today they call me and said they got the condenser in but now the compressor isn't working. Another $1200. This feels crazy. 

At the same time, my husband brought his car, a 2013 Ford focus, in to the same place because it was rattling over 50mph. They put on some new tires and did an alignment but now his check light engine is on. This started a couple of days after he got it back from the mechanic. 

Can a mechanic sabotage it's customers to have to keep coming back, or are we just having horrible luck with both of our older cars all at once?

IF you're constantly having to top the tires up, something is causing the leaks. Inspect tread for anything puncturing them and have the above mentioned service checked for / performed

Once all possible leaks are narrowed down / remedied, look into Nitrogen filling your tires, may run you $60-$80 to fill the tires, but as long as they dont leak they also shouldn't fluctuate with temperature

1mttwf8,Looking for low-cost but reliable impact wrench for working on my car.,"So recently I worked on my car in order to fix a misfire.  I'm not too savvy, but I'm learning, and YouTube guides made it successful.  The car is a 2017 Dodge Charger, and the misfire was on C6, and for those that don't know, C4, C5, and C6 on Chargers are beneath the upper intake manifold.

So I was able to remove it, replace the coil pack, spark plug, and upper manifold gaskets, and torqued everything back to proper spec, and all seemed fine for two months.  Last week, the misfire repeated, but self-corrected.  I'm no idiot, I know there is something else going on, which I believed I've narrowed to either the fuel injector, itself, or the wiring harness that goes to the injector.  It's at the shop for testing, now, to confirm. 

Because I don't want to spend the money on them fixing it, knowing I can now, likely, do it myself, I want to make it faster.  Last time it took a couple of days, in part because of unfamiliarity, and in part because I was using manual tools. This time, I'd like to speed it up, and based on my reading, it seems a mid-torque impact wrench will be my best bet.   

So my question is twofold: is my analysis of the problem and tool necessary correct? 

And, second, what is a good, reliable, but budget-level impact wrench that can handle 8mm to 18mm sockets, do I need to worry about actually buying impact sockets for this job, and if so, are there good sets that cover my bases, here?  I already have the sockets for the manual ratchet - can I just use those, despite the material differences, even though I know I'll need impact sockets for tougher bolts, down the line? 

I am not looking to spend a lot of money, here - not much to spend.  But any and all advice and explanations will be welcomed.

This prevents the block from cracking in the winter when the water freezes and allows the mixture to stay a liquid rather than boiling on hot engine parts when under high load. Second is anti corrosion. Water on its own can lead to electrolysis corrosion and impurities can break down plastic a little bit enough to weaken them. All coolants have specific additives to prevent this as much as possible. Nothing is perfect but it can be a lot better than plain water.

Old fluid with suspended contaminants does not lubricate or cool components effectively.

1mthzca,My DPF is driving me insane,"Caption: DPF soot spiking early into EVERY drive and starting regen, even after a 'completed' regen on the previous drive  
  
Hi I would love some input on what is going on with my DPF, it does just seem to always be regenerating and wasting fuel so if anyone can immediately spot what's wrong from my description that would be amazing.

**Whats happening:**

DPF regen starts\~15 minutes into EVERY drive. (DPF App shows a sudden spike in soot) it then 'completes' (soot mass calc. drops to 1g) after \~60mins but keeps toggling on and off active regen every minute. Near the end of my long drives it seems to toggle on whenever start braking and turn off again when at speed. This seems to go on indefinitely. Into longer 4+ hour drives the DPF light does show, but immediately clears on restart and has not triggered limp mode yet.

**Car Details:**

* Skoda Superb 2.0 TDI DSG
* 140K Miles 
* Bought a year ago so no real history on DPF likely original 
* Burns some oil (\~0.5L per 1000 miles, VW states up to 0.8L is normal)
* Shortest drive I do is 1 hour with me driving 1000 miles in 14 hours back from France a couple months ago (dpf light coming on every 4 hours whilst at speed but clearing on restarts)

**Things I have tried:**

1. The original pressure sensors did need replacing as they gave an engine warning light, but I replaced with 3rd party 
2. I have tried to clear the sensor pipes with compressed air (with the engine on)
3. Assisting the regen by driving at 2.5K RPM at 70mph (changing from drive to manual)

**My best guesses:**

1. Temperature/pressure sensor faults 
2. Ash content / DPF age causing issues 
3. EGR issues

If anyone can say from this info that would be amazing, I'm not sure I want to buy a new DPF if its just a sensor issue. But at the moment regenerating every drive feels like a waste.

However, when they were doing an oil change, I noticed a blueish-green liquid leaking near the passenger-side lower area. I asked them about it they said it’s a leak but wasn’t when they were vacuuming. I trust that shop even less now, I am from Toronto,Canada let me know if you can help out.

My car’s coolant is pink, so I don’t think it’s coolant.

Also, I’ve noticed some colorless liquid on my driveway.

Could this be leftover AC dye, or is it something I should be worried about? Any tips on how to identify the source would be appreciated!",1,1755498549.0,2,AskMechanics,1755632102,2025-08-18 06:29:09,2025-08-19 19:35:02,"NickRMX6 (Score: 1): DIYer advice:

The car made this clicking sound that sounds like it's coming from somewhere under the car below the front seats. It continued for about 1 minute after I turned the car off and then stopped. It is not coming from under the hood. It does not sound this loud in person.   

This happened after driving for 15 miles. Upon parking, both the radiator and overflow tank were full. The overflow tank was literally filled to the cap at the top even hours later at ambient tempurature. The car did not overheat, there was leaking radiator fluid all down below, but not on the ground. There were two spots where it sprayed under the hood but no fluid was on the hood. No white smoke, power loss, coolant in oil, knocking, or misfires.  

https://imgur.com/a/XEWkqkR

I'm hoping they just overfilled the overflow tank somehow. It could be a water pump, transmission, or some other issue but I haven't noticed any power loss. 

I got the Freon recharged yesterday and drove about 10 miles each way with no issues. The AC is nice and cold.   

I got my car back on Tuesday after getting all of my radiator hoses and thermostat replaced. I have driven the last 5 days with no issues until today, although I haven't gone more than 10 miles each way and have taken multiple trips per day.  
They said there was some air escaping the radiator when I got the thermostat and hoses replaced. I'm guessing it's possible it was caused by a blown head gasket, the shop not bleeding the cooling system when refilling the radiator, or the thermostat. I did pass a smog check 2 weeks prior, the oil changed 2 months prior, and replaced the radiator which was cracked 8 months prior. It's had maybe 3000 miles put on it this year. 

Before taking it to the shop, my car previously made this clicking sound for over 5 minutes and much faster in the same spot when I parked after driving 8 miles. There was no coolant leak under the hood at this point.  On the return trip the engine tempurature started to rise after hitting a speedbump and I pulled over immediately. There was coolant sprayed everywhere under the hood and trailing the car. They said it was a gallon short of fluid.

Tacoma's before the latest generation are solid, the ones with the 3.5. outside of the normal maintenance/tires/brakes there's few issues. Hard to go wrong there.

Rams are pretty good overall, just get the V8. Maintenance is more expensive due to spark plugs needing 16 (2 per cylinder) and special trans fluid, but the aftermarket is catching up and it's not so expensive anymore. 

Fords aren't terrible, I prefer the V8 over the Ecoboost, after seeing several that have turbo issues. 

Tundras are good as well, before the latest update. Have heard lots of turbo issues there too. 

I'm not a fan of the compact or midsize trucks, even the Tacoma's. While they are or can be good trucks, they seem to be pushing full size overall size with less capabilities and the same MPGs. That's not a knock on the trucks, just many seem out of place for their costs and capabilities overall. 

I'm sure this doesn't help your decision much, just things I've seen as a truck enthusiast and working in automotive for 20 years."

The noise changes when you steer; when you do that you are changing the load on the front wheel bearings by making the body lean- centrifugal force going around a turn makes the weight of the car shift to the outside of the turn.      The noise gets quieter on left turns, where the weight of the car leans to the right; and it gets louder on right turns where you are putting more weight on the left wheel bearing.    Therefore the left one is likely the source of the noise.

Incidentally, you may want to replace the wheel bearings on both sides while doing this repair.   They are the same age and have been driven the same number of miles, so both are worn.

1mtubgn,How can I get my brake caliper piston back in?,"Hey everyone, I need some advice.

While working on my brakes, I accidentally pressed the brake pedal too far and the piston popped out of the caliper. The first time it happened I was able to push it back in, but the second time it came out further and now it won’t go back in.

I tried using a piston rewind tool, but it looks like the piston hit the edge and won’t sit straight anymore.

Is there any way to carefully get the piston back in again?

1mtjoon,Mechanic Pay options - advice needed,"HI all, I own a two-bay garage and have been without a mechanic for almost a year now. I have a full-time job and bought this garage to try to keep it going for the community (only garage in the area). I have been fixing cars on weekends and evenings myself (I am a mechanic, but only ever wanted to be able to work on my own vehicles, and my day job is pretty good, not automotive related).  Anyway - I finally found someone willing to move here (Nova Scotia) and they're a fully trained mechanic with a few years experience. I would like to know what options people may have experience with beyond just a regular hourly rate. e.g., last mechanic was paid $25 per hour for 40 hours per week. Shop rate was $80. I am thinking to increase shop rate to $90 and I'm willing to pay $30/hour to the mechanic - but I was also thinking I'd be willing to go higher but based on hours billed. For example, I'd pay $40 per hour but only for every hour billed out. My fear though is that jobs start taking longer or customers get billed for unnecessary stuff. Just wondering any thoughts? I mean it when I say I just want the business to be sustainable and if it turns a small profit, that'd be great. Right now I am barely keeping bankruptcy away so anything will be better.

For me stuff like height adjustable seat and steering wheel with adjustable height, reach and rake can make a bigger difference ([www.parkers.co.uk](http://www.parkers.co.uk) had detailed specs for specific models.) VAG cars are often good, but insurance can often be pricier (VW and Audi especially).

I went for a Skoda Citigo. But had to get the top spec to get height adjustable seats. More comfortable than my Civic two size classes above it. Was half the price to insure than a Polo 1.2 despite actually being quicker. People did enjoy seeing my 6/4 and then near 300lb frame climb out of it!

But the automatic transmission is woeful (same as the near identical Mii and Up!) so don't go for that.

A reasonable shout could be looking for something that's the least cool for a young person to be seen in. Maybe a Rover 75 or Mondeo or Volvo estate. But insurance is so personal YMMV.

But everything has a downside. These may be more difficult for a new driver and tax, insurance and fuel costs may be higher.

Oh and you might actually find it cheaper to take more lessons and get your manual licence as insurance can be much cheaper and cars in your budget are much more abundant.

1mtu7lf,I have an obligation to have a realistic photo on my driving licence for renewal don't I?,In short - that time has come around again and I'm having to renew my driving licence. In all honesty the last 10 years hasn't been kind to me in terms of aging and frankly my photo on my licence only loosely resembles me (as I have a lot less hair and am usually carrying around a couple of weeks of beard). I was intending on getting a new photo done; but reading up on the form (and someone else at work said why?) apparently you don't have to submit a new photo and it can all be done online and stuff now?

I found a 2012 (62) Skoda Fabia 1.4 TSI vRS S2000 DSG for £4,295 and I'm going to look at it and test drive it on Friday.

I'm hoping my cousin (mechanic) will be able to come with me but on the off chance he can't and I have to go by myself, I just wanted to come here and ask to see if there's anything I should be looking out for with the Fabia or when buying a car in general. I'm a bit clueless and don't have many people in my life I can easily access who know a great deal about cars.

Here's what I've got so far:

* 4 previous owners
* 91k miles and full service history (dates and milages) with most recent servicing at 90,766 miles
* MOT valid until next July with no advisories (hasn't failed an MOT or had any advisories since 2022)
* Timing chain and water pump changes invoiced
* Gearbox serviced twice with most recent one at 60k miles

However, I got a really good price on a front-wheel alignment and two new tyres through a work-benefit discount scheme that my normal local garage could not match.

This was at the Halfords Auto Centre in Sittingbourne, Kent.

This was booked for Saturday the 9th. My confirmation email had the alignment and two new tyres on it. I arrive on the 9th for my booking. I get there to be told that the tyres aren't on the booking despite the full order invoice amount paid reflecting something way more expensive than just an alignment and more akin to two new tyres on top. 

I was redirected to Halfords support by the garage who apologized and then despite being asked to reschedule me for ASAP (I already knew this would have had to be Monday as they weren't open Sunday) I was told the earliest they could do it was Wednesday. I opened a complaint and took the rescheduling to Wednesday as a refund couldn't be issued as cash due to the work discount scheme and besides I had assumed a refund would take longer now my job was being affected.

I couldn't use my car in the mean-time due to the tyre being illegal on it due to uneven wear as a result of the misalignment.

I turn up Wednesday at 8:30 ready for my car to be aligned and tyre swapped, just to be told only 1 tyre has arrived on the order as they only put 1 on. I was then told by the shop manager he will attempt to source another ASAP and might be able to get one for Lunch. I was supposed to go back into work for Lunch so it was slightly annoying but not the end of the world, I added this to my complaint with Halfords.

  
I then received an email from the shop manager saying it won't be there until Thursday now. This was yet another delay which I added to my complaint and my car would be seen PM on Thursday as they were ""incredibly busy"". I finally got my car done which I collected at 4:45PM on Thursday and returned to work Friday.

  
I have email correspondence from Halfords admitting this was ""most likely a glitch"" word-for-word. This was then added to my complaint. I just heard back Today from the complaints department who could only offer me £25 gift card. After 10 minutes of back-and-forth this was upped to £50 cash with no further budging. I have refused this with the intention of going to the motor ombudsman, however, the specific Halfords garage I went to is not listed on the motor ombudsman website.

If you (understandably) can't be talked out of it. The MG B is wonderful car to drive, and as classics go one of the easiest to maintain. The B-Series is reliable, simple and okay on fuel given it's age, though be prepared for it to drop a bit of oil. Pretty much all classics do, just part of the experience.

With that kind of mileage per-year you will likley be fine, but it is worth finding a classic car specialist in your area to help take care of it. It's also worth speaking to the owners club and trawling through the realms of YouTube to learn a bit about old maintainance. It is guaranteed that you will have to do some.

All that said the thing that concerns me more with older cars is rust. The mechanical parts of an MG B are cheap and easy to fix, of the body or rusty it can cost you an absolute fortune. There are guides online that show all the common rust spots (check all of them when you go to see the car) and if you buy it I recommend taking it to a rust treatment place and getting the underside coated. It makes a world of difference!

Final point, I'd recommend a B GT over a B Roadster of you're going to use it as your only car. Theyre much easier to live with all year round, and way more practical for basic stuff like shopping. You can even fit four people in one if you're willing to remove some limbs off your friends. What a time to be alive!"

1mtn0yp,"Anyone else had issues with upselling at National Tyres / Halfords? (Altrincham, Manchester)","Hi all,

I recently had some work done at the **National Tyres / Halfords Autocentre in Altrincham (Manchester),** and I’m wondering if others have faced similar problems with upselling unnecessary services.

Here’s what happened to me:

* I went in for a **major service + 1 new tyre**. Alongside that, I was billed for:
   * Extended tyre warranty – £10.44
   * 4-wheel alignment – £90.24
   * Wheel balance – £30.36
   * Swapping front tyres with rear – £19.00
   * Oil system flush – £19.00
* A couple of weeks later, I had to go back because a **radiator leak** wasn’t spotted during the major service. They replaced the radiator and then also billed me for:
   * Coolant change ×2 – £37.99
   * Another 4-wheel alignment – £90.24

They told me the extra alignment was needed because they had to “remove the front end of the car” and supposedly the suspension was affected, but from what I can tell (Hyundai i40) radiator replacement doesn’t normally require suspension removal or realignment.

I tried escalating the complaint via the Halfords website because I didn’t want to just hear the same response from the store, but they basically routed it back to the same team who insisted everything was correct.

👉 My question: **Is this standard practice at Halfords/National Tyres, or does it sound like unnecessary upselling?** Has anyone else dealt with this kind of situation, especially at the Altrincham branch?

Looking for a bit of advice because this situation seems completely wrong to me.

Here’s the problem:

  
After I’d cancelled, that accident management company still spoke to the third-party insurer and told them to write the car off. Even worse, they did it without ever agreeing a value with me, and the vehicle was immediately given a Cat S marker and added to MIAFTR.

My own insurer has since looked at the car, confirmed it isn’t a write-off, and it’s now fully repaired — but the Cat S marker is still there and the third-party insurer refuses to remove it.

Is an insurer actually allowed to do that?  
Can they just write a vehicle off based on their own valuation, even if the owner hasn’t accepted anything?

Are you missing some points? If it's been written off but also been repaired and inspected then I presume you've bought it back and repaired it with the proceeds of the claim? If not, who repaired it, and how did your insurer manage to inspect it? Since they'd have nothing to do with the loss (as you went via the other parties insurance).

ETA:

Or maybe it was given the marker very sharpish, you retracted the claim via CM/TP insurance, went via your own insurance who then made the repairs (who will then recover the costs from TP insurance) and noted they wouldn't have written it off? That I can see is maybe what happened?"

The mileage is low for the age, and they’ve offered to let me pay in installments, which is helpful. However, I'm hesitant due to the MOT history, and I plan to only go ahead if it passes the upcoming MOT in September.

Here are the concerns:

The last MOT (Aug 2024) initially failed for:
Dangerously worn rear brake pads
- Rear brake disc in poor condition
- Parking brake efficiency failure
- Rear brake imbalance

These issues were apparently repaired the next day and it passed.

It also has repeat advisories for corroded front brake pipes, showing up for at least 3 years without being addressed.

Previous MOTs flagged:
- Worn suspension arm bushes
- Brake pad/disc wear
- At least 6 MOT failures across its history

I know the Jazz has a good rep for reliability, and I trust the seller personally. They also sent me pictures of the car and it looks pretty good, clean exterior and interior. But the MOT history still makes me nervous about ongoing maintenance costs and whether the car has been properly maintained over time or just patched up to pass MOTs.

Would you say £2,500 is a fair price? Or should I negotiate lower, or walk away?

I'd appreciate any insights, especially from people familiar with older Jazz models or similar MOT patterns. I will also add screenshots of the past MOTS.

So we had a discussion about the car sitting on the lot for a while before we bought it etc etc, and I took the car away again after listening to him waffle.

Murphy's law kicked in and the fault appeared again a couple of days later when I had the car back, and then disappeared again once the stop/start kicked in. My question is where do I go from here? Everything points towards a faulty sensor which is triggering the warning lights (ABS related if I recall correctly), but the dealer is unwilling to replace random sensors in the hope of replacing the right one - which I sympathise with to a certain extent - you can't fix a fault that doesn't present itself.

Other than this the car is fine. As a buyer, I want the fault to be the responsibility of the seller, but it feels like at some point its going to be my problem, as I'm sure there will come a point where its not reasonable to go back to him in a few months?

So I feel caught between a rock and a hard place here. At the extreme, could I reject the car on the basis of the above? I'd rather not, but if that's the only way to resolve the situation, then I will.

1mtiorz,Can anyone talk me through the VW/SEAT SUV range…,"Hey guys. 
Slightly hate myself for this as I swore I’d never touch an SUV. 

We a VW T-Cross as a hire car on holiday and we’ve actually loved it - particularly the higher seating positions- but the boot is a bit small for our needs on a day to day basis. 

From what I can see there are various VW (and Seat) SUVs and I’m confused about where they each sit. I’d be looking second hand so it appears there’s the T-Cross, T-Roc, (T-Rex? t-Bag?), Taigo, Tiguan, Touareg and possibly more, whilst SEAT have the Arona, Ateca and one other possibly? There are also the Skodas but 

Can anyone help me understand rstand where each sits in the range in terms of size or normal car equivalent? And are there any models or engines we should really avoid second hand?

Taigo is similar in size, maybe *slightly* bigger, but a coupe-crossover shape which dents practicality. Still very much Polo sized.

Then you've got T-Roc, which is roughly Golf-sized but also a bit coupe-ish.

Tiguan and Tayron (which is the replacement for the Tiguan Allspace) are both more SUV than crossover, and occupy the 'big family car' space. Allspace/Tayron can be had as 7-seaters. Think: bigger than a Golf, not as big as a Passat. ID4 and ID5 are VW's electric equivalents for this segment.

Then there's the Touareg, which isn't long for this world, which sits above the Tayron/Tiguan and is more aimed at the executive/premium end of things. Pretty massive and based on the same undercrackers as the Audi Q7 and Porsche Cayenne.

SEAT's equivalents are Arona (Polo-size, much the same as T-Cross), Ateca (similar to an old-shape Tiguan) and Tarraco (a seven-seater similar to the old Tiguan Allspace). No EVs from SEAT but Cupra will flog you a Tavascan, which is an electric SUV coupe similar to the ID5 but with more creases. Cupra also does more performance-orientated versions of Ateca, as well as the Formentor (roughly T-Roc sized), and Terramar (basically Tiguan sized).

Skoda will do you a Kamiq (= T-Cross), Karoq (= Tiguan) and Kodiaq (= Tiguan Allspace or Tayron). Elroq and Enyaq in electric flavours.

Recommendation: if you need bigger than a T-Cross, I'd look at T-Roc or Tiguan (VW), Karoq (Skoda) or Ateca (SEAT/Cupra), or a Cupra Formentor.

1mtinfx,What's even under the seats? Any modern 7 seater with removable/disappearing middle seat?,"I'm coming from a 2014 Ford Grand CMax, which like most of its MPV stablemates was discontinued some time ago. We're currently looking for a near new 7 seater and one thing I've realised is that the disappearing middle seat in my Cmax was GOLD and that function now appears to be DUST, ie I can't find anything like it?!

So while the car has seats 6 and 7 in a third row in the boot, those are actually seats 5 and 6 in order of preference/usability. The middle seat in the second row is actually ""the 7th seat"" because its the smallest and least used seat in the whole car. And because of this Ford made it disappearing.

The outer seat bottom cushion next to it behind the driver flips up, ie the actual seat your bottom sits on. This reveals the space beneath the seat. The middle seat backrest folds down as per normal but then the whole seat also flips over sideways and stows under the outer seat next to it. Pop that cushion back down and you've suddenly got a 6 seater with a really good walk-through between the middle row seats for kids.

For 3 and 4 kid families that configuration is GREAT. Nice walk through, easy getting in and out of all seats even with car seats in place, no flipping seats forward and squeezing into the back row. If you then need more of the boot space and you have to flatten some/all of row three you can flip the middle seat back into place and you can squeeze the kids into the middle row as normal for the yearly family roadtrip or whatever with the boot full of luggage.

Does anyone know of ANY new or near new 7 seaters that do anything like that? Removable or disappearing second row middle seat allowing easy 6 seat configuration with walk through while still retaining the ability to convert back into 7 seater within moments/minutes to allow full use of boot in 5 seater mode?

Nearest thing I can find is 40-20-40 split configs but that's just the back rest and would be 'clamber-through' at best rather than walk-through. 60-40 splits are just useless, can't understand the laziness of that design.

I'm currently considering these two vehicles as a commuter car. I'm drawn to the safety of the v40 and I've taken from this community that diesel is not the way to go. 

Commute distance is roughly 40 miles each way and the journey would be completed once or twice per week. I don't believe that a diesel car would be worthwhile for this distance so I am looking at petrol. 

A few questions about these cars. Is the mileage high and, if so, what kind of repairs/upkeep will I be expected to make in the near future. I am aware I should ask about belt changes due to the mileage?

Would you say that these are relatively good cars? I am looking to keep for a minimum of four years with any further years being a bonus and during that time I might have an addition to the family. 
Safety is my biggest concern and these cars appear to be quite safe. 

For this price point (under 10,000) would you say that these cars are worthwhile or are there other suggestions that you'd recommend? (such as upkeep or mileage on a golf). 

I also see many great looking v40vas imports from Japan and wonder if this is viable? I hear that they need to have rust proofing if they are to be kept in the UK but is there any other concerns for an import? Their MOT method looks robust.

So I came across a post 2 years ago regarding this topic on this sub which was largely negative towards electric and I essentially just wanted to see if anythings changed. We require a medium sized LWB van

So the factors in my case with a work vehicle to consider are 

\- Mainly work in central London, (50-60 miles per day, very heavy traffic). We do work on projects up to 140-200 miles total a day as well   
\- Most of our clients would prefer us and eventually expect us to be following a green initiative and getting an electric vehicle   
\- We would be carrying our tools and equipment every day (around 250-300kg) with materials ranging from anything around 100kg-600kg 

We know we will definitely have to get a Euro6 to avoid ULEZ if we do go diesel and with the no congestion fare for electric vehicles ending shortly it's a cost we now have to consider anyway. 

The first thing I came across was a eTransporter and it's 81mile range and 56mph limit being absolutely laughable I have since found suitable LWB vans with ranges around 200 miles that seem more attractive and they are advertised as being cheaper to run and maintain than their diesel counterparts, however I am ignorant and a bit sceptical of the truth behind this.

Any and all advise would be greatly appreciated and with this being a ""cartalk"" sub I hope my post is okay being posted here

You can get 40 miles electric and about 500 petrol. You can even ask it to use the electricity later so when you arrive in london it will be still charged for the traffic.

Cielo11 (Score: 16): Never owned an Electric van to be clear. I have nothing against the idea of Electric, but the technology just doesn't seem to be there yet for heavy Commercial use.

I have 2 small delivery businesses and run small vans, I do 7 hours a day M-Sat, and 3 on Sundays. I looked into Electric 2 years ago, the impression I got about about Electric from the drivers who used them (DPD, Amazon peeps) wasn't great. Reliability of new tech, cost of parts and repairs, Range, Winter issues. A lot of the newer vans I see appearing for those companies, seems to all be Diesel... hmmm (commuter suburban area, not inner city).

Everything you described in your post sounds like too much for an Electric van sadly.

Heavy traffic, heavy load weight, daily running, 200 miles a day. At the very very least you would need 100% at the start of the day, full eco driving and fingers crossed. But I suspect you'd need to factor in a charge up at lunch time. How much might that cost if its using fast charge stations, how much time would that cost?

My vans are like generators, they are working all day and they HAVE to be reliable and trustworthy. I'm just not sure electric has that ability... yet.

If you'll only do motorways and motorways only, then yes it's a very frugal engine. And probably not experience many issues. This is based on the fact that you're the first owner. 

If you pop to the shop, school run, 10 min journeys here and there, then you'll be bankrupt. 

I have replaced so many things on my 1.6tdi it was cheaper for me to buy dealer diagnostics level tool and do calibrations, coding, diagnostics myself.

Expensive things I replaced were the following:

- all of the injectors, thousands
- EGR
- removed DPF and cleaned it professionally
- oil cooler
- thermostat housing 
- all sorts of sensors

1mt7rzs,Advice on options for selling financed car,"Hi, I will preface this by saying I don’t know too much about cars. 

I have a 10 year old Jaguar XE with 70k miles on the clock

Recently had a nightmare with some repairs, where I ended up only being able to get genuine parts and so the price was slightly eye watering. I have since been advised that it’s in my best interest to get rid of this car for anything else that will be more reliable +/ less expensive over the coming years. 

I am starting a new job next month which has an EV scheme with octopus, but I will not be eligible for that until either 3 or 6 months in - I’m comfortably in the 40% tax bracket so this may be a suitable option when the time comes. 

My car is being valued at 5.5k-7k through online evaluations, and I have about 5.5k left on the finance. 

What are my most sensible options? I’m okay with the idea of leasing cars for a period of time. 

Is it sensible to sell the current car, lease for 3/6 months, then consider the EV scheme?

First thing to do is check your agreement, I believe if you have paid 50% of the cars value on Hp/pcp then you are able to give the car back as a voluntary termination subject to your agreement terms.

You may find this a good option, subject to terms again you should be able to sell a PCP/hp car to anyone but generally motorway or Carwow are best and they settle outstanding finance.

Question is - if someone will give you more £ for the car than the finance outstanding? If yes do it! If no then voluntary termination is better.

The other question is how comfortable are you without a car, can you use a bicycle, public transport or share with a friend for a few months, if not you may have to have try and keep the car for the 3months and suck up any additional repairs"
