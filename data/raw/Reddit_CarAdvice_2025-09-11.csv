1ndtx91,Rat in my car. Please help.,"Not a mechanic issue, sorry for the long post.

As title, I got a rat in the car, I dont it’s been that long because I clean the engine bay pretty often, and haven’t noticed anything strange. 

Last week, I opened the hood as usual to clean the engine bay and notice some droppings on top of the engine, then I used strong flash light to inspect the engine bay. Sure enough I discovered a bunch of left over seed and nut on the plastic cover. I removed plastic cover and clean out all food, droppings, give the engine bay a quick wipe (I haven’t hosed it down yet because I’m a little scare doing so. 

Since then, I check the engine bay every day and haven’t seen any droppings, but still sometimes see some a little rat poops here and there.

My concern it, I’m not sure if the little guy has nested in the car or not. The car still functions normal and no weird smell, at least for now. 

I have used peppermint spray but I don’t dont think it does the job, rat still keeps coming back and forth. I’m getting a bunch of trap types today and try to catch this little guy.  In the mean time I’m trying to locare it’s nest if there is one. I daily drives this car, I check engine bay every morning and still couldn’t trace the nest. Where should I look at now? Like even if I successfully catch him, I still have to clean the nest somehow. This drives me nut.

Any input would be greatly appreciated.

Check your engine codes with a paper clip. It can help a lot. (Especially with injector equipped models)

My 90 was dining super rich and I was trying to figure out what if many things was causing this issue. I stumbled on a way of checking check engine lights and figured out I had a left oxygen sensor issue. (It was sending a message telling the engine it was running lean so the injectors kept throwing more gas than it needed)

So, to figure out what check engine light codes you have all you need is a paper clip. Use the paper clip to short the two pins in the upper right corner of your obd1 port. Then switch your key to the on position. Your check engine light should blink once then twice, giving you code 12 telling you you are in diagnostics mode. It will do this three times. Then it will flash your code (if it’s a two digit code the first set of flashes will be the first part of the number and then the next series will be the latter part of the number). It will then give you code 12 three times and move on to the next error code or repeat the first error code if you only have one."

TlDR; keep the 2 batteries for $92, or keep the straight die grinder and batteries for $200, but I really want a right angle die grinder so do I sacrifice for a free die grinder with my batteris
So Milwaukee dropped a banger for 2 batteries i have been praying for on sale, and a free straight die grinder thats brand new, and is wayyy better than the gen 1 grinders, both angle and straight got a remake.

What im wondering from you guys is this; I really want the right angle grinder as my first die grinder tool i would own.

I have had needs to use a burrito for gouging/shaping wood, ive had the need to sand in tight spaces, same with polishing in intricate spaces, I am a woodworker as well and have some uses there such as a kutzall bit for shaping, again sanding, whatever comes up.

So the batteries would only cost my $92 if I give up the straight die grinder. And thats great cause thats what I want in this deal.

If I keep the die grinder, which is $230 by itself, plus batteries at normal price are $240, thats $470 if I bought them normally, and my current price I paid for both of them is $200.

So, is the straight good enough that I should keep it, or am I gonna be in a situation where I dont really know what im missing if I keep it and dont get a right angle anytime soon?",1,1757546794.0,7,MechanicAdvice,1757619180,2025-09-10 23:26:34,2025-09-11 19:33:00,"Ianthin1 (Score: 1): I can’t help you with the math, but I have the right angle and it’s one of my favorite tools.

Have had it for about a week without issue and yesterday she said she was accelerating out of a drive-thru and heard a ""pop"" and then had trouble with acceleration. I'm not mechanically inclined but listening to it it sounded like an air leak. I popped the hood and noticed the hose coming off the back of the air filter housing was barely hanging on and the clamp was loose. I tightened it back down and took it for a test drive confident that I had fixed it. Same issue, ""whooshing"" with acceleration and no real power. When I pop the hood again is when I noticed the missing shroud/cover you see in the first picture. 

I thought maybe it was pulling too much air into the engine and causing issues? Of course it triggered all kinds of warnings including reduced engine power. Anyways, got it back to the VW dealership in hopes that they would just be replacing that plastic shroud but they're saying that the turbo needs replaced. I told them the above and inquiried if this could have caused all the error messages which led them towards diagnosing it as a faulty turbo. Basically he told me they would replace the shroud but there's no way it would pull enough air to cause engine issues and the turbo was definitely going to need replacement regardless. 

Genuinely, forgive my ignorance but I'm just wondering if this sounds plausible? I would think you would replace the $50-100 plastic part and see if that alleviates the issue before replacing the entire turbo.

1ndtag7,02 Lexus ES300 Misfire and Oil Leak Into Spark Plugs and Intake Manifold Help!,"Vehicle: 2002 Lexus ES300
Engine: 1MZ-FE 3.0L V6

Problems:
——————
- I bought the car in late July, on the road it misfired really really bad and we went home and started work on it. Spark Plugs needed to be replaced, so we replaced those. However, 2 of the spark plugs were covered in oil. We replaced the spark plug tube seals, and the valve cover gasket. This was finished in early August.

- For a while, the car still ran like crap, it misfired more and more often, and then my car broke down like a week ago. We looked at the spark plugs, and some of them were loose. So we torqued them back in and continued to dig deeper, the same spark plugs that were covered in oil were covered in new oil.

- After finding this out, we looked at the gaskets for the intake manifold, and those were covered in oil, I will attach a photo of those seals and the intake manifold itself in the comments. I also looked at the PCV Valve, and it looked in pretty poor condition. I will attach an image showing the old one in the comments, I bought a new one from NAPA.

- I tried looking for the upper and lower gaskets for the intake manifold, but only found the lower ones. This had me stuck, so I ended up calling a Lexus dealership, called the parts section and asked some questions. The guy there said that for the intake manifold, unless you are doing coolant work, the only gaskets that must be replaced are the upper ones, which connects to the throttle body. He also said that the reason the misfiring is happening because of the broken seals in the intake manifold. He suggested that I replace the valve cover gaskets with OEM ones, as the blue aftermarket ones never fit and will cause oil to leak. He suggested that I replace:

1. Replace aftermarket valve cover gaskets with OEM ones.
2. Replace intake manifold upper gasket with new OEM ones.
3. Replace PCV Valve, which I did.

- Also, the car alarm goes off after I lock the car and it happens every ~3-8 hours, we looked at the o2 sensor but couldn’t really tell from appearance, we also looked for the door ajar light to come on in the dash when locking the doors, but it didn’t come on which tells me that the sensors for the doors are good, the sensor for the trunk is good too, so I assume that it is the hood, I am unsure of what to do for that, and I am assuming that it has something to do with the engine problems so I set it aside.

So, I want to know what to do. If you have any questions please ask. If there are any more pictures you want, please ask. Thank you.

1ndsny5,Changed my spark plugs on my used vehicle. Carbon or oil build up on the spark plug. 2019 Jeep Cherokee. Limited. 2.0 Turbo.,"Hello, I bought my 2019 jeep cherokee limited 2.0 turbo at roughly 48,000 miles. I am now at 85,000 and changing the spark plugs (The motor began misfiring while I was driving, drove it to a mechanic who diagnosed it as spark plugs and ignition coils in chamber 2 and 3. He reset the codes and i got about a half mile from home before it began misfiring again) along with the ignition coils in all 4 chambers. The tip of plug 3 looked a little wet and had more carbon build up than the others. Does this indicate an issue with the seals? Or the vehicle running rich? Or could this be from the misfiring/then sitting? I do not know if and when the spark plugs or coils had ever been changed prior to this. The vehicle sat without running for roughly 6 weeks before I was able to get the OEM coils in. I have not started the vehicle since replacing everything. The battery was dead, getting it charged at autozone tomorrow. Any help would be appreciated! Thank you! 

The ceramic of the plugs and chambers where the ignition coils sit were free of debris and oil. Perfectly clean.

I didn't drive the car too far after getting it repaired outside of my work commute, but I assumed everything was fine. Decided to drive to the beach over the weekend and was driving through the mountains to get there. The driving was semi-spirited but nothing crazy, but I started to notice a burning smell. I pull over in a mountain town to check the smell, turn the car off and engage the parking brake (as I was on an incline) and get out to see what's going on. I follow the smell and notice my rear brakes are smoking. The rear rotors at this point have a blue discoloration and were still smoking from the heat. The front rotors were hot but weren't smoking and weren't blue. I decide to let the brakes cool off for about 30 minutes before trying to drive off. Unfortunately as I try and reverse to leave, the car doesn't move. I assume the rear brakes have seized up at this point. I call a towtruck and tow it home. Rear tires are locked when getting it towed. Reach out to the shop and let them know what happened, he tells me it's unlikely that both brakes seized, and that is was likely that I was ""driving with the parking brake on"" but told me to bring it in. I was confused by this, as I know the parking brake wasn't on while driving, and the parking brake light on my dash clearly turned on when I engaged the parking brake as I pulled over to park and check on the car.



I had it towed to the shop last night, and he sends me a text last night saying ""Got you car on the rack, one of your rear brake caliper piston is seized up. Seems like previous owner ran on the pads too low for a while and caused the caliper piston to get seized. I'll check tomorrow to see availability for the caliper, other side doesn't look so good either. If you want to change both rear calipers"" I was confused and alarmed by this as well because in my mind, this is something the shop should have noticed when working on my car. I don't respond as it was late, but I woke up this morning to a text with a few pictures(see attached) and the shop owner saying ""When you drove with the parking brake on, it melted the brake pads to the rotors""

  
So I'm confused. What happened here and who is at fault? Why is the shop owner changing his story?  I feel like the shop owner is trying to avoid liability on their end by passing the blame on to me, but I also could be retarded so I am asking here before I respond to him. Do you think there was a chance I somehow was driving with the parking brake on, even though the light on the dash wasn't on? Does it seem more likely the shop made a mistake when doing the brakes, or is it my mistake? I've already spent way more than I should to repair this car, so I would appreciate any and all feedback, thanks for your help guys.

Give the exhaust a good look around. ChrisFix I believe has a great video on YT on how to find an exhaust leak I highly recommend watching.

1ndnhsc,"Loud Pop Sound, What Could It Be?","Hello guys!

I bought a 2017 Honda Civic touring from, what I now think, a shady dealership. It has just under 73,000 miles on it as of this posting. The car’s sensor bracket in the front is damaged from a previous accident that was undisclosed and not on the title before I bought it. But that’s not the largest pressing matter.

Pretty recently I have noticed that there is a loud, almost popping noise, that sounds like it’s coming from the upper drivers side whenever I turn on uneven ground or when there is any torque added to a turn. Additionally, this sound also happens when driving on bumpy or uneven surfaces. When the sound happens, I swear I can feel it in the pedal, especially when turning.

I went into two different shops to see if they could see what was wrong. They agreed that it might have something to do with the engine mount, since it was pretty roughed up. They said that the axels, and struts looked good. They were able to slide my engine mount back to where it’s supposed to sit in my car, and then they tightened all of the bolts around the car. They weren’t sure if that was the issue, but she ran a lot better after that, and the sound was very infrequent and quiet if it even happened. However, as I’ve been driving on her more, the sound is almost back to the same volume and frequency as before. I really can’t afford to keep taking her into the shop, paying the diagnostic fees, and then paying for repairs that aren’t going to fix the issue. 

Any ideas on what it could be? I’m getting super frustrated with the persistence of the issue, and any info would be greatly appreciated!!",1,1757531649.0,2,MechanicAdvice,1757619180,2025-09-10 19:14:09,2025-09-11 19:33:00,"SlowDownToGoDown (Score: 1): I would be curious if the [strut bearing](https://www.rockauto.com/en/moreinfo.php?pk=12876821&cc=3436819&pt=7600&jsn=584) is damaged on the LH side, causing the issue.  

On your car, when you turn the steering wheel, the strut assembly (damper + spring) rotates.  It's fixed into the knuckle at the bottom, and at the top, there is a bearing that the spring nestles into, and the other side is bolted to the car.  

I've changed mine when I've done suspension jobs on my car.  You have to pull the strut assembly, compress the spring, and then replace the strut bearing assembly, then reinstall the strut assembly.  

You are doing a bit of forensic work here (or your shop is), trying to see if anything from whatever collision the car was in at some point damaged something.

1ndhyv7,Questionable End Result from an Audi garage in the UK,"I recently took my 2008 diesel Audi A4 into a local Audi garage in the UK to have the wheel locking nuts replaced and as part of the service, they offered to address a couple of recalls which I naturally said yes to assuming they would be positive for the car. They were both emissions based.

  
After a horrendously long wait and terrible customer service, I drove away to find a particulate filter error message on my dashboard (there were no warning lights or error messages prior to dropping it off). There was also a huge decrease in the car's ability to accelerate (I believe due to it now essentially being in limp mode to protect itself).

I took it back and they reviewed it over the weekend and into this week. They've finished their checks and have diagnosed that the diesel particulate filter needs replacing. The parts alone costing £2,400...

  
My question is, has anything dodgy happened here or is this legit? I had an MOT the previous week and nothing was flagged regarding emissions however now the DPF needs replacing? According to the garage, the error message was stored in the car's memory however surely something that could determine whether a car passes or fails it's MOT should be all over the dashboard and not stored in the background?

You could try leaving it off for 15 and seeing if the error goes long enough for you to floor it down the motorway to try clear the DPF out. Do you do much motorway driving? Ask them also what is the problem - why does it need replacing. You can get people to come round and clean your DPF filter for a fraction of that price.

1ndgm6s,"GX 460 Brand new transmission shudder, milkshake damage","200K mile 2012 GX 460, transmission was on its way out. Learned from GX people that these did not come with transmission coolers, many don't change ATF, and they die. Don't know how the PO treated it, but it was slipping all the time, so I ordered a Lexus remanned transmission and had a mechanic put it in. The second time I drove it - on about mile 40 - it shuddered badly on a low-throttle shift from 3rd to 4th. I parked it, intending to do a drain and fill, suspecting the guy had not put enough ATF in. But the level wasn't the problem; a strawberry milkshake came out. PO had replaced the radiator 4 yrs/45K miles ago (date and mileage sharpied on it, thanks dude), but maybe he used a crappy amazon brand. All I can figure is that the new trans had a higher line pressure and ruptured a weak weld in the radiator?

I replaced the radiator and pumped all the ATF out, until it was only new fluid coming out. Took about 12 quarts. Topped it off, ran it for 50 miles, dropped the pan, replaced the filter, topped it off. There was a very small amount of pink in the bottom of the pan, maybe enough to fill the cap of a coke bottle. The magnets left black streaks on the towel, no sparklies or dirt in the fluid.

It still shudders at low-throttle gear changes, especially 3-4. Shifts great if I'm stepping on it, or if I completely let off the throttle.

I don't know transmissions very well. Did the glycol/water ruin clutches? Or did they ruin the TC somehow? is it possible that another few hundred miles of good ATF will clean out whatever pockets of contamination are still in there, or is this 50 mile transmission dead? I can't stand the thought of buying another new one...If I took it out myself, should I just replace the clutches, or just the TC, or both? I think the new trans had a 12 month warranty but I assume it wouldn't cover a radiator contamination like this.

Lots of questions, thank you to the wise transmission people out there.

Photos from the internet/I was too mad to take pics of the strawberry milkshake. It looked just like that though.

I started on the radiator due to the urgency, I disconnected the negative terminal, removed the radiator fan, and then the radiator. I realized I had extra room in the engine bay, and figured now would be the easiest time to replace the precat as well. 
I disconnected both 02 sensors, and the alternator. To get the long bottom alternator bolt out, I loosened the fuse box and lifted up on this. 
I then removed and reinstalled the manifold, alternator etc. 
I decided to finish the radiator install today, but had left one of the windows open and there was expected rain. I reconnected the negative battery terminals, which arced a little bit, and then went to close the window but the car was completely dead. I checked voltage and the battery is fine, but I blew the 120 Amp Battery fuse built into the positive terminal. 

I am assuming if I buy a new one, I will blow that as well due to damaged wiring. What are the chances that it just happened to blow, versus there is a short somewhere? Figuring there is a short, how do I start tracking and determining where this may be from? 

Note, I did not reinstall the radiator fans, so those plugs were open, but I wouldn’t think that would have anything to do with I. Any ideas of what to do or where to start?

The other cable is the starter solenoid/ starter wire. These are about the only 2 wires that could blow 120 amps.

Hi. First time poster with little mechanical knowledge/skills. 26M.

My 2015 Volkswagen Take Up! (1.0L) is underperforming in fuel economy. Getting an average of 45-50 MPG rather than 60+ MPG as expected.

I drive carefully (hypermilling), regularly check pressure, don't carry a roof rack etc.

I have tested the MPG in fairly consistent conditions.

I suspect I may be able to raise the MPG to its expected levels with some mechanical maintenance. Such as:

Clean fuel injectors
Replace spark plugs
Replace air filter
Replace oil / oil filter

Head gasket?","Hey folks, looking for some advice on my 2018 Ford Escape Ecoboost 1.5 (slight ragrets). I just hit 98,000 and been chasing a bunch of issues that I think they’re all connected. Over the last couple weeks I’ve had intermittent misfire codes (mainly cylinder 3) and even a crankcase ventilation code. Mechanic mentioned valve cover gasket and maybe a crank sensor, but nothing definitive. I also had my spark plugs replaced recently, and they came out with noticeable moisture on them.

At the same time, my coolant keeps slowly disappearing with no obvious leaks. Lately, when the car sits all day (like when I’m at work), it’s a hard start and then I get a huge cloud of white exhaust that smells sweet. After that, it clears up and drives fine. This has been happening more often.

Also, when I park and shut the car off, I’ve been hearing some pretty loud gurgling running through the driver and passenger side, even when I don’t run the AC the whole drive. I’ll try to put a video in the comments. 

From what I’ve read, it sounds like a head gasket letting coolant seep into a cylinder, but I’d love some outside opinions. Does this look/sound like early head gasket failure? And if so, would something like Bar’s Leak be worth trying just to buy time, or is that a waste of money at this point? Video attached of the smoke from this morning too.

1ndppje,Engine Light On: O2 vs. CAT?,"I have a 2004 Honda Truck CR-V 4WD 2.4L FI DOHC 4cyl. Close to 150k in mileage. Regularly maintained. A couple of weeks ago, the engine light came on (steady, orange color). I have been given the following codes:

P0138 - Bank 1 sensor 2 downstream oxygen sensor fault  
P0420 - CAT converter fault  
P1456 - Evap leak detected (not a current condition...could have been a cap loose and has since been tightened).

Shop recommends changing the oxygen sensor to clear codes and if it doesn't resolve the issue, replacing the CAT converter.  They also saw the brake wires are covered in grease so axles might be leaking grease and may need to be replaced. Car isn't making any noise when I make sharp turns.

Another mechanic suggested that I use a Fule Injector Cleaner with a half tank, drive the car for a while and see if that resolves the issue before I invest in anything major. Is there a downside to this?

EVAP: see if it comes back after erasing the code.

Cat efficiency monitoring is done via O2 sensors, so they are not wrong in trying to fix the O2 sensor issue  first. It could be not only a sensor fault but also wiring etc, so it probably needs further diagnosis, not just reading fault codes. (Although if the shop rate is expensive enough, it might be cheaper to install a new sensor and see if it has fixed the issue.) Maybe get a second opinion on this O2 sensor issue, let them to do the measurements etc as necessary (which takes time so a diag fee is to be expected). 🤔 The cat fault is probably popping up because of the sensor measuring wrong.  By removing the O2 sensors the cat could be inspected with a borescope camera. Actual efficiency of the cat can be measured at the tailpipe - I live in the EU and they check it at every inspection so I’d just go there and ask them to do this measurement if deemed necessary for the diagnosis, I guess this depends on where you live and what’s accessible locally (so like I’ve mentioned it might be easier to replace the O2 sensor and see if that fixed the problem or not)."

1ndmozv,"Did I fail as a good Samaritan, leaving this person on the side of the road? How could I have fixed this?","I write this story with a heavy heart and feeling guilty.



Last night I was driving home on a 500 miles trip with about 100 miles to go. It was around 1:00 am, and I was needing to take a break and stretch, so I pulled into a rest area off of I-20 near Dallas. As I pulled in, I noticed a man that was getting up off the ground, and at first I thought he was drunk and had passed out. I stayed in my truck and observed for a while to get an assessment of the situation. Eventually, I realized the man was disabled and had a cast on one of his legs. He hobbled slowly over to his car, and I could see that he had a flat tire and was trying to put on his spare, but was not strong enough to break the lugs and had found a rock to bang the tire iron with, which is what he was doing on the ground when I first saw him.



As soon as I realized the situation, I got out and approached them man to see if he wanted my help. The man had clear health issues and was visibly in distress. He was glad to let me help and asked me if I had a hammer to help him break his lug nuts with. I told him I had something far better; I had an electric impact wrench.



In my truck I carry quite an array of emergency tools for my own-self and to also offer help to people in need. I have this cool kit that includes a heavy duty electric jack that doubles as an air compressor, and the kit includes this amazing electric impact wrench that makes getting even the hardest lugs off a breeze. So, I was sure that I could get this man fixed up.



I first tried airing up his tire, only to find it had too fast of a leak to hold air. Then I got ready to get his tire off. After hooking my electric impact wrench to his car battery, I went to find the correct socket to fit his lugs, and that is when I saw it. The dreaded KEYED lug nut. I asked the man if he had keyed lug socket, and he did not even know what I was talking about. I spent the next half an hour searching every conceivable place in his car where it could be, and it was nowhere to be found. That is when I had to give him the bad news that I had no way to get his tire off.



The man seemed so desperate that it was almost like he could not hear what I was saying. He begged me not to leave him stranded there, and then hobbled off to the cars of other people asking to borrow their keyed lug socket, even after I tried to explain to him that they are all unique, and they would not work. I did not know what to do. I just waited for over half an hour for him to give up and come back.



When he finally came back, I explained to him that he needed professional help and if he did not have any other person to call, he could call the 800 number on the back of his Texas driver's license to get help. He said that his phone was dead and asked if he could charge it in my truck before I left. I went and got my $40 charger and cord and just gave it to him and said, ""You need this a whole lot more than I do."" I apologized profusely for not being able to more, but it felt like for hollow and useless words to say to someone who was in real need.



Driving away and leaving that man there was one of the hardest things I have had to do. It ripped my heart out. I felt like a complete failure. Not only because I was not able to help him, but because I did not know HOW to help him. A deep anger against these stupid keyed lug nuts started brewing in my heart. I mean, when the heck do they put these things on budget cars with cheap OEM rims anyway? Is there really a rash of thieves stealing old tires on cheap rims? I mean, I could understand if you had a $4,000 set of custom rims and tires on your car, but OEM rims on a Hyundai Accent? Come on, son!



I don't know if it was the fact that I had only had four hours sleep in the last 48 hours and was mentally exhausted, or that I had a quart of Arizona green tea with gensing and a 24 oz cup of coffee in me, but I started crying as drove away. I am still bothered by it today, and I would just like to hear from some car and tire experts if there was any way around this problem. Is there some trick to getting these lugs off that I did not think of. I am pretty good at MacGyvering myself around problems, but I could not think of anything I could do on the side of the road last night. How do tire shops get these things off without damaging the rim?

1ndkwxm,Got sold a Salvage but told it was clean,"Sorry for the long post but it’s been bothering me for a while now and would really appreciate advice on what to do. 
To start, I 23M bought a car off Facebook marketplace. I looked around for a while and stumbled upon a 2008 Honda Civic LX 4D for $2300.
It was my first time ever buying a car so I brought a friend with me.
The car was a beater it runs great but it has 200k miles and cosmetically its ugly. I didn’t care about that though cause it runs and for $2300? What more can I ask for. 
Problem is. The guy who sold it to me said it was a clean title, my dumbass really should have did my research thoroughly cause he didn’t give me a pink slip he just said to take the bill of sale to the DMV and they’ll get me one under my name, my dumbass believed him. 
So I did… I found out it was a salvaged there and it needed to be inspected for the lights and brakes. I messaged him and he was nice about it and said he’s willing to give me a refund but I have to wait for about a week for his next paycheck. Long story short, he ghosted me. 
Now I’m stuck with a salvaged car that needs inspections. I had it inspected for $300 and learned that theres a lot wrong with it. I had started fixing some of the problems with the help of a friend. But I’m close to spending about $2000 on it. This was my first time buying and it just had to be like this… I know I have no one else to blame but myself… it’s just infuriating.. 
My main question is, can I take any legal actions on the guy? He has a business and I don’t know if even allowed to say it here… he said he picks up cars from repo yards. Is there anyway to get him to pay me back all the stuff I paid on it to get it registered? 
This whole ordeal took away my trait of thinking the best of off people. Its made me doubtful of people and sorry to say… I hate generalizing but it’s made me suspicious of his ethnicity in general, I know there’s bad people on every ethnicity but this whole ordeal is giving me so much stress that it’s honestly draining… thank you to anyone who reads this.

Basically use some heat starting at a corner and slowly peel it off using more heat and the plastic scrapers if needed. Once it’s all off, you want to use some chemicals to remove the adhesive residue left. Goo gone, goof off, etc. are good for removing that stuff.

If you’re not super good with similar stuff, I’d pay the $100-ish it would cost to have it retinted. I feel I’m skilled with similar stuff, but I’d still have someone else tint my windows. And you’d probably save a lot of time and pain by asking them to remove the old, too."

I went back to the tire place and they told me they hear it, but they don’t know what it is. I went back another day for a different mechanic to listen to it by their request, and they’re saying they think it’s a hub (?). This I have learned is very expensive.

It seems strange to me that it could be this, when my car had never made a noise like this or otherwise before. 

My uncle said maybe the tires need to break in but it has been 500 miles now.

The sound drives me crazy.  I should also note the tires I got are a white label of a Bridgestone tire. They have an A rating.

If the coolant is a different color than what it calls for dont mix it. You will need to remove the thermostat to flush all the old stuff out. 

PS: most vehicles take about 1.5gallons+ so its cheaper to buy concentrate and make 2 gallons out it rather than buying a 50/50 premixed solution. The premix is around $17 and concentrate is around $21. So it would be around $35 for 2 gallons of premixed and only $22 for 2 gallons of concentrate.

In February of 2024 I needed to get my passenger side (right?) boot replaced after hitting a plastic gas can that flew out of a landscaping trailer.  I needed new tires and knew a wheel alignment would be needed after I replaced the boot since the car was pulling a bit.  Well, they don't make just the boot, had to have the axle replaced.  I wanted it all done in one visit so, no tire place then repair shop.  I got 3 estimates and went with the one where they actually looked at the car, got the VIN, showed me what tires I had, what they had, made comparisons the whole 9 yards.  They weren't the most expensive nor where they the cheapest but they were the ones who listened and actually worked with me.

Last month I needed brakes and when they were being done I was told that the right boot was in really bad shape.  I brought the car to the dealer for some warranty repairs and asked them to let me know if the axle  was an original part or a replacement.  They never said which it was but the passenger side axle was replaced and the ""bumper to bumper"" warranty actually covered for it.  Now the one thing I do know, or at least thought I did, is that a warranty will not pay for a part that was replaced only the original parts.  I have the estimate and the paid invoice for the work.  It was not a mom and pop repair shop.

Brake issue is thus... driving normally then I'd hit the brakes and it would be super stiff and not so the car at all, stopping by coasting. At times it would even lock up so much to where the engine would shut off by itself. So we were advised to replace the brake booster. Replaced it and the complete opposite happened now. Hitting the brakes was super spongy. When we would drive, the brake would barely bounce and it would stop the car from accelerating. Trying to push the gas pedal, to the floor and nothing hairband... slowing down more. Have to flick the brake leak up by our foot to get it back into place.

If the vehicle hasn’t been intentionally modified and just has the wrong parts installed/isn’t running properly, then properly repairing the vehicle and bringing it back to the factory/OE setup is going to give you a good baseline.  

However, Honda didn’t build the car for optimum fuel economy.  They built it to cover a wide variety of uses, with fuel economy being one of the considerations of the overall design.

Get the coolant flushed out and replaced, it's over 10 years old...so it needs to be changed out.  This will prevent your water pump and thermostat from corroding to death, which prevents overheating and loss of the engine.  Coolant no longer protects against corrosion after a certain number of years.


Same thing with the brake fluid.  Needs to be flushed and bled due to age.  Brake fluid absorbs moisture readily and that moisture can cause failures of the ABS system.  Expensive module.


Engine serpentine belt(s) all need to be changed because they're also 12 years old.  This will help keep you from getting stranded on the side of the road if the belt snaps.


Make sure you put good tires on it.  Have one of the shops inspect the tires and check the age.  All this maintenance won't matter if you skid off the road (or wreck into another vehicle) because your tires are old, bald, or dry rotted.

2: Get the highest price from the other party and then give them the car. Maryland's property damage limit is $15,000. The other party has already spent around $900 on towing and car rentals, so I'm not sure what the maximum I can get.

Accomplished_Horse48 (Score: 5): The first question I would ask is how confident do you feel in your ability to learn and do service to the car yourself? After that, the engine itself probably requires very little. Air in (intake), compression, ignition, air out (exhaust)…this is all engines require fundamentally. Easier to remember suck, squeeze, bang, blow.

Also what type of car is it? Make, model, engine type, fuel type?

To start I would check

Engine: 
Make sure the intake is clear and filter in good condition

Replace/clean spark/glow plugs

Check the fuel condition, if it’s been sitting for a year on a full tank, it’s most likely stale. Drain/siphon the fuel out and start fresh…DO NOT TRY TO START IT WITH THE STALE FUEL. This will gum up and push stale fuel through the ignition and fuel lines. (Ultimately it’s not the end of the world, but it will make your life starting the car 10x harder) 

I would check and potentially replace fluids such as oil, coolant, brake fluid, clutch (if applicable…uses the same fluid as brakes)

The rest of car just make sure the tires are not dry rotted, no punctures, good tread, and aired up properly. 

Check the brake condition, life/longevity, and make sure they are not seized. 

And probably the most important…battery condition. Check the charge/health of the battery and either add electrolytes and charge, or replace the battery. 

All in all this is probably over the top for what all will actually need doing to the car to get it to run. 
To get it running to move it not far, you probably just need to add good fuel and a stabilizer to the tank and rock the car to make sure it mixes well. Check the plugs and make sure they are in good condition, then get a jump. The rest of the car you car truly worry about once you get it moved and can begin going through it."

Engine light has been on so took it to the garage (chain garage in the UK that also has retail stores in case it's relevant). They read the error code as the O2 sensor bank 1, sensor 1. Replaced the sensor for £400. Engine light has come back on immediately so I took it back. They then told me the fuel I'm using is to blame. Its supermarket fuel... Are they seriously telling me that the majority of the UK are driving round with the engine light on?! 

Anyway I Google it and see that this error code can be multiple things including the catalytic converter. I drop the car back off today and lo and behold there is now a new error code that is telling them it's just that!

1ndiwqw,Can (and should I) I fix my own car scratches?,"The car is a red Kona 2019 (automatic), a formerly used car that's driven about 60 000 kilometers so far.

I'm sorry if this is a stupidly basic question, but i've only owned a car for half a year so I have very little foundation to work on. And in case this isn't the right subreddit to ask such a question, i'd love to know where else.

Now, to my highly untrained eyes, these scratches look like they're really not a big deal, and something one *should* be able to fix relatively easily. However, when actually asking a local car fixer how much this would cost to fix via them... I get told i'd need to pay 1200$, which to me either sounds like the damage is worse than it looks and not something I should try to fix, or that the car fixer simply takes a stupidly unreasonable markup for everything minor. Note that I live in Norway, so insane markups for people trying to avoid minor conveniences wouldn't be that weird, but I can't say for sure whether this is such a case.

Note it's not like I can't pay 1200$, but that's certainly not an amount of money I like spending on something I could learn to do myself with relatively minor efforts. Especially on account of learning this sort of thing perhaps being useful in the future as well.

So basically... is this something I could fix relatively easily myself, despite being a total beginner?

IMO if it’s the wheel cylinder leaking, you can probably DIY though on a Silverado, rear drum work can be a bit tricky because the springs and adjusters can fight you if you’re not used to them.  DIY with patience, a good spring tool, and a brake cleaner spray.

Those filters are performance filters that allow more airflow at the cost of worse filtration. Stock airboxes are engineered for the engine, so typically switching to the other filter will yield worse results. Your truck looks older but may have already been a cold air induction system, as a lot already are. The noise comes from more air moving, the best way to reduce that is to put the stock filter back. Only time this yields decent results is if the vehicle is tuned for it

Edit:leaving the above because I didn't read the post fully, thats on me. If you cant get a stock to fit too well, then what you can do is try to isolate the filter from the rest of the engine bay, lay down some inexpensive insulation inside it (This might get gross over time). Make it a proper box, if you can cut into the fender and route it out, even better, that will make it actual cold air induction.

Would it be a bad decision, and will it cost me a lot to maintain in London? Would it hold its resale value if I plan to keep it for 2–3 years before selling?

⸻

NI based, M32. Budget ~£23k, would finance with £7k deposit.

We’ve got:
	•	2019 Peugeot 3008 (500L boot, ~50mpg).
	•	2018 VW Golf (wife’s).
	•	Drive 10–12k/year. Mostly short trips, plus a 250-mile round trip every few weeks to her parents.

Issue: When we go away with pets + luggage, the 3008 is already crammed. With a baby’s pram/cot/bags, it’ll be worse.

I’ve test driven Q5, X3, XC60, RAV4, Tiguan Allspace… and honestly the boot space felt no bigger than what I have. I like the X5 and Allspace, but most bigger SUVs are either too pricey, too big for my wife, or I don’t like the look (Kodiaq, Tarraco, Sorento, etc.). Not a fan of estates or MPVs.

Part of me thinks: just keep the 3008 (it’s worth ~£7k now, not losing much by holding onto it) and maybe get a roof box for trips. Other part of me wants to upgrade… or forget boot space altogether and buy something fun.

I think you'll find any suv, unless it's a 7 seater, won't swallow that much more than your 3008.  You'll also pay a lot more for it.

For your budget you could get a fairly new and fairly low mileage:
Skoda Octavia estate 
Toyota Corolla touring sports 
VW Passat estate 
A more premium German brand/brands if you don't mind going for an older and slightly higher mileage example.

It's your choice, but this is personally the route I would go. We previously had an SUV and got rid of it as we actually found it to be less practical. The boots are rarely bigger than the best hatchbacks, they're a pain to park and they generally feel like a boat drive.

In terms of not knowing the speed limit - I always assume a speed limit is 30 mph unless sign posted otherwise. It's worth keeping in mind that your speedo isn't correct - All car speedos over read so while you might think you're doing 20/30 you'll actually be doing less than this, a sat nav will show you a truer speed though.

If your car is showing 24 on the speedo and you're in a 20 zone and you go past a speed camera I'd say you're fine. Cameras are calibrated differently so if you're only doing 21/22 mph in real world speed I doubt it'd flash - I'd love to say that with absolute certainty but I don't know of anyone who's got a speed ticket by going 1-2 miles over the speed limit on real world speed.

For myself, I've gone past cameras like this and haven't had an issue. When I was learning though, I was too focused on the speedo. The more you drive the more instinctive speeds will become for you, I can easily hit 20/30/40 etc from muscle memory and the feedback of the pedals. Once you're used to it, you won't need to pay attention to the speedo as much. Its easier to get carried away in fast flowing traffic where everyone is doing the same speed but sadly, this speed is above the speed limit (not necessarily massively though) but still be conscious of the speed you're doing.

The important part to remember is that that you should drive safely. Don't be put off by cars behind you and feel forced to do something you don't deem to be safe. If they have to wait behind you then so be it. Providing you're driving to the speed limit and not doing 20 in a 30 then you've got absolutely nothing to worry about. I've been stuck behind traffic numerous times but they're doing the speed limit (more or less) and I'm in no rush so I just carry on driving and carrying on my karaoke.

You're also bound to make mistakes, this is how we learn and become better drivers. I've been driving a while and I still make the odd mistake from time to time - Does it make me a bad driver? No, shit just happens. I simply acknowledge it and carry on. It happens to everyone. Whoever tells you they NEVER make a mistake when driving is lying and I can guarantee you, If I were to tail them I'd be able to point it out.

Don't focus on the mistakes though, focus on the positives of your driving. I bet there's plenty of things you're doing correctly so give yourself credit. You'll always be learning as will I be and every other driver on the road.

If it makes you feel better too - I've scraped the occasional car when parking up out of my stupidity with misjudging things, I've made stupid errors in judgement when driving and the list carries on. I've acknowledged it and I'm a better driver as a result. I've learned from the mistakes and that's all you can do. A car is just a metal can at the end of the day, its not the end of the world - Providing you're not causing harm to someone else and causing a big accident it honestly isn't as bad as you feel. Yes it's shit but life carries on.

1ndof1n,Autoglass ADAS problem,"Hi all. I need some help. We had the windscreen on our Volvo V90 replaced today at Autoglass. The windscreen change went fine, but I noticed on the way home that the pilot assist on the car was pulling the car into the rumble strip at the edge of the motorway. I turned around at the next junction and took the car back. 

The guy told me that there is no ability to fine tune the calibration. That the computer does it and that's that. He then went on to tell me that it will keep calibrating itself for around the next 50-60 miles. I live 55 miles away from the autoglass and it did not get any better on the way home.

Reading around I can see this can be a problem with non OEM glass. We have contacted our insurance company and they are going to get back to us, but I've also read that a lot of times autoglass tries to fob this off.

Does anyone have any advice on the best way to approach this to get it sorted? The car is pulling so far left it's dangerous to use pilot assist.

1ndnvmp,The infamous 2021 Honda Civic 1.0,"So I’ve been driving my (relatively) trusty 2010 Citroen C1 since I passed my driving test at 17 years old, 6 years ago. So now I’m 23, out of uni and into full time work — I am FINALLY in a position to buy a Civic, which is a car I’ve been desperate to own for years. I set a budget, settled on a colour I like, booked some test drives, then found out about the dreaded wet belt. Literally felt like a stab in the chest. 

I have read a lot about the wet belts and how I should “avoid like Chernobyl” (thank you to whoever wrote that on an older post), but all posts about these are at least a couple years old. Could anyone possibly shed some light on these now we are a few years post the infamous 1.0 litre wet belt Civics? Does anyone have any experience with this specific car? Is it realistic to just maintain it regularly and never run into an issue or is it a ticking time bomb? There are so many good deals on these 1.0l 2021 Civics but I suppose that’s because of how engine failure is a common issue with them. I’m in a position where I don’t have to rush into buying a new car just yet, so I’d like some realistic and up to date advice. 

I’m also wondering whether Honda has acknowledged it? I have seen conflicting advice — some saying people have had free repairs, others saying it’s been completely dismissed by Honda.

\- The belt snaps well before the change interval with virtually no warning, valves hit pistons, and your engine is toast

Secondly the balance transfer is only to another credit card. if the card is for purchases and your using the card to pay for the car insurance just check that the insurance company takes the card and second of all make sure you set up a fixed monthly instalment to clear it off in 10-12 months. 

Regarding the car just make sure repair and maintenance costs is added to your budget. This is overlooked by a lot of drivers at the start

1ndkelj,"Just did 2400 miles from North West to Poland and back and absolutely loved every second of it, apart from Rastplatz areas in Germany. Always wanted to do an Eurotrip, and here are my thoughts:","- The only time someone flashed their lights at me or honked was in England, when I was doing 50 on a 50, funnily enough it happened twice, when I was driving there and when I was driving back. The 50 was permanent in circle on the motorway information board. 
- Our (English) service stations aren't as frequent as in Belgium, Holland, Germany and Poland, but are cleaner, more modern and most importantly free (and so are the Polish ones, everywhere else it's €1 PER PERSON). Can't speak of France as I was there for about 30 minutes before I reached Belgium and I haven't seen a single petrol station. 
- Petrol is so much more expensive in Belgium, Netherlands and Germany. Poland is on par with England. 
- There are free rest zones with toilets called ""Rastplatz"" in Germany but the state of those... Seriously the smell, the dirt, there was literally sh*t outside of them. 
- I don't expect everyone to speak English obviously, so I had to use live translate or show on my fingers I want to pay for pump no X at the petrol stations in Germany, or to get a coffee. Weirdly enough the closer I got to Berlin the worse it got with communication. No such issue in Netherlands, Belgium. Not sure about Poland, as I'm polish :-) 
- We have the worse roads here in England. Belgium and Netherlands motorways were so nice to drive on, Germany a mix of both nice and not so nicr, Poland unless you're on a motorway (and even then it's not always great), is still 20 years behind with their road quality. 
- The road manners are amazing in Germany, Belgium and Netherlands, England and Poland were the worst. Was so much fun to close the Speedo on autobahn (where allowed) :-) It's so nice to not see too many lane hoggers. I've found German drivers really nice and polite behind the wheel or when chatting at a Rastplatz etc. I talk a lot about Germany, because France was about 30 mins, Belgium and Netherlands about 1hr each to pass, and going West to East in Germany was about 9hrs so I've spent most of the time on autobahns there. 
- Surprisingly driving on the ""opposite side of the road"" was very easy, but that's probably because I'm a SUV wanker and can see clearly what's in front of me sitting higher up, unless there's a lorry. However there weren't too many of them and when they are there, they don't take up 3 lanes out of 4 overtaking each other. 
- The only place where I had to pay any kind of toll was a DART charge in England but you can avoid that slightly. The motorway from Dunkirk to Belgium (Antwerp) is free. So were the Motorways in Belgium, Netherlands and Germany. In Poland it depends on where you are going. 
- We have achieved close to 39 MPG with fully loaded boot and a family of 4 in a 2.2 tonne SUV with a 3.5L V6 and electric motors, on a motorway doing 70 MPH (apart from a couple of stints where I closed the Speedo on autobahn). I take that as a win. 
- It was the most comfortable drive I've had in any of the cars I've owned (including LS430 and 3GS450h!).
- There were a lot of chairs and 1(yes one) sofa on the ferry from Dover to Dunkirk (and back), so I would highly recommend either a small inflatable mattress or connecting chairs to form a bed if you want to take a nap on a ferry but it was cheaper than tunnel by about £130, plus you could stretch your legs, eat something at a restaurant and grab a hot drink.

1ndj182,Questionable End Result from an Audi garage in the UK,"I recently took my 2008 diesel Audi A4 into a local Audi garage in the UK to have the wheel locking nuts replaced and as part of the service, they offered to address a couple of recalls which I naturally said yes to assuming they would be positive for the car. They were both emissions based.

After a horrendously long wait and terrible customer service, I drove away to find a particulate filter error message on my dashboard (there were no warning lights or error messages prior to dropping it off). There was also a huge decrease in the car's ability to accelerate (I believe due to it now essentially being in limp mode to protect itself).

I took it back and they reviewed it over the weekend and into this week. They've finished their checks and have diagnosed that the diesel particulate filter needs replacing. The parts alone costing £2,400...

My question is, has anything dodgy happened here or is this legit? I had an MOT the previous week and nothing was flagged regarding emissions however now the DPF needs replacing? According to the garage, the error message was stored in the car's memory however surely something that could determine whether a car passes or fails it's MOT should be all over the dashboard and not stored in the background?

Is this all legit or has something dodgy happened and do I need to escalate further?",1,1757521799.0,2,CartalkUK,1757619180,2025-09-10 16:29:59,2025-09-11 19:33:00,"Apprehensive_Shoe_39 (Score: 2): > I had an MOT the previous week and nothing was flagged regarding emissions however now the DPF needs replacing? According to the garage, the error message was stored in the car's memory however surely something that could determine whether a car passes or fails it's MOT should be all over the dashboard and not stored in the background?

In regards to this the MOT will only check no lights (eg DPF/EML) on the dash and do a rudimentary check on emissions. Provided your car is not wildly off then it'll still pass, even if worse than comparable make/model/engines. So passing an MOT doesn't prove it was tip top.

I'm not saying they haven't screwed you over but there may be a lack of explaining/understanding. What's plausible is they mean it had an active logged fault from before you took it to Audi. Not enough to trip a warning light but enough that the car was aware, and has been for some time (it'll log the time/date). And, whether coincidence or through something they've done, when you drove it away the car has now decided this fault has got severe enough to light up a warning and put itself if limp mode.

That being said. You got some ""emission updates"". That would be the diesel gate update no doubt? If so, it's far too much of a coincidence. Maybe your old firmware was conscious, but allowed, whatever state your car was in to continue but this new firmware is much more strict and/or the acceptable parameters have changed. If that's the case then they really should have a way to check before applying the update. On the other hand, maybe your DPF was just about to die anyway. Hard one to judge.

I need help picking up my next first ""good"" car.



After months of reading reddit and online adds, I feel I'm getting decision fatigue. Please recommend me a good car that would last me at least the next 5 years with no major headaches.



Needs:



\- short trips around town, running errands, office drives, getting groceries, etc



\- occasional longer trips (+300km)



\- maybe once a year a long trip abroad (+1500km)



\- petrol (not opposed to diesel if the arguments are strong)



\- needs to have (or be able to add) apple car play



\- no roadsters, needs to be practical enough to haul enough luggage for ling trips abroad



\- automatic



\- fun to drive is a plus



\- Europe based



What I've considered so far is (list is not limited to these, please feel free to suggest others):



Hatchbacks/Sedans:



\- Mazda 3, 6: good reviews everywhere about the NA petrol engine



\- Seat Leon: same as Mazda, people usually praise the car, especially the FR trim



\- BMW series 3: more of a want than a need, looks good, but not sure about the reliability



\- Kia Pro C'eed: a bit out of my budget, but I would buy it in a heartbeat, really like it.

Estates:

- Mazda 6

- Ford Focus ST

- Audi A4



Crossovers/Small SUVs:



\- Seat Ateca: only one I've driven from the list, really liked it, good mix of tech and practicality, fun to drive (I guess)



\- Skoda Karoq: similar to Ateca



\- Mazda CX-5: the one that I can afford (2016-2018) I like the exterior, but the interior seems a bit outdated to me (plus no carplay). The newer ones I love.



\- Honda CRV: only good reviews about them



\- BMW X1: really love these, they seem to have good engines, but am a bit afraid of maintenance costs.

1ndg7uv,"Bought car, suspected gearbox issue within 1st month...","Hello,

I purchased a car on the 15th of August 2025, a ford focus 23 1L ecoboost with 41450 miles, along with Shine! protect and 12 month RAC warranty which actually saved me from spending money on the tow. Didnt have too many issues other than a gut feeling that the car felt off...? 

They did not give me a service history as they said they cannot guarantee it, you would have to see after you purhcase the vehicle and then contact Ford. That should have been my red flag which I ignored as I just wanted to get the car and be done with my car search as it felt fine during the test drive. Bad mistake. 

Car is still under warranty from manufacturer so I decided to get a free visual inspection of the car which reported that everything is essentially green other than one brake pad being slightly more worn than the others but still road worthy.

  
This gave me some peace of mind and trust in the car so I decided to go on a relatively longer trip than I had before which resulted in me breaking down far away from home and calling RAC. The car was making very loud metallic noises the second the clutch hit the biting point in neutral. The technician report stated that they suspected a gearbox issue which rendered the car non-drivable, and would require a tow back to a location of my choosing. I called the dealership and stated what was happening, so they gave me a location to drop the car off. 

After dropping the car off, handing over the one key with me at the time, and taking pictures and videos of the outside and the undercarriage of the car I left for home. The day after I wrote an email clearly stating my right to reject the car under consumer rights act 2015 And that I do not want a repair. They took their time stating they are waiting for a ramp to become available to inspect the car to see whether it is in a rejectable condition and that all the mechanical parts of the car are as was sold (i.e. not replaced by me, which it wasnt). 

  
On Monday the 8th, I got a call asking what I want to do with the car, whether I want to return the car, or get a ford warranty repair, where I stated that I wish to return it. I was then told they have 14 days to inspect the car (??? didnt this start on the 2nd of September when I handed in the car and stating I want to reject it in person?) to see whether it is in a rejectable condition and will then contact me again. 

  
I have not been contacted yet, I asked for an email to be sent to me telling me that they have indeed received my email about my intentions with the car, where they verbally confirmed on the phone that they have recieved it and said they would send the email as a written form of receipt, but they still have not responded. 

  
I spoke to my finance company on the 3rd aswell to keep them in the loop regarding intent, and somehow they lodged the complaint when I was just making sure all grounds were covered regarding my intentions with the car, which made the dealership close up all their correspondence with me as they were now talking to the finance company regarding the car's inspection, who would then contact me, but given current wait times for case handlers that would take up to 8 weeks. I was on the phone for over 6 hours between my dealership and my finance company who were telling me there was no complaint initially, and after multiple calls the complaint was found. Furthermore, they were saying that there was no correspondence between them and the dealership. They were not been even notified about this ""complaint"" that I never filed. I had go to round and round and get as much information as I could by the dealer and they finally found the correspondence which was sent this morning and I closed the complaint (10/09/25). 

  
TLDR: bought a car very rushed, broke down 2 weeks later, got towed back to dealership by RAC, wish to return the car, but getting thrown and feel like dealership is hoping if they take longer i'll cave in and accept the repair. only put \~400 miles on it.

**Questions:**

I am just confused what to do next, I am hoping that the finance company will contact the dealership and tell them that I did not make the complaint as I was told they would.

1: Regarding my rights to reject the car as it is still within one month of purchase, what is the timeframe of which I can excerise my right to reject under Consumer Rights Act 2015, and get a full refund without penalty including the VAPS? (as stated above, I have already sent the email with all the details and specifically stating that I do not want a repair, I just want to reject the car under the consumer rights act.) 

2: What are my chances of getting my money back? 

3: I still have the spare key and the V5C, do I hand those over before receiving any response from them regarding inspection of the car to see whether it is in a rejectable state? or hold onto them until I get word...

4: Should I just get the ford warranty repair that they said is possible?

What I'm reading now (after the garage I took it to this morning mentioned it) is that you probably shouldn't drive it with a misfire as you can do untold amounts of damage to the engine (unburnt fuel can destroy your catalytic converter, fuel wash friction? thrown rods? No idea what those 2 mean)

All in all I've probably driven about 8 miles in limp mode on this guy's advice - does that sound like I might have done some serious damage? Or when people advise that are they taking like ""don't drive it daily for 3 weeks while waiting for a garage appointment""

Currently in the garage and they think the misfire will be fixed by 4x new spark plugs and 1x ignition coil so hopefully all good after that but I'm panicking now that the longevity of the engine will be seriously reduced and whether there's any recourse with the AA giving poor/damaging advice.

12.6v doesn't mean your battery is OK. They can sometimes hold voltage but fuck all charge. But, since it was sudden, I think this is unlikely to have happened. Probably a loose connection has become disturbed or damaged wiring.

I'd start by checking the battery terminals are secure. A shit connection here would be a common culprit. Maybe rub them down with 600 grit.

I'd also check the voltage after 30/15. Poke around in a fusebox and find a low rated fuse (<40 amps) and check the voltage. You may well find you have 12.6v at the battery but substantially less further back (where it's needed). If so then this is clearly a poor connection somewhere."

I own a Honda e over in Iceland, and it has a zero MAM rating for towing, with the manual expressly saying ""Your vehicle is not designed for towing"".

Even after emailing them pictures and showing the options list from Honda, they still refused to cover him.

It's absolutely ridiculous in that instance, but in all honesty you really shouldn't be towing an actual trailer with a zero MAM rated car because your braking system and SRS equipment are not designed to handle the extra weight.  
  
If you do decide to do so, be sure that you're above board with your insurance, as that'll be one of the biggest hurdles.

Desperate_Contact561 (Score: 12): On the Weight plate on the car the first number is the max allowed weight for the car and the second number is the max train weight for the car. the next two numbers are the max front and rear axle weights.

If the train weight is 0 then you are not allowed to tow anything with the car.

The max towing weight is the max train weight minus the max weight.

If you can tow then adding the axle weights together and subtracting them from the Max vehicle weight will give you the max nose weight for the trailer which is usually somewhere between 50 and 100 Kg (this is important for stability when towing).

If you are stopped for a check they will check against the weight plate on the car as this will be correct for your specific car.

1ndeks8,Used Car for New Parents - Help Needed,"Hi Guys, 

My wife and I need some advice on what car to buy ahead of the arrival of our first child in 2 month's time. 

We have just been badly burned by a Used Car Trader (Aylesbury Trade Centre) who misleadingly sold us a used 2012 VW Tiguan with a known oil leak, without disclosing this to us. They tricked us into signing a Trade Sale agreement which waived our rights under the consumer rights act, and any warranty. Because of this, we are now having to sell the car, at a £2k loss (in under 2 months!!!) and start our search again.

We are going to up our budget to £9k - £12k for the replacement vehicle and we're looking for reliability, economy, comfort and space. We're not ""Car People"", but we do care about aesthetics, so want something that looks half decent. 

Google search suggests Nissan Quasqai and Kia Sportage as reliable options at this price. I also like SKODA as a brand - Particularly the Karoq, which seems like a good alternative to the above... I've also seen people have good things to say about the Octavia estate in other threads, but my wife is pretty convinced she wants a small SUV. 

I'd love any advice you all have on what vehicle to go for that delivers on:   
\- £9k - £12k budget  
\- Spacious for buggies and baby stuff  
\- Reliable and affordable to service  
\- Safe

MOT history highlights:

* 2025 (\~77k miles): Clean pass, no advisories (valid until mid-2026).
* 2024 (\~76k): Failed initially (rear brake binding + worn number plate), then passed after fixes.
* 2023 (\~73k): Failed (broken coil spring, worn tyres, damaged mirror, rear brake fluctuation), then passed.
* 2022 (\~67k): Failed (broken coil spring), then passed.
* 2017–2020: Repeated advisories for worn tyres, worn brake discs, and mirror damage — all addressed later.

Other notes:

* 2 owners.
* Only 6 service stamps in the book.
* Garage has good reputation and car looks tidy overall.
* No signs of rust or oil leaks in MOT reports. Gas struts for the boot are a bit rusted on the housing/brackets, but seems surface level.
* I know it's pricier, but I'm a really nervous driver so I need an automatic.

1. Does £7,999 sound fair for this age/mileage/condition?
2. How big a concern is the light service history and the MOT history pattern (repairs seem to have just been done to pass)?
3. Any common long-term issues with 2014 Auto Yaris Hybrids I should keep in mind (e.g. hybrid battery, CVT)?

**Priorities and about me**

* I'm 40, no kids, and work from home. So the mileage of the car will be low - probably around 3000-4000 miles per year at most. 



* Reliability is important - I don't know anything about cars beyond how to drive them. So just want one that works and has no well-known major engine problems like my Focus does 
*  Comfort/Technology - Want heated seats, cruise control, Android auto
* Performance - I don't care that much about speed, but don't want a sluggish car. So maybe 0-60 in the 8-10 second range rather than higher

1. Does this seem a good choice for me then? The Mazda 3 for about £15k at the top end?

Second plan is keep being insured on the Volvo as second driver (cars staying in the family regardless) and get something manual and engaging like a MX5/S2000 and use the Volvo as a daily, bit more expensive but I have little responsibilities at this stage of life

1ndayrr,Mercedes C Class Coupé - Sale issues,"I recently bought a 2018 C300 AMG line with 30k miles on the clock from a dealership (Not Mercedes).

The sale was remote and the car was sold to me as pristine condition, not a mark on the car or alloys. The car has full main dealer service history, apart from this month where the dealership gave it a new MOT and service prior to advertising it.

They done a quick walk around talking through the car and pointing out the features, but the quality of the video wasn’t the greatest and it was done in what looked like an underground storage car park with poor lighting. We also agreed that they would put some fuel in the car to sweeten the deal and that if payment was made that day, they would guarantee delivery for the following day.

Upon receipt of the car, there were numerous issues.

- I paid the dealer for delivery and the car arrived nearly 1.5 days late. Transport company couldn’t get through to dealer so I had to arrange the delivery myself. Dealer reception wouldn’t help, they told me that the sales rep I was dealing with is the only person I can speak with.

- There was a large stone chip on one of the recently refurbed alloys. 

- There were various scratches, some of which by definition are not ‘general wear and tear’. There’s some poorly touched up chips and scuffs from paint pen. One is in the passenger door and the other front bumper.

- The car arrived with less than 4 miles in the tank.

- The paperwork wasn’t sent with the car

- Navigation SD card was missing so I had to buy a new one. When installed to the car, they are one time coded and can’t be used in another. Not sure why this was removed but they said it wasn’t advertised as being in the car. Can’t find the advert anymore so I cut my losses and bought a new one.

I’ve been in negotiation with the dealership to rectify the issues and in the meantime, I was waiting on paperwork to arrive. My V5c arrived yesterday and when I took the car to Mercedes to arrange a service plan, they have absolutely no record of the car ever being in the main dealer. 

I used the V5c number to look at MOT locations and they’ve been done in back street garages, definitely not main dealer. Still waiting on paperwork arriving in the post and I’ve chased this on numerous occasions with the dealership.

Don’t get me wrong, I love the car. Before I found out about the service history, I was nearly happy with the agreement between me and the dealership to rectify the paint work and alloy (I still have to foot some of the bill but they’re paying half). 

What can I do about the service history? Do I return the car and cut my losses on the £500 transport cost and £170 nav SD card, or do I push for a partial refund? I’ve never been in this position before so I’m looking for some advice?

If I return the car and get a full refund, I will be without a car. If I go for partial refund, how much do you think is a good figure to aim for?

1ndaom7,Is it a bad idea to buy a used EV right as the battery warranty is about to end?,"I’ve been looking at second-hand EVs and keep finding some great deals. The catch is that many of them are either close to the 8-year mark or pushing the 100,000-mile limit, so the battery warranty is almost up.

That makes me nervous because I know battery replacements can be ridiculously expensive. At the same time, I’m not too worried about a bit of range loss. If a car started at 250 miles and is now down to 210, that wouldn’t bother me much.

What I can’t decide is whether buying an EV so close to the end of its warranty is asking for trouble, or if I’m overthinking it. On paper, it seems like a smart way to buy after the initial premium has dropped, and some of the prices really are bargains. But maybe they’re cheap because of the risk you’re taking with the battery?

End of the day nothing is perfect or guaranteed. Could be an EV with a bad battery, or an ICE car with a bad engine that fails on you. 

Longer time goes on the more data we’re getting on how well EV batteries hold up over time / mileage. 

Personally I don’t think it’s too much of an issue, and how much of an issue it will be will only become less of an issue as technology progresses. Just depends if you’d want to take the dive now or wait for EVs with more advanced battery tech to fall into your range.

Barph (Score: 9): Depends on the EV, specifically if it is a Nissan Leaf then no it isn't worth it as they had basically no BMS to care for the battery and suffer significant degradation because of it.

Most other EV's will be fine, turns out that the batteries in EV's are easily expected to outlive the cars they are in and really isn't something that you should worry about. 

Another EV to avoid is the earlier Renault Zoe's as their battery has a battery lease which you have to pay monthly which I would stay well away from no matter how cheap the car might get.

1nd9sc3,My very bad experience with Halfords,"I wanted to share my recent experience with Halfords (Edinburgh Seafield) because I feel like I may have been scammed, and hopefully this can warn others.  
Bear in mind that I drive a 2017 Volvo XC90.

* **2nd July 2024**: **Halfords (this was in Kent)** assessed my brakes and said my **rear pads/discs were at 0%** and my **front pads/discs at 70% and 28%**.
* **23rd July 2024 (Edinburgh)**: I had the **rear pads and discs replaced**. (£484.86)
* **1st March 2025 (Edinburgh)**: I had the **front pads and discs replaced**. (£452.73)

Immediately after the March job, the **brakes started squealing**.

When I took the car back on **16th April 2025**, their inspection report showed:

* Rear pads: 56%
* Rear discs: 68%
* Front discs: 92%
* Front pads: 50% (!!)

To me, this makes no sense. How can **front pads be at 50% after only six weeks**? That’s worse than the rear pads, which had been changed almost a year earlier. Even the rear discs were already down to 68% in under a year. It really makes me think they either:

* didn’t actually replace the parts, or
* fitted used/low-quality parts.

On top of this, the brakes have **continued squealing for five months** now.

To make matters worse, when I brought the car in for the April inspection, I dropped it off at 9am and was told it would be ready by the end of the day. They never called me, didn’t answer the phone when I tried to chase and when I went down in person the garage was already closed earlier than it should have been. Because of this, I had to take three Uber rides back and forth. And actually, I’ve had to take multiple Ubers in total just to deal with this saga, all because of their poor workmanship.

So yeah, just a warning: **be very cautious about getting major work done at Halfords**. In my case, the numbers don’t add up, the brakes still squeal and I’ve wasted a ton of time and money because of them.",40,1757497558.0,74,CartalkUK,1757619180,2025-09-10 09:45:58,2025-09-11 19:33:00,"Emotional-Start7994 (Score: 126): Why do people take their car to Halfrauds and then act surprised when they do a terrible job?

1nd666x,"Been hit by a seemingly dodgy taxi, how should I proceed?","My Elgrand was hit on 29th Aug by a Prius taxi driver. Me in left lane going straight over 2 lane roundabout, taxi in right lane, exiting last minute with no indication and hitting the back right of mine with the front left of his. Minor paintwork damage but an inconvenience.
He refused to exchange details, told me to speak to taxi office (Veezu). Veezu claim he doesn't work for them. He also claimed to not have insurance or licence at the scene - not sure eif he meant with him or just  in general.
 My insurance( Quote me Happy) have said he is with Haven Insurance, but I'm not convinced he was the driver on the policy. Haven have bad Google reviews, but my insurance wants £500 excess from me to get repair done which I will then have to claim back from his insurance myself as I don't have legal cover (🙄).
I can't afford to be without £500 for the foreseeable future. Is it best to withdraw my claim via my insurance and go directly to his insurance and claim myself, avoiding my excess? I'm worried it could take months/years to sort out with his shitty company. Any advice welcome.

Such a pain for something that wasn't my fault 😭😭😭",12,1757483431.0,20,CartalkUK,1757619180,2025-09-10 05:50:31,2025-09-11 19:33:00,"ozz9955 (Score: 17): This all sounds a bit backwards. Your insurance processes the claim, and then claims off the other party's insurance. Nothing to do with legal cover, and you certainly don't need it to claim on insurance. Who are you insured through?

1nczqnh,CUE Database Query,"My car was involved in a hit-and-run in May 2025 while parked outside my house. I notified my insurer and decided to claim directly from the third party’s insurer, as I had irrefutable CCTV footage of the incident. As they accepted full liability, they handled everything, so I didn’t lose my NCB or pay any excess.

With my renewal due in October, I submitted a Subject Access Request to the MIB to review my record. To my surprise, they came back today saying they couldn’t find anything in the database regarding claims or accidents under my name.

Is it normal for a third party non-fault claim like this not to appear on the CUE?",3,1757463652.0,3,CartalkUK,1757619180,2025-09-10 00:20:52,2025-09-11 19:33:00,"Man_in_the_uk (Score: 1): Not all companies use the CUE as it's a service that costs money.

Traditional-Swan-130 (Score: -1): CUE only logs claims that go through your own insurer or where they’ve had to pay out. Since you went straight to the other side’s insurer, it doesn’t touch your record. Insurers will still usually ask if you’ve been in any accidents though, even non-fault ones, so you need to declare it at renewal even if it doesn’t show on CUE"
