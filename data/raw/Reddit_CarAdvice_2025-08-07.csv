1mjks1g,2010 cube help,"I bought a 2010 Nissan cube 88k mi for my daughter for her first car. Minor clicking in the front hubs. Everything else was great. Power, engine sounded perfect. A month later, two blocks from home the gas pedal would do nothing. Engine would not rev rpms only getting to 1400. Then would eventually rev up and go. I checked it out. You start it revs fine. Then it would not rev when you hold the gas down or gradually press it. Intermittently it would start to rev and slowly rev very high. It doesn‚Äôt seem like it is starved for fuel ( fuel pump, filter, clogged maf ) it‚Äôs almost like it goes into limp mode but will end up revving up fine a few mins later without turning off the car. 
Any ideas would be helpful

This has occurred 3 times over a year with the most recent fix being in May this year 3 months ago, I've done some simple research and narrowed it down to either: faulty blend door, or faulty blend door actuators.

The driver side only has a problem where it will simply stop blowing cool air at all and in the 100 degree heat it's unacceptable

What else should I check, I only have an obd reader and a little thing to check fuses.  
How do I test these easily? Could I replace a broken blend door myself?

\[EDIT\] So I've checked the actuators and they seem to work, are the actuators adjustable? I'm not sure they're closing the door fully.

The door isn't broken either, fiddling with it it seems to work, I can feel the weight of the door on the little plastic piece. BUT I did notice the metal near it was extremely hot immediately. as soon as the AC and engine are turned on.

Can you hear the fuel pump run before starting? I think it‚Äôs also common for inertia switch issues as well as neutral safety switch issues on these trucks.

To make the magic happen, you need fuel, air, and spark. For the time being, we‚Äôll assume you have air. 

If you don't hear any popping or sputtering, you're missing spark, fuel, or a rare combination of both.  

I‚Äôm unfamiliar with this engine, but there should be a port somewhere to connect a fuel pressure gauge.  Some look like a valve for a car tire. You can easily push in the valve to see if there‚Äôs pressure.

Spark is a little tougher to check since you‚Äôll need someone to help crank the engine while you are looking for the spark. 

There are devices that you can lay on the plug wires to see if you have spark. You can disconnect one of the plug wires from a spark plug and use a screwdriver to see if you have spark. Or if you have a spare spark plug, you can insert it into the plug wire boot and place it against the engine block to see if you get a spark.

1mjhjnb,Auxiliary belt squeaking Renault Clio,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm currently working on a 2004 Renault Clio 2 with a 4DF 1.2 petrol engine. The car has a squeaking V-belt, and I‚Äôm trying to figure out the cause. A few thousand kilometers ago, both belts were replaced ‚Äî one for the alternator and the other for the air conditioning compressor.

Troubleshooting:
	‚Ä¢	The alternator belt was not properly tensioned. I removed it, inspected the belt (it looks like new), checked for play on the alternator pulley (no play, spins smoothly), and refitted the belt correctly on the ribs of the pulleys. I tensioned it properly and used the Gates Carbon Drive app (an app that measures the frequency of the sound from the belt when you pluck it like a guitar string) to measure the frequency. According to factory specs, it should be 210 Hz. I can only get up to 170 Hz, but it was 60 Hz before I tightened it. I‚Äôm afraid that if I push the alternator further to tension the belt, I might break something. So the belt is nice and tight. My method might not be the most accurate.

However, it‚Äôs still squeaking. I suspect the bearing in the crankshaft pulley. I also notice it wobbling quite a bit when it spins. But to remove it, I first need to loosen the outer Torx bolt of the pulley and then turn the M20 (?) hex clockwise to be able to remove the belt.

As always with these things, my ratchet with the Torx bit doesn‚Äôt fit in the space, so we haven‚Äôt been able to remove the belt yet to check for play on the pulley.

I‚Äôm Living Out of My QX4 in Oakland ‚Äî Car Won‚Äôt Start After Theft Attempt, No Key, Immobilizer Locked, I‚Äôm Desperate


Hey y‚Äôall,
I‚Äôm in a real f***ed up situation and I‚Äôm begging for help from anyone who knows Nissans, immobilizers, or how to bypass this kind of thing.

I live in Oakland, CA, and I‚Äôm living out of my 1999 Infiniti QX4. A while back, someone tried to steal my ride, and during the attempt they ripped out the immobilizer antenna ring. That kicked off this whole nightmare. The ignition cylinder also got messed up, and now I‚Äôm completely locked out from starting the car.

I have no working key.
I have no crank.
No spark.
No fuel.
NATS2 is locked up hard.
And the car is at serious risk of being towed any day now.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done so far:
	‚Ä¢	Went to Pick-n-Pull and grabbed a matching ECU + immobilizer ring from a donor QX4
	‚Ä¢	Got the correct 8-pin connector and matching color wires, ready to splice
	‚Ä¢	I had an Autel KM100X tool and tried to program a new key, but I no longer have access to the tool
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôve been chasing wires, trying to trace things back, even considering removing the NATS chip from the ECU
	‚Ä¢	I have 3 ECUs and immobilizer boxes, but they‚Äôre mixed up and I don‚Äôt know which pair goes together

I‚Äôm not trying to steal anything. This is my vehicle, my shelter, and my home. I just need to get it running long enough to move it to safety before I lose everything I still have.

Please ‚Äî does anyone know:
	1.	How to bypass the NATS2 system (even temporarily)?
	2.	How to match a junkyard ECU + IMMO box without a key?
	3.	Can I just splice the correct wires to install the antenna ring and trigger unlock mode?
	4.	Is it possible to program a universal key/transponder chip without the original, now that I have the right ECU + IMMO pair?
	5.	Any shops in the Bay Area / Oakland that‚Äôll unlock or flash ECUs without charging dealership prices?
	6.	Is that method of removing the NATS chip from the ECU legit?

I‚Äôm out here trying to figure this all out on my own. I‚Äôve got tools, parts, solder, and patience ‚Äî but I need help from someone who knows how this system works inside and out. I‚Äôm down bad. And time‚Äôs running out.

Any help, advice, wiring diagrams, or even a direction to look would mean everything right now.

Thank you.

As for what I'd do:

Immobilizer rings aren't often ECU locked. The ECU usually does the actual key registry stuff. So put your original ECU in, and install the immobilizer ring. 

To remove the ignition cylinder, you're gonna have to drill next to two roll pins and pry them out, then the cylinder will come out. Usually clocked in super awkward places. You may need a right angle drill. 

Buy a new cylinder, bring your reg, insurance and ID to local locksmith. Ask them to ""pull a Nissan code from NASTF please"" and rekey your ignition and cut you two keys with a TI-4D60 or NIO2 type keys. Install the ignition, get a scan tool (don't use an Autel, you'd need a Topdon or Londsor or something probably) and it'll walk you through reregistering keys. 

Or, just call a competent locksmith, and pay them to fix it. Mechanics can't help you. You need a man with a van and a locksmith license and a non-Autel immo tool."

1mjgeds,Shaking on highway and pulls to the left (after alignment+balance),"Do I need a new set of wheels?

Hey y'all, my car is a 2016 Lexus CT 200h F Sport.

It had a bent wheel since I bought the car. Very small bend, which I had fixed at a wheel repair shop a month ago (photo post-fix attached). After fixing it, the annoying bumpy sound went away and I no longer had vibrations when on the highway. However, I knew I had to get it balanced.

I went yesterday to Firestone and got the ALIGNMENT + ROTATION + BALANCE taken care of. I picked up the car and drove only a few minutes home so I didn't notice anything. This morning though, I left to work and it felt weird. I got on the highway and the car shakes, like pretty uncomfortably and annoyingly bad. The car feels planted and I am in control, but man is it uncomfortable. I have attached a video so you can kind of see the liquid in the cup and the cup itself shaking, but it doesn't reflect the full strength of the shaking.

The car also now pulls a lot to the left. To the point that I not only have to have my hand on the wheel at all times, but I also need to basically hold it with slight force to the right, otherwise it wants to go left.

Anyone knows what it could be? I am taking it back to them Friday (no earlier appointments available) but I just wanted to pick y'all's brains. I am thinking maybe I'll need to get a full new set of wheels? I would hope not but I'll do it if that's what will fix the issue. 

Thanks for your input!

TLDR; Had bent wheel, got it fixed at shop, drove for a month with only slight vibration and pull to the left which I assumed was due to needing balance. Got balance + alignment + rotation yesterday at Firestone and now the car pulls way stronger to the left and shakes a lot on the highway. Any ideas? Do I need full new set of wheels?

1mjfq39,2017 Hyundai Tuscon - ECO/Sport Mode Causes Transmission Issues?,"I'll try to keep it short and simple. In 2021 we bought a '17 Tucson. The first week we had it we had a trip scheduled from Wichita, KS to Fairplay, CO.

Drove it around on the long and straight road and along the way noticed that there was a Drive Mode button. Started playing around with the ECO on the highway to see if the mpg improved.

Once we got out to the mountains/hills of Denver I started playing around with Sport mode.

I don't speed, I don't drive like a maniac, etc. I am especially cautious driving in the mountains just to make sure I don't jack anything up.

However, the transmission effectively went out on us. The actual work done doesn't appear to be on the CARFAX. It started sputtering and didn't want to go anywhere. Had to have it towed back home.

A few months later, we had to have similar work done. CARFAX says that Ignition Coils were replaced, engine/powertrain work was completed.

From that point on, we just ignored the ECO/Sport button because we forgot that it existed.

Queue another trip to the Ozarks in 2023. Same story, re-discovered the ECO/Sport button, started playing around with it on the road trip and it led to the same thing. Ignition Coils, engine/powertrain/transmission work, etc.

Get the car back, swear to never press the button again.

2 years later, toddler starts getting older and loves to sit in the driver's seat and push buttons while we are waiting to go inside a store, etc. She must have pushed the ECO/Sport button and we drove around in ECO mode for who knows how long before we noticed it.

Turned off ECO mode and now we feel like the car is starting to sputter and have trouble shifting driving. We are having it checked out again this weekend...

**BUT, tll;dr:** 17 Tucson always seems to crash out when Drive Mode button is used to switch between ECO/Sport/Normal. Can't find anyone else having this issue.

1mjdlw9,Rythmic Thumping in Left Front Wheel,"https://reddit.com/link/1mjdlw9/video/m7u0ftbp6ghf1/player

Hey guys, amateur car guy here! I've got a 2010 Ford Fusion Hybrid 2.5l gas/electric motor with about 141k miles on it and recently it's been making a weird noise in the left front wheel. You can hear it pretty well in the video I attached, but seriously the best way I can describe it, and you'll have to excuse my dub step here, is a ""wub wub wub"" noise. It sounds the most like that when you're accelerating from a stop. It gets faster and more intense in direct correlation to the speed you're going and it gets worse when you turn, especially to the left. The noise also translates to a vibration at the same frequency that you can feel in the steering wheel. It might also be happening in the right wheel, but it's the most noticeable on the driver's side.

My first thought is that it was a bad wheel bearing because I used to have a 2010 Ford Fusion Sport and it had a bad wheel bearing that caused almost the exact same vibration in the steering wheel when turning. However, I jacked it up to test for play in the wheel and it didn't have any. I was unable to replicate the noise while it was jacked up and I tried spinning the wheel.

The mechanic said they checked for a bad wheel bearing and couldn't find any signs of one so I guess it must not be that. They initially told me that the vibration and noise was caused by tar that got stock on my car's front two rubber rings on the wheels (the algorithm won't let me say the t-word in this subreddit apparently) but I got new ones put on after taking it in and the sound persists. They also suggested that I do a front rotor and brake pad replacement, but I've never known a bad rotor or brake pad to cause a sound like this. The noise happens whether I'm braking or not and braking feels completely normal with no vibration or wiggling in the steering wheel when I brake. Could this really be what it is? If it is I'll just do the replacement myself cause I don't want to pay them the $350 they quoted me for the job.

I‚Äôm not trying to steal anything. This is my vehicle, my shelter, and my home. I just need to get it running long enough to move it to safety before I lose everything I still have.

Please ‚Äî does anyone know:
	1.	How to bypass the NATS2 system (even temporarily)?
	2.	How to match a junkyard ECU + IMMO box without a key?
	3.	Can I just splice the correct wires to install the antenna ring and trigger unlock mode?
	4.	Is it possible to program a universal key/transponder chip without the original, now that I have the right ECU + IMMO pair?
	5.	Any shops in the Bay Area / Oakland that‚Äôll unlock or flash ECUs without charging dealership prices?
	6.	Is that method of removing the NATS chip from the ECU legit?

I‚Äôm out here trying to figure this all out on my own. I‚Äôve got tools, parts, solder, and patience ‚Äî but I need help from someone who knows how this system works inside and out. I‚Äôm down bad. And time‚Äôs running out.

Any help, advice, wiring diagrams, or even a direction to look would mean everything right now.

You'll never get the same beam pattern and you'll potentially glare oncoming drivers. Don't be that guy.

In general terms, the thinner the LED bulb ""post"" and the smaller the chips (provided they're located exactly where an incandescent filament is), the better the pattern will be, but there will always be issues with light distribution as you can't make the post that holds the chips infinitely thin. The most common is having two dark spots right above and under the directional chips which translates into dark areas/dead spots in your beam pattern.

Remove those LEDs, put the original bulbs back in. Restore your headlights if they're hazy, or do a projector retrofit which is the right way to upgrade your lights.

The owners manual has instructions on how to program a new key considering you have the original key to the car. 

His original key was broken but when placed right by the ignition cylinder, the immobilized would read and start the car.

Did you get that quote from the Caddy dealer?

There are several less expensive options:

1.  Some Autozones, ans other parts stores can sell and program a key, as long as you have a good one to copy. Most are under $200 complete.

2. Several sites on the web sell chip key blanks with instructions to program yourself. Then take it anywhere rhat can cut the key. Under $100 complete.

anonposting987 (Score: 1): Every answer here so far is wrong.  A 1999 Cadillac probably had VATS which was a resistor in the actual key itself.  Each key had a unique resistance that the vehicle read, and if it didn't match what was expected, it would not engage the fuel pump.  

OP Google GM VATS and see if your old key looked like the images you get and please report back.  They were pretty distinctive. There were only about 20 different resistance values, so it was not very secure, but more secure than no VATS

I used to work at a car stereo shop back in the early 2000's where I installed remote starters, which were basically a fancy way to hotwire your car.  I could bypass these with a simple relay and a resistor.

The next key based security for GM was called PK2 and had the resistor based in the ignition cylinder so it prevented hot wiring.  These needed no special keys.  

GM didn't start using transponders until something around 2003?  

$500 seems expensive for what you have.  I'd look for a second quote

Edit: Also I believe you can program these yourself if you buy a VATS key online, but you still have to have it physically cut by a locksmith and with no original key to copy that is still probably expensive.

Edit to an edit:  if you find a shady car stereo shop that has some old dudes that were doing this in the early 2000's like me, they can probably permanently disable this system so all you need is a basic key."

His father taught him how to work on cars and despite trying to enter other professions, he ultimately always returned to car work and now owns his business in the SF bay area. He's been at his own shop for the last maybe 10-15 years. I am his eldest child and I feel like I have always expressed a genuine interest in auto work. When I was little living in Mex and he fixed microbuses I would be there watching and handing him tools. As I got older tho, my mom and dad didn't think it was safe for me to be around the shop a lot and never thought auto work would be a genuine career path. Perhaps because I'm a woman and mostly because they wanted me to get an ""education"" and a ""real career"" where I ""didn't have to work so much."" I think what they meant was getting a desk job or a job where I was ""paid to think"" and to ""follow my dreams."" Unfortunately, my dreams were to become a journalist/reporter and in the prime year of 2025 news media is dying and seasoned reporters are fighting over what are supposed to be entry level jobs. I'm trying to break into that industry but it is so grueling and ruthless and I simply cannot compete with ppl who have 5-7 years of experience over me. No matter how much I sell myself I always fall short.

In the summer of 2022 (I was 19) I worked briefly with my dad and he taught me how to do oil changes, install new brakes, install a new timing chain/belt, install spark plugs and other basic stuff. I will admit my back was SHREDDED within the first week and the first day I worked with him I slept for 15 hours upon coming home. I only worked for like three weeks before getting an internship at a university doing comms for alumni relations which I hated but for the sake of experience I did it.

My father has a successful business, but he is nearing retirement age and I can tell he is on the down trend in term of his physical capacities. Id give him 10-15 more years tops. I obviously don't want to imagine what we're gonna do with all his tools when he passes, but I just feel like it would be a huge missed opportunity to create generational wealth through the garage before he passes. I have a pretty useless degree in journalism, and following my dreams kinda left me in an equally shitty position if I just hadn't gone to college. My current job, which has no degree requirements, is in admin and I'm technically an ""intern"" making 27 an hour with ZERO benefits. I have a hard time even getting jobs without a degree requirement. I don't think im dumb i just think the job market is fucked and I'm young/ ""inexperienced"" So really wtf am I doing?

Should I just commit to my father and work under him and learn as much as I can and make the business my own when my dad steps down? How risky do you guys think this is? Will this backfire like my other career choices? Will it be harder for me to retain clientele because I am a woman?

TLDR: My (22F) dad (50M) is a 35+ years experienced mechanic. I have a degree in liberal arts. My degree isn't helping me get a good job where I dont have to ""labor"" as hard which is what father wanted. I've always expressed interest in auto work. Should I become an apprentice under my father for however long he has remaining in him and take over the business when he retires?

24 y/o female from Pennsylvania here. It‚Äôs that time of the year for me to take my old sh*tbox to the car doctor for an inspection, and I‚Äôm terrified. 

A little history about my car: it‚Äôs a 2011 Nissan Juke SL AWD (I know, one of those ugly compact SUVs. I thought it was cute at the time, please don‚Äôt judge me), 4 cylinder, automatic. Ever since I brought it home, the SES lights up the dash and has been an absolute eyesore for years.

At this point, I‚Äôve given up and sometimes I put a piece of electrical tape over it because I‚Äôm so done with it.

What all does a PA inspection consist of? I‚Äôve read that a SES light is an automatic fail, but my old mechanic knew about it and would pass my inspections (I have a new mechanic now. I‚Äôm afraid they may fail me even if I tell them the history of this thing.) I‚Äôm scared they may find something wrong with my car that‚Äôll cost more than what I can afford. It‚Äôs the only car I have. I absolutely cannot afford a new one. 

Maybe someone can help me calm my nerves? I‚Äôm frantic and all over the place about getting this inspection done.

1misn7z,Valvoline Top Off Seized Engine,"I drive a 2008 Mazda three with 225K miles on it. I know that‚Äôs a lot and I know that my car is oil so I always make sure to top it off once or twice before my next oil change. I was due for an oil change at 226500 miles and I went to top it off during my lunch break and planned to get a full oil change later in the week when I got paid. The guy who was changing my oil was definitely new because I had never seen him there before, and he was very nervous and kept asking questions about how much oil should be put in the car to which the guy responded until it‚Äôs full. My AC also cut out which was charged three weeks prior so they recharge my AC as part of a warranty. I work two minutes from the shop so I went back to work and park my car and on the way home from work about 5 miles from my exit my car started to make a ticking sound. The highway that I drive has no shoulder so I really just wanted to make it off of my exit so I eased up on the gas to try and coast to the exit. Going up the hill to get to my exit. The sound was so loud and my car literally shut off and the momentum was able to get me off of the exit and I was able to pull over. I had to pay $120 to get my car towed from where it stopped to my house which was not even a minute away. That‚Äôs besides the point. My car would not start and there was  smoke  coming from under the hood. My car never showed that it was running hot and they topped my oil off with 3 quarts. Usually at a Valvoline, they will check your lights and all of your other fluids just to make sure because they‚Äôre always trying to upsell you. That didn‚Äôt happen this time. I checked my dipstick and not only was it not locked into place. It was just sitting in spot. There was a coolant leak, and the dipstick showed that the oil level was very low as if there was no oil in there and I took a picture of it. So not even 30 miles later and my engine seized up.

I went to Valvoline this morning, this happened yesterday, and they sent a mechanic from their company to my house to assess the damage. I recorded all of our conversations, but long story short he basically tried to say that it was my fuel pump or a spark plug or maybe my gasket blue. My coolant was very low and it had sprayed and leaked all over the under body. There was no oil leaks, and when he checked the dipstick, the oil was black and showing that it was full. I told him regardless of what he thinks is the issue‚Ä¶ My car was running fine. I got it topped off and now all of a sudden I have no coolant, and my oil is black. They didn‚Äôt even tell me that my oil was so black that I should get it changed. Also on the receipt it shows that they didn‚Äôt check any of my fluids. So I‚Äôm trying to file a claim of negligence and they are saying that I have to tow my car at my own expense to a mechanic And pay for them to do a diagnosis, but I feel like this shouldn‚Äôt be my responsibility. I have no money to afford a tow let alone a diagnosis fee out-of-pocket‚Ä¶ For eight maybe they will cover it. Has anyone experienced this and how can I be more aggressive in getting them to pay For a car damage? I literally have no car which means if I can‚Äôt get to work I‚Äôm going to lose my job and I really feel like this is their fault. I think 3 quarts was way too much for a top off when my car only holds 4 quarts. And I think it‚Äôs very weird that there is no coolant at all in my car. I feel like that guy did not know what he was doing and instead of getting a second opinion, he just did what he thought was right and he fucked up my car and now it won‚Äôt start.",0,1754446797.0,19,mechanic,1754595467,2025-08-06 02:19:57,2025-08-07 19:37:47,"Wild_Ad4599 (Score: 6): So you know your car is burning oil? 

You go in for a top off and new guy is kind of like WTF how much oil do I need to add, because 3 quarts is a lot obviously, so he double-checks that he should keep adding oil. He does so until it‚Äôs full. 

You drive home and hear a ticking sound, which must be fairly loud to be heard on the freeway. Understandably but stupidly you continue to drive like that for 5 miles while it gets louder and then dies when you exit. 

I mean even if you did pull over immediately your engine was likely done at that point anyway, so it doesn‚Äôt matter. 

It also doesn‚Äôt matter that Valvoline topped off your oil for you and didn‚Äôt check your fluids. Your car has been on borrowed time for a while now and you‚Äôve been driving 3qts low as well. It‚Äôs a Mazda with 225k miles. 

This is what happened, your engine had a failure, rod, valve, piston, something failed and started making the sound you heard, this built up heat and friction and cracked the block or something else in the cooling system blew and you started losing fluid, the temp gauge doesn‚Äôt work right in that situation. 

Your car died. It‚Äôs not Valvoline‚Äôs fault. 

Learn how to top off and check your own fluids for the future tho. Check your oil once a week at minimum.

2.	‚Å†‚Å†Park the car on level ground and shut the engine off. Wait 2-3 mins.
3.	‚Å†‚Å†Remove dipstick, wipe clean with a clean cloth or paper towel. Pay no attention to the level at this point.
4.	‚Å†Reinsert dipstick fully into the tube, ensuring it‚Äôs fully seated.
5.	‚Å†Remove dipstick and hold level/horizontal/parallel to the ground. Observe reading.  The oil reading should be where the oil shows around the entire dipstick, not just a thin strip. The thin strip is not a valid reading and has no impact.

If reading is above the halfway point of the two dots, take no action. If reading approaches the lower dot, add approx 0.5 quart of oil. Distance between the two dots is approx 1.0 quarts. If reading is below the lower dot, add 1.0 quarts and recheck after 2-3 mins.

If the dipstick is particularly difficult to read, you can add a bit of texture to the reading area by scuffing it with sandpaper or other light abrasion. Ensure you wipe any abrasion clean before reinserting."

1mj976h,"Help! Newbie trying a replay attack on my car keyfobs, but URH and CC1101 are giving me trouble","Hey everyone, I'm new to this whole SDR and RF thing, and I'm trying to do a simple replay attack on my cars. I only have an RTL-SDR for capturing, so I built a tool to transmit the signals I capture using a CC1101 RF module and an ESP8266. I followed[ this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPVckkTjsd0) for guidance, but I'm completely lost on what the guy is calculating in the video.

I have two cars, and after analyzing their keyfobs with SDR++, I found that one uses FSK modulation and the other uses ASK.

The ASK signal works mostly fine. When I capture it with Universal Radio Hacker (URH), it decodes the signal and I can see the preamble and the actual data. However, when I re-transmit it using my CC1101 tool and recapture it with the RTL-SDR, the ""pause"" values are different from the original signal.

The FSK signal is where I'm really stuck. I entered the center frequency and captured the signal, but I can't see the preamble or the decoded data like I did with the ASK signal.

My main questions are:

How do you properly capture FSK signals using URH?

What exactly is the ""pause"" value in URH?

Is it even possible to accurately re-send a captured signal using the CC1101 tool I built?

What is he calculating in the video I linked?

1mj8kut,Need advice for an anti lag device for cars with Manual transmission,"I've been working on this device that tries to give you pops / burbles by cutting the spark entirely during deceleration. Its basically just a relay / switch that's placed in between the ignition coil and the sparkplug and during deceleration I manually press a button to cut the spark while keeping the accelerator pedal pressed - this way I get unburnt fuel going into the exhaust. This was going well until I realised that as soon as the ECU detects that the sparkplug is disconnected, it also stops injecting fuel. So for now I've put this idea aside but have come up with a different plan using the same device with some tweaks - An Antilag device to reduce turbo lag during upshifts.

  
The theory :  
Tweak the device a little bit to integrate it with the OBD2 port so it can receive live data such as accelerator pedal position, rpm etc.

When it detects clutch fully pressed and accelerator fully pressed and rpm > some threshold - Cut spark. Then when the clutch is released again, resume spark. This way I can keep the turbo spinning. I know this will throw a DTC but that's ok as long as it doesn't go to limp mode.

If you cut spark, how do expect the turbo to stay spooled with no combustion?

Anti lag works by retarding timing, injecting more fuel, or using a bypass valve (rally style) to keep the turbo spooled. There is still some form of combustion to keep the turbo spinning

1mjken1,Am I Eligible for a Tire Warranty at Costco? Tires Worn Out Before 30K Miles,"
Hey everyone,
I need some help or advice regarding Costco's tire warranty.

I got a set of tires from Costco in **February 2023**, and I was told they came with a **5-year or 80,000-mile warranty**. I‚Äôve only put about **30,000 miles** on them, and today when I went in to get them rotated, the technician told me they‚Äôre basically bald and can‚Äôt be rotated. They said I need **new tires** already.

That seems way too fast for them to wear out, especially with regular driving. When I asked about the warranty, the employee didn‚Äôt mention anything and kind of implied it might be a mechanical issue (which felt like a way to dodge the warranty talk). But my alignment and suspension are fine as far as I know, and I‚Äôve kept up with regular maintenance.

Has anyone been in a similar situation?
Can I still file a claim through Costco for tire replacement under warranty even if the tread wore out faster than expected?
And if so, do I go through the warehouse or should I reach out to corporate directly?

Any advice would be appreciated. I just want to make sure I‚Äôm not getting brushed off when these tires should‚Äôve lasted much longer.

Since it happened pretty uneventfully at idle, there's a *chance* that the timing broke and shut her down before destroying the engine.... but yeaaa, typically in an interference engine, if the timing fully breaks like that there's likely to be some amount of unwanted internal contact that's happened between parts.¬†

Sludge can be caused by a variety of factors. High quality oil is formulated to suspend material without losing its ability to flow. Low grade oil may not handle it so well and turn to a pudding like substance that eventually solidifies (cooks) if it collects in high heat areas like on top of the cylinder head. If the maintenance history shows timely oil changes, then the quality of the oil used could be questioned.

The sludge shown is not bothering anything.  Trying to remove it may result in the debris clogging the oil pump pickup or oil passages if not handled correctly.

They tell me it's a transmission issue and they'll put in a new transmission control module, which will take a couple days and about $1500, and I agree.  

A few days later, they call me to tell me that it's still having issues after the replacement, and that to fully fix it will cost another couple thousand, which at this point would mean the car is basically totaled.  They tell me there's a recall for transmissions for this car and to check with a dealership who might do the work for free.  The dealership I spoke to explained that it's past the date where that's a free option (I feel like the mechanic should have known this).  Sucks, but oh well.

The mechanic says they'll undo the $1500 repair and only charge me for the diagnosis ($130).  They also tell me that one of their mechanics has offered to buy it off me as is for $600.  This offer is suspicious to me, and I'll break down my reasons:

* The person telling me it's broken and expensive to fix is apparently the same person telling me they want it.  Why would they want it?  Just to sell to a junkyard?  Why offer to be the middleman for that?
* They know I'm from out of town and it's very inconvenient for me to come back and check their work or do my own test drive.
* They likely can guess I'm not much a car person by the fact that I didn't know to take advantage of the recall.  I'll admit I am an ideal victim.
* The fact that they're offering to undo the $1500 fix seems exactly like the type of thing that would happen in a con where a conman would trick you into thinking they're being very generous in order to put you in a wallet-opening mood.
* When it broke down, the local tow truck driver said something along the lines of ""You want me to take it *there*?  Okay...""  (I was in the middle of a long trip and hoped to be back on the road quickly if it was an easy fix, so I took it to whoever said they had availability)

All that said, it's also plausible to me that everything is actually perfectly above board and one of their mechanics is just hoping to make a couple hundred bucks scrapping it themselves or something.

Let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs a 10 hour job at $200 an hour. That‚Äôs 2 grand just in labor, let alone the cost of a new transmission. If he‚Äôs doing the work himself he won‚Äôt have to pay that. Could be that he‚Äôs got the same car as you at home with a busted engine and a hood transmission. This happens a lot, and a lot of mechanics think they‚Äôre helping out when they offer to buy your car off you. My daily driver is an old piece of shit and I keep it cause it costs me very little to fix my own car. Also they don‚Äôt want it to sell it to a junkyard. They would get about/less than 600 for it.

‚ÄúThey know I‚Äôm out of town.‚Äù This is basically an irrelevant coincidence.

‚ÄúThey know I‚Äôm a likely victim due to not taking advantage of the warranty.‚Äù Lots of people don‚Äôt take advantage of the warranty. You are not unique in that regard. Lots of mechanics forget to check the recall status of their own vehicles. Car makers don‚Äôt exactly want to advertise these kinds of things because they have to do a whole bunch of work for free.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre offering to undo the $1500 fix‚Äù this is because the TCM is usually a very simple repair where most of the cost is in the part itself and not the labor. Most computers run at least a thousand bucks. They‚Äôre offering to undo it because they didn‚Äôt diagnose the issue properly and put a computer in it thinking it would fix the issue. They can easily recoup the cost by returning the computer and they‚Äôre not missing a ton of labor. This is the shop doing you a solid for making a mistake in the diag process. 

‚ÄúTow truck driver interaction.‚Äù Not to be rude but tow truck drivers are often morons. 

So to conclude, your car sounds like it has a bad transmission. Somebody misdiagnosed the computer, it did not fix the issue. They wanted to cover their butts and not ruin their reputation so they undo the repair since they can easily do so. They offer to buy the car from you since a new transmission and the labor to install it is probably worth more than you‚Äôre willing to pay. They can either drive the car as a personal vehicle, use it as a shop loaner vehicle, or sell it after dropping a new transmission in it.

In the previous post, I had fiddled with the rear sway bar link, causing it to detach. I taped it down to other components during the video. The noise began before the link fully failed (and I broke it with a light tug while investigating). After that post, I replaced the links with Moogs.

Now, a similar noise still exists, although it is more similar to a ‚Äúratcheting‚Äù noise. It occurs seemingly at random, and is not exacerbated by heavy turns. It seems to still be coming from the rear right, where this video was filmed. In this video, the car is going 25 or so down a straight, vaguely (like 3/10) bumpy road.

Points in favor of it still being the rear sway bar link is that the noise still exists after replacing the links, but is now less common and sounds different. The rear bushings do not appear to have any give. Noise sounds similar to¬†[this sound from Youtube:](https://youtu.be/0S8JBe_jn6g?si=WlQrr_fpNjud7mUc&t=31)

Other suspicious components (arranged in order of suspicion):

* Front sway bar bushings are cracked and need replacement. Feels less unstable than rear was, though. Is it possible that fixing the rear could have exacerbated problems with the front, or does that make no sense?
* Rear brake rotors and pads need replacing. Probably causing the underlying rubbing noise in some capacity. Front rotors may need replacing as well.
* Rear control arm bushings are starting to loosen
* Front left and rear right cv axles have a¬†*small*¬†amount of up-and-down give, but no sign of leakage. Front right cv axle inner joint looks a¬†[little deformed,](https://imgchest.com/p/6eyrlgeokyp)¬†but has no give.

It‚Äôs not that the mechanic didn‚Äôt find a leak but it‚Äôs more like you mentioned that you got an oil change recently, they saw some spilled oil, assumed it was that and cleaned it up, but didn‚Äôt really have the time to sit there and watch it for a long period and you needed your car so they gave it back to you. If you still notice oil that seems to be leaking then that means you might indeed have a leak or whenever it was spilled from the oil change might be pooled into a crevasse somewhere and slowly dripping. 

Best thing to do is take it back to a mechanic and tell them you believe there might be a leak, you‚Äôre not sure, and to leave it with them and make arrangements so they can hold onto it for a day or two and really monitor the leak actively to trace the origin of it."

However, oil is cheap compared to engine damages so feel free to do it earlier.   OEMs use many different algorithms.   There are factors other than mileage that goes into the calculations, such as cold starts, temperature readings, and the distance the pistons have slid, which is a much better indicator than most.   Almost all engines are within 10% of the same value, if you measure piston distance.  RPM is also considered as force increases wear, when multiplied by calculated torque, i.e, horsepower.  

And then there are the oil weights and types.

\------------------------------------

Hey all,  
  
I'm sure this question gets asked here every other day, so thanks for taking the time to read.

For the past couple years, my transmission has been shifting pretty hard when it reaches high operating temperature. Occurs most often during the summer, but almost always when I am driving in heavy city or highway traffic (stop & go). The issue will temporarily resolve itself when I leave the car for an hour or more to cool down. The previous owner kept a list of various tune-ups, oil changes, and mechanic trips---however, I did not see anything about transmission fluid replacement. If it hasn't been replaced, don't bother (or so I've been told). I also experience a slight knock from the transmission when braking harder than normal. Of course, this is easier to avoid than traffic, but I figured I'd bring it up. 

I've called around to price gauge diagnosis and labor rates. Two mechanics mentioned transmission pressure, with one specifically identifying it as a possible minor slip in the torque converter. When the temperature gets high enough, the computer code trips and causes the line pressure to max out. Another mechanic mentioned possible worn-out shift solenoids.

As long as I don't push the transmission too hard (hard acceleration/deceleration), I can almost always avoid this hard shifting.

I am well aware that the engines in these cars are very reliable, and so far that has been the case, as far as I'm away (besides an oil leak that needs to be addressed). The transmissions, however, leave much to be desired. I've read that they could require a rebuild/replacement around 150,000 miles.

**Additional Issues** (possibly related issues?)  
\- I've noticed relatively recently that starting up the car will result in a very hard start. It doesn't happen every time. Maybe about about 5 out of every 10 turn-overs.  
\- In the last 4 years of owning this car, it has stalled on me 4 - 5 times. Once while vehicle was in motion (40mph).

Thank you all for taking time to read this post and hopefully offering advice for me. I really want to keep the car, as the other issues with it are extremely minor. I don't think I need to warrant getting a completely different car with possible unknown issues. Also, if you were in my position, what might be a reasonable price for diagnosis?

1mitzzi,"Low oil, put in 5w-40 instead of 5w-20 - Dashlight unresponsive??","I just got my first car about 3 months ago- a 2008 Honda Element, 175k miles, bought from a dealership.

A month or so into getting the car, I got a dash light on that said I had 15% oil. I was a bit confused since I just got it, but went right to an O'Reillys. Looked online and most things said to get 5w-40, as well as O'Reilly's computers said 5w-40 would best suit my car. Made the mistake of not looking at my engine oil cap, which literally says 5w-20 (I just noticed this today, somehow.)

Not a huge deal, just thicker than needed. I'll buy 5w-20 next time I'm out of the house. 
But my dashlight never went away in the first place, it's actually only decreased. It sat at 15% for over a month, went down to 5% for another month, and today it dropped to 0%, then in seconds to -1?? I drove less than a mile when this happened.
My dipstick reads completely fine, the oil is just meeting the second hole up. My oil doesn't smell burnt, it's a fresh amber-brown colour.

My car isn't making any typical oil-related issue sounds (from what I know), but it is making a sound that's very hard to describe. I explained it to my dad as it's similar to the sound of a toy car rolling, like one that you pull backwards and it drives forward itself. No clicking, pops, or grinding necessarily, but that smooth friction-like sound, that intensifies with acceleration. 
Maybe that's unrelated, but what the fuck is my dashlight doing????

Edit- You guys are insanely quick. I should've put more thought into the dash light appearing less as an active sensor and more as a timer from the last oil change. I'll look into changing my oil and resetting that lifespan timer.

Had new tires installed, balanced and alightment done July 30 and drove the car that day and the next on the highway with no issues

By the time Friday rolled around I was noticing a weird sensation when I was driving and the best way I could describe it is a floating sensation.  Also experiencing significant vibration - at first thought i was noticing it in the rear but later almost worse in the front.  I had the balance checked and all was fine. 

The car was a bit off before due to tires with uneven tread but nothing this extreme.  I'm hoping it's just that the alignment wasn't done properly and that taking it to get another alignment will fix it but if not any ideas what it could be?  Kind of dreading taking it on the highway until it's resolved due to how uneasy it feels.

1mj8uat,Does it make sense to join the trade?,"I (22F) have a wonderful father (50M) who since he was 12 has been a mechanic. He grew up in Mexico and has worked on things as big as rigs and as small as motorcycles. His father taught him how to work on cars and despite trying to enter other professions, he ultimately always returned to car work and now owns his  business in the SF bay area. He's been at his own shop for the last maybe 10-15 years. I am his eldest child and I feel like I have always expressed a genuine interest in auto work. When I was little living in Mex and he fixed microbuses I would be there watching and handing him tools. As I got older tho, my mom and dad didn't think it was safe for me to be around the shop a lot and never thought auto work would be a genuine career path. Perhaps because I'm a woman and mostly because they wanted me to get an ""education"" and a ""real career"" where I ""didn't have to work so much."" I think what they meant was getting a desk job or a job where I was ""paid to think""  and to ""follow my dreams."" Unfortunately, my dreams were to become a journalist/reporter and in the prime year of 2025 news media is dying and seasoned reporters are fighting over what are supposed to be entry level jobs. I'm trying to break into that industry but it is so grueling and ruthless and I simply cannot compete with ppl who have 5-7 years of experience over me. No matter how much I sell myself I always fall short.

In the summer of 2022 (I was 19)  I worked briefly with my dad and he taught me how to do oil changes, install new brakes, install a new timing chain/belt, install spark plugs and other basic stuff. I will admit my back was  SHREDDED within the first week and the first day I worked with him I slept for 15 hours upon coming home.  I only worked for like three weeks before getting an internship at a university doing comms for alumni relations which I hated but for the sake of experience I did it.

My father has a successful business, but he is nearing retirement age and I can tell he is on the down trend in term of his physical capacities. Id give him 10-15 more years tops. I obviously don't want to imagine what we're gonna do with all his tools when he passes, but I just feel like it would be a huge missed opportunity to create generational wealth through the garage before he passes. I have a pretty useless degree in journalism, and following my dreams kinda left me in an equally shitty position if I just  hadn't gone to college. My current job, which has no degree requirements, is in admin and I'm technically an ""intern""  making 27 an hour with ZERO benefits. I have a hard time even getting jobs without a degree requirement. I don't think im dumb i just think the job market is fucked and I'm young/ ""inexperienced"" So really wtf am I doing?

  
Should I just commit to my father and work under him and learn as much as I can and make the business my own when my dad steps down? How risky do you guys think this is? Will this backfire like my other career choices? Will it be harder for me to retain clientele because I am a woman? 

TLDR: My (22F) dad (50M) is a 35+ years experienced mechanic. I have a degree in liberal arts. My degree isn't helping me get a good job where I dont have to ""labor"" as hard which is what father wanted. I've always expressed interest in auto work.

I've been around the trade my whole life. my dad was a shop owner then took a position at the city. I went into the biz straight out of high school got my AA in automotive with a factory specialty. Worked at the dealer. My head always echoed with ""work smart, not hard"" so I went back to school. Started on a business degree for two years, and wound up with a BA degree in audio engineering and digital media with a music minor. I went straight out of university back into automotive. Couldn't hack it as an employee so I went independent. Been working with my dad for the last 18 years and it's been the best experience ever. 

If you know what you're doing, what you're talking about, how to talk to both sides of the ticket, how to run the front end and the back end of the shop, you'll do great. You also have the advantage of being able to bring modernity to your dad's shop. Getting his social media presence out there. Getting a modern website. Using technology for customer communication and retention. Using digital platforms for marketing. 

Your ultimate goal is to be a business owner not simply a business operator. Build the business to the point where you never have to touch a wrench again, write another ticket, sell another service. Build culture and community, train and hire, focus on growth and profit.

I'm sure your dad is a great guy who knows his stuff, but I suggest not relying solely on his experience. Get outside mentorship and education. You can take courses online from very reputable sources on business, finance, shop management and service writing. Join your local automotive service council meetings.

Truth is, you're still young enough that if you wind up not liking it, you still have the rest of your life to find a new path. But if you do like it, and find a passion for it, the sky is the limit.

Even they agreed it was repairable and shouldn't have been a cat B once we found out. We started the repairs with no update from insurance that the car was categorised.

1mje0fl,Car insurance wording query,"Hi fellow car enthusiasts.

I've recently managed to sort myself out with car insurance for another year, managing to get myself a cheaper price compared to last year which was some achievement.

So the question is in relation to this specific sentence about use of other vehicles (from MY insurance policy certificate).

*The Policyholder may also drive a private motor car not belonging to the Policyholder and not hired to the Policyholder under a Hire Purchase Agreement or leased, provided it is insured under another insurance policy, for* ***social domestic and pleasure use only*** *and with the consent of the owner.

Let's set an example. I've been asked to drive friends car back home as they're under the influence of alcohol. They have a fully comprehensive car insurance policy with social, domestic and pleasure use including drive to and from a single place of work.

In this case, because their insurance includes the 'including drive to and from a single place of work', does that mean I would not be covered to legally drive their vehicle since MY insurance certificate states ' ***social domestic and pleasure use only***'?

The single word '***only***' makes me doubtful and I am wondering if there is more educated redditors who know more about this and would be able to shed some light on this question I have.",0,1754508154.0,6,CartalkUK,1754595467,2025-08-06 19:22:34,2025-08-07 19:37:47,"Additional-Point-824 (Score: 4): I believe that the wording relates to the activities that they will cover you for, rather than the activities that the owner has insured the car for.

If it gets really bad, pull over and pop the roof up. Almost all convertibles built since the turn of the century have an electric roof that closes in seconds. Some manual tops can be closed even faster.

But yet so many of the convertible cars I see on the road keep those magnificent folding roofs firmly up, even when the weather is ripe for it! I passed half a dozen convertible cars on my way home today and not one of them had the roof down. It really confuses me. Today is a perfect day to have the roof off, it‚Äôs 16 degrees where I am, a slight seaside breeze and barely a cloud in the sky. I had the roof very much down and my journey was far more interesting as a result.

That carrying a better wheel wrench in the boot paid off finally. I've been driving almost 25 years and never had a blow out so was probably due one.

I am 23 years old and I‚Äôve just bought my first car: a 2015 64‚Äô reg manual Skoda Fabia 1.2 SE Euro 5 door, with 80k miles on itcosting just under ¬£4k. 

Now, I need advice because I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôve been scammed and I should return the car. The dealership I bought it from advertised a full service history, but on inspecting the history it‚Äôs got lots of gaps, including no documentation between 2017 and 2021. My dad and I also drove the car back home from the dealership (admittedly a 5 hour drive) and 2.5 hours in many warning signs went off in the car meaning we had to stop on the hard shoulder on the motorway. After the AA and a local garage looking over it, they found it was a coil pack issue. The timing chain has also recently been changed, which looking at the service history appears to be due to a rattling engine (I suspect this is why they sold the car). The local garage I took it to confirmed there is nothing wrong with the new timing chain. 

I bought the car because it was a smooth drive, very clean, 1 owner, and the dealership had great reviews. When dealing with them due to the coil pack issues, they were very understanding initially, but became cagey when I questioned them about the incomplete service history (which I should‚Äôve checked before the sale, I now am well aware). The dealership also refused a PPI, which at first I was fine with because of the great reviews they had, but now am wary about. 

I don‚Äôt know anything about cars, so I want to know whether I‚Äôve picked up a good car that will last me a good few years yet, or whether I should cut my losses and return it.

The most recent service was last month, but MOT expires this month. I didn't get called from the dealership the day after, so I had to call them myself, and they said that it was a PX, the car hadn't arrived in stock yet, and the previous owner was preparing it. I was a bit confused since the car was untaxed and they had put up the ad, so I assumed it might have been in the prep centre if that was the case, so I did a lot of probing and they said that:

""The customer came in with their car, and it was misdescribed, so we said that they needed to get the car up to the standard that it was described as, hence why we will not have the car for a few weeks.""

They said multiple times in call that the car was not with them but with the previous owner.

I'm a bit worried about the ""few weeks"". In my mind, if it were something easily rectifiable like alloys, the dealer would have just taken it in.

The main driving is 15 min commute, plus twice weekly 45 min travel cross country. Infrequently drive fairly long motorway distance to see family the other side of the country - the lack of cruise control on the Mazda really makes this type of journey a slog.

Features needed:

- big enough for growing family (at least 5 doors, bigger boot than the Mazda 2)
- reliable and cheap upkeep (the reason I love my current car is that it really isn‚Äôt too expensive to upkeep when serviced regularly)
- doesn‚Äôt feel so much like a go cart when navigating winding country roads

Even if we take at face value claims that E5 is marginally better for the car and so using it may result in fewer repair bills down the line (possibly in 100k miles time), you have to factor in the significantly increased cost of the fuel itself.

1miy5ou,Car issues and conflicting advice.,"I bought a 2017 Vauxhall Corsa (48,000 mileage when I bought it) approximately 18 months ago from a local dealer. At the time, I was fairly limited on the car finance I could take out due to previous credit issues so I went with a dealer that the finance company advised I could use. Since having the car, I‚Äôve had nothing but bother. I took it for a service initially and was quoted ¬£1000 to do all the work needed which at the time, I could not afford but the garage did carry out the essential work on it. About 3 months ago, the car started over heating. I took it to the garage and they replaced the thermostat which didn‚Äôt fix the issue, then they replaced the water pump (all this work along with other bits costing me several hundred pounds). A couple of weeks ago, the car started making a weird clunky sound and as I was sick by this point, I decided to take it to the Vauxhall dealership to get a diagnostic done; they came back to me saying the head gasket needs replacing.  As I was not going to pay them to do this work, I took the car to a local (and from what I‚Äôve been told fairly reliable) mechanic. He‚Äôs had a look at it and said the head gasket is fine but there is damage to the engine and the only thing I can do about that is to replace the engine! He showed me a video of the top of the engine where it does look all corroded. 

I‚Äôm in a total pickle about what to do here. I still have just over ¬£3,500 to pay on the finance, which I can‚Äôt afford to pay off right now. I don‚Äôt know whether to go with what the dealership have told me or what this mechanic has told me and whether it‚Äôs even worth getting fixed (the car is valued between ¬£2,500 and ¬£4,500).

What‚Äôs odd is that Staines Motors LTD responded to that review saying:

Digging further, I Googled their address and found a website called Your Next Car. On that site, there‚Äôs a company listed as Used Quality Cars LTD with the same address as Staines Motors LTD. When you click through to their website, it takes you to a site called Used Quality Cars, but the address listed there is completely different: UNISYS BUILDING, 31 Brentfield, London NW10 8LS.

To add to the confusion, on Auto Trader, Staines Motors LTD is listed at Unit 1 & 2 Stanwell New Rd, whereas on Google, their address is just Unit 3. It‚Äôs unclear whether this is a mistake or if they‚Äôre operating across multiple units.
