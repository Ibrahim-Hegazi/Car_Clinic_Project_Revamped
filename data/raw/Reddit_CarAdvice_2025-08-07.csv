1mjjuuy,4Runner fog lamp missing after Jiffy Lube visit,"I‚Äôm currently on a cross-country road trip and needed an oil change so I decided to swing by a Jiffy Lube in Flagstaff for service. They told me one of the bulbs in my fog lights was out, so I agreed to have it replaced. 

Feeling really stupid for this, but my partner and I didn‚Äôt check my fog lamps after the service to make sure it was properly replaced. This morning (two days after service), my partner notices that one of my entire fog LAMPS is missing. 

It‚Äôs the passenger side fog lamp that‚Äôs missing, but the invoice says the driver‚Äôs side fog light was replaced. I called the office and the manager says the video footage shows the driver‚Äôs side light getting replaced and I‚Äôm insisting they send me the proof. I have pictures of my car a couple of days before this service with both fog lamps still in my car. I don‚Äôt understand how in less than 48 hours an entire fog lamp can go missing like this coincidentally after I had a ‚Äúservice‚Äù done to replace my bulb. They insist it‚Äôs the other side they replaced and so it‚Äôs not their fault, but it‚Äôs all so fishy and doesn‚Äôt make any sense. I‚Äôve been driving 20+ hours the last few days and sleeping in my car so I don‚Äôt see how this could‚Äôve gone missing under my nose (stolen or fallen off, are those possibilities even a thing?) 

I‚Äôve sent complaints through the website as the manager is refusing to give me a refund and insisting they made a proper replacement. I‚Äôve accepted that since my partner and I didn‚Äôt immediately check after the service and the paperwork doesn‚Äôt reflect the correct fog lamp that is missing that we might not get refunded. We‚Äôre also halfway across the country now. I‚Äôm so incredibly frustrated by Jiffy Lube, but also myself for not checking and taking it as a lesson learned. I‚Äôm going to keep pressing for the video proof and move forward with the complaints regardless as I believe this is a $200+ replacement. Is there anything else I can do/is there any hope for a refund?

Post:
Hey y‚Äôall,
I‚Äôm in a real f***ed up situation and I‚Äôm begging for help from anyone who knows Nissans, immobilizers, or how to bypass this kind of thing.

I live in Oakland, CA, and I‚Äôm living out of my 1999 Infiniti QX4. A while back, someone tried to steal my ride, and during the attempt they ripped out the immobilizer antenna ring. That kicked off this whole nightmare. The ignition cylinder also got messed up, and now I‚Äôm completely locked out from starting the car.

I have no working key.
I have no crank.
No spark.
No fuel.
NATS2 is locked up hard.
And the car is at serious risk of being towed any day now.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done so far:
	‚Ä¢	Went to Pick-n-Pull and grabbed a matching ECU + immobilizer ring from a donor QX4
	‚Ä¢	Got the correct 8-pin connector and matching color wires, ready to splice
	‚Ä¢	I had an Autel KM100X tool and tried to program a new key, but I no longer have access to the tool
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôve been chasing wires, trying to trace things back, even considering removing the NATS chip from the ECU
	‚Ä¢	I have 3 ECUs and immobilizer boxes, but they‚Äôre mixed up and I don‚Äôt know which pair goes together

I‚Äôm not trying to steal anything. This is my vehicle, my shelter, and my home. I just need to get it running long enough to move it to safety before I lose everything I still have.

Please ‚Äî does anyone know:
	1.	How to bypass the NATS2 system (even temporarily)?
	2.	How to match a junkyard ECU + IMMO box without a key?
	3.	Can I just splice the correct wires to install the antenna ring and trigger unlock mode?
	4.	Is it possible to program a universal key/transponder chip without the original, now that I have the right ECU + IMMO pair?
	5.	Any shops in the Bay Area / Oakland that‚Äôll unlock or flash ECUs without charging dealership prices?
	6.	Is that method of removing the NATS chip from the ECU legit?

I‚Äôm out here trying to figure this all out on my own. I‚Äôve got tools, parts, solder, and patience ‚Äî but I need help from someone who knows how this system works inside and out. I‚Äôm down bad. And time‚Äôs running out.

Any help, advice, wiring diagrams, or even a direction to look would mean everything right now.

Please and Thank you

1mjdzla,"Switched to LEDs - brightness is there, but focus feels off.

Parts of the road ahead still seem dim or patchy, and it doesn‚Äôt feel like the light is really ‚Äúpaving‚Äù the road like my old halogens did.

I started reading up on it and came across an interesting write-up explaining that it‚Äôs not just about brightness - **beam focus and light distribution** play a huge role too. Apparently, LEDs use ‚Äúface lighting‚Äù instead of the ‚Äúspot lighting‚Äù you get with halogen filaments, which can lead to scattered beams if the lamp isn‚Äôt engineered well.

eric_gm (Score: 15): A halogen filament emits light in a 360 degree pattern. A LED chip is directional. That's why you don't put LEDs in reflectors meant for halogens (or xenon). It's physically impossible to emulate a halogen with an LED, all you get are approximations.

You'll never get the same beam pattern and you'll potentially glare oncoming drivers. Don't be that guy.

In general terms, the thinner the LED bulb ""post"" and the smaller the chips (provided they're located exactly where an incandescent filament is), the better the pattern will be, but there will always be issues with light distribution as you can't make the post that holds the chips infinitely thin. The most common is having two dark spots right above and under the directional chips which translates into dark areas/dead spots in your beam pattern.

Remove those LEDs, put the original bulbs back in. Restore your headlights if they're hazy, or do a projector retrofit which is the right way to upgrade your lights.

Today, they were able to do the sensor, but said that the truck now didn‚Äôt pass inspection because the brakes were ‚Äúmetal on metal‚Äù.

anonposting987 (Score: 1): Every answer here so far is wrong.  A 1999 Cadillac probably had VATS which was a resistor in the actual key itself.  Each key had a unique resistance that the vehicle read, and if it didn't match what was expected, it would not engage the fuel pump.  

OP Google GM VATS and see if your old key looked like the images you get and please report back.  They were pretty distinctive. There were only about 20 different resistance values, so it was not very secure, but more secure than no VATS

I used to work at a car stereo shop back in the early 2000's where I installed remote starters, which were basically a fancy way to hotwire your car.  I could bypass these with a simple relay and a resistor.

The next key based security for GM was called PK2 and had the resistor based in the ignition cylinder so it prevented hot wiring.  These needed no special keys.  

GM didn't start using transponders until something around 2003?  

$500 seems expensive for what you have.  I'd look for a second quote

Edit: Also I believe you can program these yourself if you buy a VATS key online, but you still have to have it physically cut by a locksmith and with no original key to copy that is still probably expensive.

Edit to an edit:  if you find a shady car stereo shop that has some old dudes that were doing this in the early 2000's like me, they can probably permanently disable this system so all you need is a basic key."

1mj97rz,Should I join the trade?,"I (22F) have a wonderful father (50M) who since he was 12 has been a mechanic. He grew up in Mexico and has worked on things as big as rigs and as small as motorcycles. His father taught him how to work on cars and despite trying to enter other professions, he ultimately always returned to car work and now owns his business in the SF bay area. He's been at his own shop for the last maybe 10-15 years. I am his eldest child and I feel like I have always expressed a genuine interest in auto work. When I was little living in Mex and he fixed microbuses I would be there watching and handing him tools. As I got older tho, my mom and dad didn't think it was safe for me to be around the shop a lot and never thought auto work would be a genuine career path. Perhaps because I'm a woman and mostly because they wanted me to get an ""education"" and a ""real career"" where I ""didn't have to work so much."" I think what they meant was getting a desk job or a job where I was ""paid to think"" and to ""follow my dreams."" Unfortunately, my dreams were to become a journalist/reporter and in the prime year of 2025 news media is dying and seasoned reporters are fighting over what are supposed to be entry level jobs. I'm trying to break into that industry but it is so grueling and ruthless and I simply cannot compete with ppl who have 5-7 years of experience over me. No matter how much I sell myself I always fall short.

In the summer of 2022 (I was 19) I worked briefly with my dad and he taught me how to do oil changes, install new brakes, install a new timing chain/belt, install spark plugs and other basic stuff. I will admit my back was SHREDDED within the first week and the first day I worked with him I slept for 15 hours upon coming home. I only worked for like three weeks before getting an internship at a university doing comms for alumni relations which I hated but for the sake of experience I did it.

My father has a successful business, but he is nearing retirement age and I can tell he is on the down trend in term of his physical capacities. Id give him 10-15 more years tops. I obviously don't want to imagine what we're gonna do with all his tools when he passes, but I just feel like it would be a huge missed opportunity to create generational wealth through the garage before he passes. I have a pretty useless degree in journalism, and following my dreams kinda left me in an equally shitty position if I just hadn't gone to college. My current job, which has no degree requirements, is in admin and I'm technically an ""intern"" making 27 an hour with ZERO benefits. I have a hard time even getting jobs without a degree requirement. I don't think im dumb i just think the job market is fucked and I'm young/ ""inexperienced"" So really wtf am I doing?

Should I just commit to my father and work under him and learn as much as I can and make the business my own when my dad steps down? How risky do you guys think this is? Will this backfire like my other career choices? Will it be harder for me to retain clientele because I am a woman?

TLDR: My (22F) dad (50M) is a 35+ years experienced mechanic. I have a degree in liberal arts. My degree isn't helping me get a good job where I dont have to ""labor"" as hard which is what father wanted. I've always expressed interest in auto work. Should I become an apprentice under my father for however long he has remaining in him and take over the business when he retires?

1mj976h,"Help! Newbie trying a replay attack on my car keyfobs, but URH and CC1101 are giving me trouble","Hey everyone, I'm new to this whole SDR and RF thing, and I'm trying to do a simple replay attack on my cars. I only have an RTL-SDR for capturing, so I built a tool to transmit the signals I capture using a CC1101 RF module and an ESP8266. I followed[ this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPVckkTjsd0) for guidance, but I'm completely lost on what the guy is calculating in the video.

I have two cars, and after analyzing their keyfobs with SDR++, I found that one uses FSK modulation and the other uses ASK.

The ASK signal works mostly fine. When I capture it with Universal Radio Hacker (URH), it decodes the signal and I can see the preamble and the actual data. However, when I re-transmit it using my CC1101 tool and recapture it with the RTL-SDR, the ""pause"" values are different from the original signal.

The FSK signal is where I'm really stuck. I entered the center frequency and captured the signal, but I can't see the preamble or the decoded data like I did with the ASK signal.

My main questions are:

How do you properly capture FSK signals using URH?

What exactly is the ""pause"" value in URH?

Is it even possible to accurately re-send a captured signal using the CC1101 tool I built?

What is he calculating in the video I linked?

1mj8kut,Need advice for an anti lag device for cars with Manual transmission,"I've been working on this device that tries to give you pops / burbles by cutting the spark entirely during deceleration. Its basically just a relay / switch that's placed in between the ignition coil and the sparkplug and during deceleration I manually press a button to cut the spark while keeping the accelerator pedal pressed - this way I get unburnt fuel going into the exhaust. This was going well until I realised that as soon as the ECU detects that the sparkplug is disconnected, it also stops injecting fuel. So for now I've put this idea aside but have come up with a different plan using the same device with some tweaks - An Antilag device to reduce turbo lag during upshifts.

  
The theory :  
Tweak the device a little bit to integrate it with the OBD2 port so it can receive live data such as accelerator pedal position, rpm etc.

When it detects clutch fully pressed and accelerator fully pressed and rpm > some threshold - Cut spark. Then when the clutch is released again, resume spark. This way I can keep the turbo spinning. I know this will throw a DTC but that's ok as long as it doesn't go to limp mode. What do you think? is this feasible",2,1754495973.0,15,CarHacking,1754582644,2025-08-06 15:59:33,2025-08-07 16:04:04,"Lee2026 (Score: 5): I don‚Äôt think a piggy back anti lag setup is a good idea‚Ä¶

If you cut spark, how do expect the turbo to stay spooled with no combustion?

Anti lag works by retarding timing, injecting more fuel, or using a bypass valve (rally style) to keep the turbo spooled. There is still some form of combustion to keep the turbo spinning

mastawyrm (Score: 2): The fact you thought of OBD before directly reading voltages tells me you're likely working with more modern stuff. So, OBD can be slow, you're better off listening to canbus. 

For the spark you could probably replace the on/off concept with a normal/shunt to ground through resistor so the ecu thinks things are working properly.

And finally, you know this is going to quickly burn up the turbo and/or cats right?"
1mj8uat,Does it make sense to join the trade?,"I (22F) have a wonderful father (50M) who since he was 12 has been a mechanic. He grew up in Mexico and has worked on things as big as rigs and as small as motorcycles. His father taught him how to work on cars and despite trying to enter other professions, he ultimately always returned to car work and now owns his  business in the SF bay area. He's been at his own shop for the last maybe 10-15 years. I am his eldest child and I feel like I have always expressed a genuine interest in auto work. When I was little living in Mex and he fixed microbuses I would be there watching and handing him tools. As I got older tho, my mom and dad didn't think it was safe for me to be around the shop a lot and never thought auto work would be a genuine career path. Perhaps because I'm a woman and mostly because they wanted me to get an ""education"" and a ""real career"" where I ""didn't have to work so much."" I think what they meant was getting a desk job or a job where I was ""paid to think""  and to ""follow my dreams."" Unfortunately, my dreams were to become a journalist/reporter and in the prime year of 2025 news media is dying and seasoned reporters are fighting over what are supposed to be entry level jobs. I'm trying to break into that industry but it is so grueling and ruthless and I simply cannot compete with ppl who have 5-7 years of experience over me. No matter how much I sell myself I always fall short.

In the summer of 2022 (I was 19)  I worked briefly with my dad and he taught me how to do oil changes, install new brakes, install a new timing chain/belt, install spark plugs and other basic stuff. I will admit my back was  SHREDDED within the first week and the first day I worked with him I slept for 15 hours upon coming home.  I only worked for like three weeks before getting an internship at a university doing comms for alumni relations which I hated but for the sake of experience I did it.

My father has a successful business, but he is nearing retirement age and I can tell he is on the down trend in term of his physical capacities. Id give him 10-15 more years tops. I obviously don't want to imagine what we're gonna do with all his tools when he passes, but I just feel like it would be a huge missed opportunity to create generational wealth through the garage before he passes. I have a pretty useless degree in journalism, and following my dreams kinda left me in an equally shitty position if I just  hadn't gone to college. My current job, which has no degree requirements, is in admin and I'm technically an ""intern""  making 27 an hour with ZERO benefits. I have a hard time even getting jobs without a degree requirement. I don't think im dumb i just think the job market is fucked and I'm young/ ""inexperienced"" So really wtf am I doing?

  
Should I just commit to my father and work under him and learn as much as I can and make the business my own when my dad steps down? How risky do you guys think this is? Will this backfire like my other career choices? Will it be harder for me to retain clientele because I am a woman? 

TLDR: My (22F) dad (50M) is a 35+ years experienced mechanic. I have a degree in liberal arts. My degree isn't helping me get a good job where I dont have to ""labor"" as hard which is what father wanted. I've always expressed interest in auto work. Should I become an apprentice under my father for however long he has remaining in him and take over the business when he retires?",2,1754496552.0,4,AutoMechanics,1754582644,2025-08-06 16:09:12,2025-08-07 16:04:04,"alteredpilot (Score: 2): Get in there.

I've been in business for 18 years and I wouldn't trade it for anything.

I've been around the trade my whole life. my dad was a shop owner then took a position at the city. I went into the biz straight out of high school got my AA in automotive with a factory specialty. Worked at the dealer. My head always echoed with ""work smart, not hard"" so I went back to school. Started on a business degree for two years, and wound up with a BA degree in audio engineering and digital media with a music minor. I went straight out of university back into automotive. Couldn't hack it as an employee so I went independent. Been working with my dad for the last 18 years and it's been the best experience ever. 

If you know what you're doing, what you're talking about, how to talk to both sides of the ticket, how to run the front end and the back end of the shop, you'll do great. You also have the advantage of being able to bring modernity to your dad's shop. Getting his social media presence out there. Getting a modern website. Using technology for customer communication and retention. Using digital platforms for marketing. 

Your ultimate goal is to be a business owner not simply a business operator. Build the business to the point where you never have to touch a wrench again, write another ticket, sell another service. Build culture and community, train and hire, focus on growth and profit.

I'm sure your dad is a great guy who knows his stuff, but I suggest not relying solely on his experience. Get outside mentorship and education. You can take courses online from very reputable sources on business, finance, shop management and service writing. Join your local automotive service council meetings.

Truth is, you're still young enough that if you wind up not liking it, you still have the rest of your life to find a new path. But if you do like it, and find a passion for it, the sky is the limit.
