Ive been running water in my radiator and whenever I drive for more than 10 miles water drips from there. This is a 2002 Mitsubishi lancer ES. Is there supposed to be a hose connected to it? It was hard to pin point where the water was coming from because it drips onto the motor mount and down the subframe.

1nenenb,"My car has had 3 dead batteries in the last 3 years, and the last few months it’s been having trouble starting. Dashboard says “check charge system”. Does my car have an electrical issue?","My car’s battery died in August 2022, then the replacement only lasted until December 2023, and the next replacement died in September 2024. Now for the past 4 months or so, my car has often taken several attempts to start. It doesn’t struggle or make any noise during the failed attempts, lights come on the dashboard but it just won’t start. I’d estimate this happens about 1/4 of the time that I try to start my car, the other 3/4 of the time it starts right away. However, it has never completely failed to start with this newest battery. I haven’t had to call for help yet, but today it took me over 30 minutes of trying before it would start, which is the worst it’s been by far. Usually it starts on the second or third try. A few weeks ago when it failed on the first attempt but started on the second attempt, a message came on the dashboard saying “check charge system”. That message went away once I turned the car off, and I haven’t seen it since. 

Does it sound to you like my car has an electrical issue? Another thing that could support this is that both of my headlights have gone out multiple times (although not at the same time, only one at a time), but each time the issue has been solved by slamming the hood.

Vehicle is a 2020 V8 gas engine Silverado 2500 HD. 

I moved further away from that mechanic and started pricing repair so to another dealer who I decided to get a second opinion from. They recommended replacing the solenoid again and they’d check for burnt wires or fuses while they’re down there. 

Saw a third mechanic and they said there’s really no easy fix and I can just replace different EVAP parts and may never fix the problem.

I'd do a tug test on the insulation. If the wire is broken inside where you can see it, the wire will stretch them the insulation will break. I'd do this on the initial visual inspection.

Next is another code check followed by turning it on with the scanner. Then check the diagram to see if there's a dedicated fuse. If so then check it and then see if it will light a 5 amp test light at the solenoid. 

Then load test the other wire from the PCM. Another test is grounding the solenoid at the PCM while using a volt meter on either side of the vent solenoid. 

After all that, load check powers and grounds at the PCM.

So you can see that there's some tests that can be done before replacing any more parts to be sure. 

Now you have to find a shop that can do these tests. Hope this helps your situation.

1nemf3d,Odd issue stumped two mechanics so far - Hyundai Santa Fe appears to shift into gear but won't engage wheels.,"Just hoping somebody has seen something like this before, because I had two guys look at it and they couldn't find the problem. This is a 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe. We are the second owner, since 2019.

Background, this car has been giving me trouble for a long time. We just got a new refurbished engine installed. That was working fine, for about a week and a half. Seemed like a brand new car again.

However, one day I was driving to the grocery store, entered the parking lot, stopped at a stop sign, and when I pressed the gas again it just didn't drive. The engine revved and sounded completely normal, but the car acted like it was in neutral. I hadn't changed gears or anything. I just paused at the stop sign and tried to keep driving, and I seemingly lost connection to the gear.

I pushed it to a parking space and eventually had it towed home. I had two people check.  They saw that the transmission was reacting when I shifted into reverse/neutral/drive. You can feel the tiny little thump that seems like it's going into gear. But in each position, the car acts like it's in neutral. 

There are no error codes active. We detached the battery a couple times, and one of the mechanics I had come over used a OBD2 scanner to send some kind of reset signal. There doesn't appear to be any mechanical or electrical issue that explains the behavior. We also replaced the transmission fluid just in case. 

When this happened, I had just finished a 15-minute highway drive. The parking lot was about one minute from the highway exit. I did make a pretty hard brake before I made my right turn into the parking lot, because I remembered last minute where my turn was. I can't imagine that is relevant, because I pulled into the parking lot, stopped and then drove through one stop sign, then stopped at a second stop sign before I lost propulsion. But maybe it's worth mentioning? It's the only abnormal thing about that drive before it broke.

1nem13o,Engine trouble after door repair,"Hello, wondering if someone could provide some advice. My wife was in an accident a little over a month ago, where another driver backed into the passenger side door. The damage wasn't too bad and the other driver's insurance covered the repair.

We were told it would be about a month before the shop could do the repair, so we drove the van as normal for about a month until then. There were absolutely zero other issues with the van. The van was dropped off for about 2 weeks. As soon as she picked it up on there were engine problems, juddering, etc., that were very noticeable (the same day she picked it up). The repair shop wiped their hands of any issues saying it wasn't them, but it just sounds to coincidental to me when there were zero signs of issues before that.

My wife took it to another repair shop and they told here these codes were showing up (P21a1, p11f1, p0306, p0300). What is the chances that the first repair shop had something to do with this? What can we even do if they did.

I posted in here last week about my car dying. After about 7 hours, it randomly decided to start and things have been good since. Then last night it did the same thing, only this time it wasn’t starting at all and the battery voltage was going lower each time I put a Noco boost on it.

I took out the battery and took it in to the store where they tested it. They originally said it was good but needed a charge. They called a few minutes later and said it was bad and they’d swap it under warranty.

We put the new battery in and nothing- exact same situation. The car scanner was repeatedly reading the same battery levels as the old battery.

Again, randomly, about 1.5 hours later it finally started and shows higher voltage. But, the voltage is all over the place while in park, idling. Is this normal?

This all started in 2021. We had never had battery issues until one kid left lights on. My car died and a friend jumped it. He reversed the polarity and they caught fire. It blew my amp.

Ever since then, car batteries only last a year at most. The first one was only 6 months.

The thing is I couldn't find any common pattern with the change of temperature, even if I think most of the time it goes up when I accelerate and cools when braking. But sometimes it also moves when I am not moving. I tried to show you some movements in the video, and you can see at the end that it goes to the alert (even if I am only at 20 mph).

I tried to read the fault codes with an OBD 2 reader bought on amazon but nothing appears, even if I have other problems (daylight not functioning, that's why I have the warning sign).  
Do you have any idea what could be the cause, and how could I find it ? I though of the thermostat, like a stuck close or something, but as it is going back to normal when I drive moderately I am confused.

The milage was 203050 kilometers 

After fixing all that the car drove normally and everything was fine, then the oil pressure light started flashing again in June 2025 and the mileage was around 216000 kilometers . So i parked the car for two months and in August i took it to another mechanic and he confirmed that there are no oil leaks and the problem might be the oil pressure pump so i replaced it. Now i have driven around 1600 kilometers after replacing the oil pump and the oil pressure warning light is on again. I went to the mechanic to see if the oil level is low but he confirmed that the oil level is good. 

The oil pressure light started flashing on and off a couple if days ago, now its always on and sometimes while driving it will flash again then stay on. In general the car is running and idling smoothly  and there is no loss in power. I drive it daily and no sound comes from the engine such as ticking or knocking. Power delivery is smooth even when i floor it.

Recently I've experienced this car will start beeping at me randomly, the sound is similar to that of a door being open alarm. However, it shows no codes or malfunctions on the dash, or on a code scanner. 

Yesterday while I was cruising on the highway, It did this and for a split second ""check brake system"" warning light popped up, but dissappeared immediately after.

Today, as I'm pulling into work, as I went over the speed bump, it did the alarm noise again, but no clue as to what for, then the car died for a second, all the electronics went out, but then it all came back a second later. 

I don't have reason to believe its the alternator, as its still charging within a perfectly acceptable range (14.2-14.4)

A few months prior to this, I also had an issue when I would go out to the car, it was acting as if the battery was dead, but if i came back an hour later it worked fine. Additionally if I disconnected the battery for a few minutes that would also fix the issue.

1necm6b,"It’s insane how much difference a good set of tires make, and how few people take this seriously","I have a 2021 Golf GTI, and when I bought it I was told it still had the factory tires which were worn down a bit. So I got a bit of a discount on the car for that reason. When I took it to the shop to replace the tires, they were nice enough to tell me to only replace two tires and just move the old front tires to the rear to save some money, and only put new tires on the front. They didn’t have the factory tires, so they said I could just buy cheaper tires to save some money. According to the shop, it doesn’t matter much to have different tires at the front and rear on a FWD car.

So I drove the car for over a year with mismatched front and back tires. At some point the rear tires had been worn down to illegal levels when the police checked them, and even the ‘new’ cheaper front tires were at their limits. So I had to replace all four.

I said fuck it and paid almost 1000 euros to put a set of 4 fresh Michelin Pilot Sport 5’s on the wheels, and wow. It drives like a new, better car. No more vibrations, weird noises, bad steering feel, etc. The car feels like an SUV when going over bumps compared to how it drove before.

Ever since I got these fresh new tires, I’ve been paying attention to the tires of other cars, especially performance cars. I see cars with old Michelin tires that are so worn down that even the sidewall markings have faded. You can barely read the ‘Michelin’ logo. Or I see AMG cars with weird Chinese brand tires that are also worn down. And how people just drive these cars hard on the highway during the rain, just insane. How can you pay so much for a car, maintain it, but completely forget about your tires?

1ne4thj,"Mercedes GLA 250 (2019, 82k km) – Engine failure / head gasket issue at such low mileage normal? Looking for goodwill experiences.","Hi everyone,
I’m currently facing quite a dilemma and I hope someone here has had similar experiences or can share some advice:
	•	Car: Mercedes GLA 250 4Matic, model year 2019
	•	Mileage: ~82,000 km (51k miles)
	•	Purchase: bought as a Junge Sterne certified used car from a Mercedes dealer in 2022
	•	Service history: full Mercedes dealer service history, last service including brakes just 2 months ago

The problem:
My car recently started overheating. At the Mercedes workshop they told me that coolant is probably leaking into the combustion chamber/exhaust – likely a blown head gasket or warped cylinder head. Estimated repair cost from Mercedes: €7,000–10,000.

My questions:
	•	Is this kind of failure “normal” at 82k km, or does it point to a design/series issue?

	•	Has anyone here had experience with Mercedes goodwill (Kulanz) in such cases? What’s realistic in terms of cost coverage (parts, labor, percentage)?

	•	Would you go straight to an independent Mercedes specialist workshop, or first try to negotiate with Mercedes?

	•	Are there known issues with coolant/head gaskets on the GLA / M274 engines?

Honestly, I can’t believe a premium car suffers a major engine failure at just 3 years old and under 100k km. Legally, it seems I can only hope for goodwill, since warranty/guarantee expired after 2 years – but maybe some of you have real-world experience with how far Mercedes is willing to go.

I specifically chose a 3-year-old Junge Sterne car from Mercedes to avoid exactly this kind of situation, and made sure to have every service done at Mercedes. Even the guy at the workshop just said he understood my frustration and that he hadn’t seen such a case before… but that doesn’t really help me. Now they’re checking internally for goodwill, and I’m waiting for feedback.

1ndzjxc,Why does my coolant looks like this?,"I have a 2004 honda civic LX manual transmission.  

I got all 7 hoses and a new thermostat replaced by my mechanic.     
When I got it back, the A/C was now blowing hot air, to which they said I needed a Freon recharge.  

I got the Freon recharge after a 5 days of the car working fine, but started having issues 2 days later. The A/C was now cold, but the overflow tank started filling up to almost to the cap at the top of the tank, and the heater was blowing cold air. I burped the radiator it twice before it started putting out hot air.  

I have driven it maybe 200 miles since the first repair and the coolant I pumped out of the overflow reservoir looks like this (they said they used the Green coolant) and I've been adding the ASTM D3306 yellow universal 50/50 to it but plan to flush it shortly. There are no visible particulates and it looks bright dark green when I shined a flashlight under it.  

**QUESTIONS**  

1. What would cause the A/C to blow hot air when it was blowing mildly cold air up to the day of the hose and thermostat replacement?
2. What would cause new coolant to look like this after 200 miles? There is some black residue on the inside of the overflow tank that wipes away fine with a paper towel.
3. Could they have used the wrong coolant (like something with silicate), not diluted it, not bled the radiator, installed the hoses or thermostat wrong? Maybe they didn't properly clamp one of the hoses or a defective thermostat or radiator?
4. If the head gasket is blown, is it possible to determine when the head gasket issue happened? They did a pressure test after replacing the hoses and said it was fine. Could the head gasket have blown or hot spots developed because they didn't bleed the radiator properly
5. Could they have damaged something when recharging the freon or could somebody have intentionally damaged my car?

It could be a blown head gasket, but the car has not overheated since I got it back, there is no oil in the coolant, no coolant in the oil, no white smoke from exhaust, no power loss, no warning lights, and no visible leaking coolant despite needing to add if I ever have to drive.

As for engine damage, I dont think it harms the engine too much. It may be a tiny fraction of increased wear, but usually the engine doesnt stay off long enough to let oil drain out, which is the main concern. The starters are (usually) engineered to be way stronger than necessary so that the frequent stopping and starting doesnt wear them out too soon.

1ndvzg0,Small shop left car 4 quarts low after an oil change.,"Avalon ran from July 28 through September 7th w/only one quart of oil instead of five with filter. Need help with remediation routes & considerations. Detail:

* Car: **2001 Toyota Avalon V6**, \~**181,800 miles**.

* Synthetic oil change on **7/28/2025** at a small shop.

* In the week before **9/7/2025** the engine got louder/rough.

* On **9/7/2025** I checked oil: dipstick below the lower mark; I added **4 quarts** to reach the upper dot.

* So it likely ran with **\~1 quart** from **7/28 to 9/7.**

* I have the oil service credit card receipt, **9/7 oil receipts**, and photos.

* **Goal:** avoid a low-ball “total.” Avoid being given a low-ball totaled-car settlement. Rebuild may total the car, but **replacement cost** for a comparable Avalon in my real market could be **up to \~$6,000** (I’m focused on actual replacement cost for an exactly similar, not theoretical or lame actual-cash-value (ACV). One reason I bought the Avalon was for its front bench. If in the chance I could get $6K, I'd use that money to probably buy another van though (partial help w/a van). But, I'm ok with keeping my Avalon too if it's verifiably not damaged in impactful ways from the oil starvation.

**Draft evaluation plan (please sanity-check & provide feedback):**

**Step A) Quick, decisive check (shop or their insurer pays):**

* **Mechanical oil-pressure at fully hot idle** (note oil temp).

* **Quick borescope photos** of one cylinder wall and one cam/lifter.

* **Signed note** with the raw PSI and photos.

**Step B) Full diagnostics (only if A flags trouble):**

* Oil pressure **hot idle + 2,000 rpm** (mechanical gauge).

* **Compression + leak-down** on all cylinders (values, % loss, leak paths).

* **Borescope photos** of all cylinders and valvetrain (lifters/cams).

* **Used-oil and filter** inspection for metal; **retain the filter** if debris present.

* **External leaks / drain plug / filter seating / PCV** check.

* **Deliverables:** signed report with tech name + **ASE credentials**, date/time, raw numbers, photos, short idle-noise video.

Option A, may cost $100 to $300?

Option B for checking, maybe $700 to $1500, just to check, right.

**Questions:**

1. Best leverage: have the shop **open a garagekeepers/garage liability claim** and **direct-pay** a neutral shop for **A** (and **B** only if needed)? Or really should go a full diag set (option B) up front?

1. If damage is confirmed via A or B or both, is it ok to let the **original shop** repair **only with** OEM/equivalent parts, **12-month/12k-mile warranty**, and **pre/post hot-idle oil-pressure numbers** in writing—or push for both inspection and repairs be done at different shops?

1. Good or bad to press for help from the shop's insurer? Due to the age of the car, is this a worse option or ok?

1. If the insurer wants to **total** it, how do I push for **true replacement** (price of a comparable Avalon within a practical radius **+ tax/DMV + transport/rental**) rather than bare actual cash value (e.g. what KBB may spit out, which is way below $6000)?

1. Advice on how to deal with a situation like this, to get help & reasonable remediation. If you suggest something completely different, let me know also.

Car has been a family car, with wife & kids often inside. Drive up canyons. Don't really want my engine to explode while I'm going up a canyon, or on a freeway somewhere. Kind of tempted to press for a $6000 settlement, rather than to pursue any repairs. But, no shop has inspected the engine yet. Yes maybe $6K is unreasonable, or is it? Damage is damage, and rebuilding an engine isn't free either.

After adding 4 quarts on September 7th, including a quart of stabilizing oil, the engine is more quiet but still sounds to me a bit louder than before the whole timeline.

Seeking input on best steps & considerations.

1nem8a5,Buick Vs. Honda Need Help!!," Hi Everyone! So I'm a broke college student who's blessed enough to have a mom who bought me a car. Last year in July she bought me a 2010 Honda Accord off Facebook marketplace. It has 175k miles and some cosmetic issues (paint peeling on outside, previous owners spilled stuff inside) but I love her none the less! Unfortunately, the car has given us a lot of issues since it's buying, my mom has had to pay for probably $2-3 thousand dollars in repairs on it since she bought it. Stuff like the power steering pump along with several other issues I can't remember the name of honestly. It's been a few months since the last issue and it's been smooth sailing so far. I think all the issues could've been from the previous owners not taking care of it but still, obviously my mom is not happy and she really wants to get rid of the car. 

 Now here's the opportunity. My great grandmother has gotten really sick over the past year and a half, she's doing okay for ninety, but unfortunately due to her health she can no longer drive. She had a Buick Encore (I think it's a 2014 but I honestly don't know) in her possession that my family now has to figure out what to do with. We haven't had it looked at yet, but it drives great, has 80k miles, and unlike my car the AC actually blows cold lol. My family wants me to take this car so they can get rid of the Honda. But, not to sound ridiculous, I've grown so attached my car! I love her, even with her rough around the edges-ness and overall, I just want to make sure that taking the Buick would be the right decision.

So I want to know, how do Buicks compare to Honda's? I'll be driving one of these cars for a long time probably, so I want to make sure it can last a good while. I don't know anything about cars so I'd love some insight, thank you!!",1,1757628819.0,6,carquestions,1757705566,2025-09-11 22:13:39,2025-09-12 19:32:46,"Time_Explanation1212 (Score: 1): The question is whether you should get a car with much lower mileage than the high mileage car.

1nen0ad,2017 Honda Fit EX 1.5L Manual Transmission - ABS/traction control lights on following ABS sensor replacement,"This post is specifically about the ABS/traction control lights, but some background in case it helps diagnose the problem.

In June I replaced the clutch in my car. Following the replacement I noticed several lights come on the dash which did not go off after the normal testing period, including the ABS and traction control lights, Electronic Power Steering (EPS). None of those were on prior to the start of the work. TPMS light is also on, but it has been for a year (just a bad sensor according to the tire shop.) There is no problem with the actual power steering so I am unsure if EPS light is just a symptom of the same problem.

[ABS, EPS, traction control lights on after start up test period.](https://preview.redd.it/45h08qin5mof1.jpg?width=6120&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c1990c29c83b6dc2b9fdd9bc3ae97c61184d207c)

I had AutoZone read the codes and the only thing that came back was the front driver ABS/wheel speed sensor was not working. I pulled the tire off and found the sensor was completely detached from the wheel (it had ripped clean offf.)

[Sensor wire detached from wheel.](https://preview.redd.it/gu0smpq06mof1.jpg?width=6120&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8274e4c240e1c049b0ff8e7cfab2481589b1938)

Today I replaced the ABS sensor with a brand new one, made sure everything was secure (sensor firmly screwed to wheel, connector at the other end is snapped in secure.)

[New ABS sensor installed](https://preview.redd.it/yqkm303c6mof1.jpg?width=6120&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0a93823d80edeb0f7c77fa317c733c4c0a4756e9)

After this was done I turned it on and waited for the test to complete but the lights still stayed on. After reading up on it I tried the following:

  
\-2 different short trips between 15-30 mph to see if it would calibrate

\-Disconnected battery for about 2 minutes and connected it again.

Is there anything else I can try? What should I check if another code reading says it is still the sensor? I would think that the obvious issue with it being ripped clean off would have been the culprit but maybe something else happened to occur at the same time?

If you dont have the money to replace the converter right now and just need to pass emissions you can drain out 2 quarts of fluid through the drain plug in the transmission and replace them with 2 quarts of Lucas  Transmission Fix (around $20/quart). It is a very thick additive and will raise the hydraulic pressure in the transmission enough that the converter clutch will lock like its supposed to.

1ne0lw3,How can I fix this?,So I have a 2013 subaru outback that was going through oil like crazy for a while but after switching from valvoline to mobil1 I'm no longer having to add oil so maybe that fixed it not sure. But during the process of looking for a leak I found the bottom of my radiator very wet so I checked the coolant and it was pretty low in the reservoir but the radiator was still full. So I got up under the car and seen this hose coming out of the radiator on the passenger side and I let the car run and I seen the drips coming out from it.  Not sure what this hose is there is 2 of them ones on the left side and the other is on the right. I tried to tighten it but it didn't seem to be getting any tighter. I'm afraid to try too hard incase I crack the radiator from over tightening. But if anyone could steer me in the right direction to get this fixed in very low on funds so I'd like to try and fix it myself just not sure where to start or what I should be doing,3,1757568689.0,9,mechanic,1757705566,2025-09-11 05:31:29,2025-09-12 19:32:46,"According-While2935 (Score: 1): Trans cooler pipes you can try changing hose clips just trim a little off the hoses and put new clips on

1ndw1dq,"Every time I say basic things to my mechanic, he and his staff member usually turns it back on me, blames me or say they're confused or I never did this or that.","The owner usually says things like ""you NEVER picked up my calls"", ""I NEVER heard back from you"", ""you NEVER called me back"", ""you NEVER came"".

I tried to talk to him and then he cut me off and said ""I know"" and then he talked the whole time and didn't let me speak. And then he said ""DONT START ON ME. DONT START ON ME. DONT START ON ME"".

And then when I went back home, i looked at my phone call history and it shows i picked up his calls. And I went to his shop in person and talked to his other staff member. But the owner wasnt there at the time, so the owner doesnt know I came in person. So thats how I know I should be calling him instead of going in person which literally has no evidence of me being at his shop in person. At least when I call him, the calls will be logged.

Today, I went to his shop at 8.50am. And I asked the mechanic employee, ""is John here yet?"" And then mechanic employees was really confused. And he said ""yet? He's been here for weeks"". Turns out, the owner wasnt actually at the shop today yet. But the mechanic employee misinterpreted what i said and thought i meant ""is john back from his holiday yet?"" I checked my calendar and calculated that John came back from his short holiday 2.5 weeks ago. I should've been literal by asking ""Is john here today yet?"" Hopefully that wouldnt have been misinterpreted.

And then I talked to the mechanic employee about our car and how the owner said he'd order a part in and to bring our car in today at 9am. And the mechanic was so confused and was looking at the bookings and paperwork. And he said there's nothing here, you're not booked, there's no record of any order, nothing, you were never here"". I said I'll call the owner and as I was about to leave, I look down on the table in front of me, and I see a piece of A4 paper on a clipboard and it had my mobile number, number plate, VIN, the part that was ordered. And I said ""oh this is me, this is me"". And the mechanic employee said ""oh"".

And then I went back to my car, and i called the owner and the owner said ""I NEVER heard back from you"". So the 9am session didn't exist so I just drove back home. So now I have to call him again when I want to book.

Is this a normal experience? I didnt tell the owner ""my phone call history says I picked up"". Because i dont want to argue or fight with him so much, because he could literally do something bad to my car while fixing it. E.g. fix what we agree to have fix, but then put in bad oil or damage another part of the car.

The only reason im coming to this mechanic is because he was recommended to me by his old employer (he has now opened his own shop and does call-outs, which his old employer doesnt do) and then I got my car fixed by him at the start of the year, but then the car broke again for the same issue, so I'm coming back to him so he can fix it again, and he said he won't charge me as much as other mechanics will, as other mechanics will.

The owner was really nice at the start of the year. But ever since I came back to get the same issue fixed, he hasnt been so nice.

Edit: i live in an english speaking country. The owner and mechanic employee speak english fluently and with no accent. I'm also born and raised in this english speaking country. So there shouldn't be any language barriers.

Because of this, I'm asking for written warranty. I dont want to come back a few months later to fix the same issue again and pay more money.

1ndvzzs,Indie shop left car 4 quarts low after an oil change. Best next moves?,"Avalon ran from July 28 through September 7th with only one quart of oil instead of five with filter. Need help with remediation routes & considerations. Detail:

* Car: **2001 Toyota Avalon V6**, \~**181,800 miles**.
* Synthetic oil change on **7/28/2025** at a small shop.
* In the week before **9/7/2025** the engine got louder/rough.
* On **9/7/2025** I checked oil: dipstick below the lower mark; I added **4 quarts** to reach the upper dot.
* So it likely ran with **\~1 quart** from **7/28 to 9/7.**
* I have the oil service credit card receipt, **9/7 oil receipts**, and photos.
* **Goal:** avoid a low-ball “total.” Avoid being given a low-ball totaled-car settlement. Rebuild may total the car, but **replacement cost** for a comparable Avalon in my real market could be **up to \~$6,000** (I’m focused on actual replacement cost for an exactly similar, not theoretical or lame actual-cash-value (ACV). One reason I bought the Avalon was for its front bench. If in the chance I could get $6K, I'd use that money to probably buy another van though (partial help w/a van). But, I'm ok with keeping my Avalon too if it's verifiably not damaged in impactful ways from the oil starvation.

**Draft evaluation plan (please sanity-check & provide feedback):**

**Step A) Quick, decisive check (shop or their insurer pays):**

* **Mechanical oil-pressure at fully hot idle** (note oil temp).
* **Quick borescope photos** of one cylinder wall and one cam/lifter.
* **Signed note** with the raw PSI and photos.

**Step B) Full diagnostics (only if A flags trouble):**

* Oil pressure **hot idle + 2,000 rpm** (mechanical gauge).
* **Compression + leak-down** on all cylinders (values, % loss, leak paths).
* **Borescope photos** of all cylinders and valvetrain (lifters/cams).
* **Used-oil and filter** inspection for metal; **retain the filter** if debris present.
* **External leaks / drain plug / filter seating / PCV** check.
* **Deliverables:** signed report with tech name + **ASE credentials**, date/time, raw numbers, photos, short idle-noise video.

Option A, may cost $100 to $300?

Option B for checking, maybe $700 to $1500, just to check, right.

**Questions:**

1. Best leverage: have the shop **open a garagekeepers/garage liability claim** and **direct-pay** a neutral shop for **A** (and **B** only if needed)? Or really should go a full diag set (option B) up front?
2. If damage is confirmed via A or B or both, is it ok to let the **original shop** repair **only with** OEM/equivalent parts, **12-month/12k-mile warranty**, and **pre/post hot-idle oil-pressure numbers** in writing—or push for both inspection and repairs be done at different shops?
3. Good or bad to press for help from the shop's insurer? Due to the age of the car, is this a worse option or ok?
4. If the insurer wants to **total** it, how do I push for **true replacement** (price of a comparable Avalon within a practical radius **+ tax/DMV + transport/rental**) rather than bare actual cash value (e.g. what KBB may spit out, which is way below $6000)?
5. Advice on how to deal with a situation like this, to get help & reasonable remediation. If you suggest something completely different, let me know also.

Car has been a family car, with wife & kids often inside. Drive up canyons. Don't really want my engine to explode while I'm going up a canyon, or on a freeway somewhere. Kind of tempted to press for a $6000 settlement, rather than to pursue any repairs. But, no shop has inspected the engine yet. Yes maybe $6K is unreasonable, or is it? Damage is damage, and rebuilding an engine isn't free either.

After adding 4 quarts on September 7th, including a quart of stabilizing oil, the engine is more quiet but still sounds to me a bit louder than before the whole timeline.

1ndvjcb,"Can a Carfax ""minor"" front end accident result in a timing chain replacement?","I'm interested in a 2014 Honda CR-V but am a little concerned about something on its service record. Carfax cites a ""minor"" accident in the front, supposedly just cosmetic. The service record seems pretty routine, though the timing chain was entirely replaced in 2024. 

Worth nothing that the car is in shockingly good condition in terms of rust. It's been in New England for 11 years and has the rust of a New England car half its age. The rest of the service record indicates that the owner kept up with repairs, so I don't think the timing chain just crapped out due to extreme neglect of the car.

Could the timing chain replacement somehow be related to the ""minor"" accident on the front of the car? Because if so, that to me suggests it wasn't actually a minor accident and there could be other problems with the engine or structure. 

On the other hand, it's possible the owner just replaced it when it hit 100K miles because they did so much other upkeep work.

He initially said he didn’t want to replace it and only wanted to fix it with a family friend mechanic, which I thought okay that’s fine we could work things out and I could pay out of pocket, thinking it would be close to atleast $500. About 2 weeks later he comes back with an estimate of $1500. Stating on the paper, 1) Replace Front Bumper 2) Replace Metal Reinforcement 3) Replace Fog Light Grille 4) Paint and Clear Coat (Pic provided). Like what? It went from fix to replace. 

I then brought up id mostly likely want to go through insurance instead of paying the $1500. Today was Wednesday and i told him im going to have to look into it and id let him know by this week maybe next week. He started to push me and was like how about Friday? Seems fishy.

I’ve told my family, friends, co workers. They all think that the infinity owner is trying to get a payout from me and that they’re going to pocket the cash. Or that they are trying to fix something/everything else that may be already broken. Because the day we met up to get the estimate I looking at the bumper and it’s all scuffed and scratches.

I rub the soap on the rear belt ( i think it's P/S, didn't check thoroughly) and belt practically disappears. We go for test drive. When traveling straight or putting ANY tension on the steering wheel to the right, there is a HUGE LOUD rumble sound, which seems to follow tire RPMS. I'm talking super-obvious and not subtle. However, ANY tension to the left on the steering wheel, even slightly, and the noise goes completely away. Upon research, everything seems to point to a bad wheel bearing. So I tell my dad I'll buy the part and install it this weekend and he leaves. Then, he calls me not 2 minutes later and says that noise is definitely much louder than what it was when he first arrived. He actually felt unsure about continuing to drive.

I'm cleaning out some oll passages for suspected blockages. I'm trying to figure out which organic solvent will be best. The three options seem to be carb cleaner, brake cleaner, and electrical contact cleaner. Based on what i know, all three do basically the same thing, but the latter two leave less residue. 

Backstory (tldr)

A few years ago, I replaced the turbox in my car (E61 bmw, 120k miles, 2010). I drive sedately, and only a couple thousand miles a year. 

I've been chasing down leaks since then trying to rdduce oil consumption. Town driving, it's fine. Highway driving, it can lose a quart in 100 miles. I've traced it down to the turbos. I drained/cleaned the intercooler, checked the next week and had oil in it again.

Based on the oll level ""magically"" going up once in a while, my guess is the turbos are not draining oil properly, and blowing excess through the seals. So, I want to clean out the turbo oil chambers from any buildup. I will be preoiling the turbos after with moly lubricant on reassembly. 

No, I'm not willing to drop another few thousand dollars to replace basically new turbos, especially on a car that's barely worth that.

Occasionally, when shifting into Drive (D), the transmission exhibits a delayed reaction. Could this be an early sign of automatic transmission failure?","An automotive automatic transmission is a complex assembly. Its components include a fluid-filled housing containing a torque converter that operates a series of hydraulically driven clutches and brakes. In any hydraulic system, the quality of the lubricant becomes a critical factor for efficient, rapid, and reliable operation.

In this context, automatic transmission fluid (ATF) provides the pressurized medium needed to activate various internal components. Over time, ATF degrades and loses its viscosity, leading to wear.

A timely ATF replacement undoubtedly extends the transmission lifespan. However, wear from friction components and occasional faulty valves can cause significant transmission performance decline. Common symptoms include sluggish shifting, frequent delays when transitioning from Neutral (N) to Drive (D) or Reverse (R), and in extreme cases, difficulty executing both upshifts and downshifts.

When this occurs, vehicle owners can either locate a reputable repair shop to replace the worn transmission or entrust the original transmission to a specialist for a complete rebuild.",0,1757582928.0,7,AskMechanics,1757705566,2025-09-11 09:28:48,2025-09-12 19:32:46,"moomooicow (Score: 2): Why are you siting AI blabber to us?

Way I find out is this. With engine cold, make sure coolant is topped up. With cooling system pressure cap removed, start engine. If the coolant rises instead of getting sucked back into the engine by the water pump, it’s likely a head gasket allowing combustion into the cooling system. Hopefully you may need something like a new pressure cap. You say you’ve already done a thermostat. 

At least try the cap off cold start first and see what it’s doing. You can also get a combustion leak detection kit, usually fairly cheap form most auto parts stores. But it is usually obvious with a fuel like smell in the coolant if it’s that."
1ndzgi0,Need help,"I need some help and advice because I’m really confused about my car’s AC.
I had my AC compressor replaced by a mechanic, so this is a brand-new compressor. The issue is that it’s very noisy, and I’ve already taken it back to him twice, but it’s still making the same noise.
Here’s what he originally told me before replacing the compressor:
“The reason your AC compressor failed was due to there being moisture in the system. The cause of that failure is the expansion valve — it either clogged or it simply failed. I wasn’t able to identify it earlier because the system wasn’t operating properly. The good news is the part is only about $20 before tax and it’s easier to replace. Would you like to get it done in addition to the compressor replacement?”
After he replaced the compressor and I took the car back again because of the noise, this is what he told me:
“After the diagnostic, the AC is still blowing cold and the buttons are operating as they should. The squeal you’ve been hearing seems to be a normal noise, as I heard it as well when I first worked on your car. But if it gets worse, or if the AC stops working completely, I will warranty your AC compressor and replace it.”
On another visit, he also told me this:
“Alright, so I checked the gap between the compressor clutch and compressor to make sure there is no drag, and it’s within specification. While I had it off, I also added lubrication to it to make it less noisy, but ultimately it didn’t do much. The reason it’s louder is because it’s not a factory compressor — it’s an aftermarket one. This is all I can do without replacing it again.”
So now I’m stuck wondering: is it really “normal” for a brand-new aftermarket AC compressor to be this noisy? Has anyone else had this happen?

1.	⁠Changed the differential oil, was shiny and had some particles and minimal metal shavings on the plugs from what I saw. Referenced other videos and pictures and would say it was pretty standard. I didn’t remove the cover, don’t have all my tools, but I’m planning on doing that soon if I can’t diagnose the issue.
2.	⁠Thought maybe it was the wheel bearing on the front tires. So I jacked up the truck and I couldn’t spin the left tire. Turns out the caliper was seized. Changed out the rotor, calipers and pads. Still made noise.
3.	⁠Checked the exhaust system, didn’t do a great job as I did this during the night with my phone but couldn’t find anything. Checked at the exhaust tip and I did feel pressure coming out. Did notice a small pinhole on the muffler but nothing that would cause the noise.

Any help or insight is much appreciated. ",6,1757564132.0,9,AskMechanics,1757705566,2025-09-11 04:15:32,2025-09-12 19:32:46,"Fredlegrande (Score: 3): Wheel bearing?

Now for the past 4 months or so, my car has often taken several attempts to start. It doesn’t struggle or make any noise during the failed attempts, lights come on the dashboard but it just won’t start. I’d estimate this happens about 1/4 of the time that I try to start my car, the other 3/4 of the time it starts right away. However, it has never completely failed to start with this newest battery. I haven’t had to call for help yet, but today it took me over 30 minutes of trying before it would start, which is the worst it’s been by far. Usually it starts on the second or third try. A few weeks ago when it failed on the first attempt but started on the second attempt, a message came on the dashboard saying “check charge system”. That message went away once I turned the car off, and I haven’t seen it since.

1ndw3g7,Shop left car 4 quarts low after an oil change. Best next moves?,"Avalon ran from July 28 through September 7th with only one quart of oil instead of five with filter. Need help with remediation routes & considerations. Detail:

* Car: **2001 Toyota Avalon V6**, \~**181,800 miles**.

* Synthetic oil change on **7/28/2025** at a small shop.

* In the week before **9/7/2025** the engine got louder/rough.

* On **9/7/2025** I checked oil: dipstick below the lower mark; I added **4 quarts** to reach the upper dot.

* So it likely ran with **\~1 quart** from **7/28 to 9/7.**

* I have the oil service credit card receipt, **9/7 oil receipts**, and photos.

* **Goal:** avoid a low-ball “total.” Avoid being given a low-ball totaled-car settlement. Rebuild may total the car, but **replacement cost** for a comparable Avalon in my real market could be **up to \~$6,000** (I’m focused on actual replacement cost for an exactly similar, not theoretical or lame actual-cash-value (ACV). One reason I bought the Avalon was for its front bench. If in the chance I could get $6K, I'd use that money to probably buy another van though (partial help w/a van). But, I'm ok with keeping my Avalon too if it's verifiably not damaged in impactful ways from the oil starvation.

**Draft evaluation plan (please sanity-check & provide feedback):**

**Step A) Quick, decisive check (shop or their insurer pays):**

* **Mechanical oil-pressure at fully hot idle** (note oil temp).

* **Quick borescope photos** of one cylinder wall and one cam/lifter.

* **Signed note** with the raw PSI and photos.

**Step B) Full diagnostics (only if A flags trouble):**

* Oil pressure **hot idle + 2,000 rpm** (mechanical gauge).

* **Compression + leak-down** on all cylinders (values, % loss, leak paths).

* **Borescope photos** of all cylinders and valvetrain (lifters/cams).

* **Used-oil and filter** inspection for metal; **retain the filter** if debris present.

* **External leaks / drain plug / filter seating / PCV** check.

* **Deliverables:** signed report with tech name + **ASE credentials**, date/time, raw numbers, photos, short idle-noise video.

Option A, may cost $100 to $300?

Option B for checking, maybe $700 to $1500, just to check, right.

**Questions:**

1. Best leverage: have the shop **open a garagekeepers/garage liability claim** and **direct-pay** a neutral shop for **A** (and **B** only if needed)? Or really should go a full diag set (option B) up front?

1. If damage is confirmed via A or B or both, is it ok to let the **original shop** repair **only with** OEM/equivalent parts, **12-month/12k-mile warranty**, and **pre/post hot-idle oil-pressure numbers** in writing—or push for both inspection and repairs be done at different shops?

1. Good or bad to press for help from the shop's insurer? Due to the age of the car, is this a worse option or ok?

1. If the insurer wants to **total** it, how do I push for **true replacement** (price of a comparable Avalon within a practical radius **+ tax/DMV + transport/rental**) rather than bare actual cash value (e.g. what KBB may spit out, which is way below $6000)?

1. Advice on how to deal with a situation like this, to get help & reasonable remediation. If you suggest something completely different, let me know also.

Car has been a family car, with wife & kids often inside. Drive up canyons. Don't really want my engine to explode while I'm going up a canyon, or on a freeway somewhere. Kind of tempted to press for a $6000 settlement, rather than to pursue any repairs. But, no shop has inspected the engine yet. Yes maybe $6K is unreasonable, or is it? Damage is damage, and rebuilding an engine isn't free either.

After adding 4 quarts on September 7th, including a quart of stabilizing oil, the engine is more quiet but still sounds to me a bit louder than before the whole timeline.

Seeking input on best steps and considerations.

1ndun0u,"Should I repair and sell my car, or just junk it?","I have a 2006 Nissan Altima which used to be my main mode of transportation. It was old, but very reliable, I never had any significant issues with it. Unfortunately, I got in an accident with it a while back, but apart from some cosmetic damage (a scratch across one side of the car - both doors) all it did was break one of the headlight covers (light still works fine), mess up the bit of the frame that surrounds the wheel (the ""wheel well"" I think according to Google?), and destroy a tire. I got it repaired by a mechanic including getting a couple of new tires to replace the bad ones and it drove well afterwards, the only real problem seemed to be that when hitting bumps the repaired wheel well seems to scrape the tire. Also the shocks are kinda shot, which doesn't help that but is pretty expensive to fix.

After the accident I pretty quickly got a new car which I'm very happy with. I intended to sell my old Altima but dragged my feet on it a bit, in part because I thought Trump's tariffs had a high chance of increasing the value of cars and car parts so I might get more for it. But I was lazy and didn't drive it for the better part of a year and now it won't start. The battery has a bunch of gook around its terminals, and I assume that it might be ruined because it was out of use for so long, but I haven't tried cleaning it up to test that yet.  
  
I did successfully jump it maybe a month or two ago and it seemed to drive fine then, but the last time I tried several weeks ago it started briefly, then cut off and wouldn't cut back on (also my key got stuck in the ignition somehow). 

I'm thinking of finally getting rid of it for good, and I'm wondering if it's worth it to get it towed to a mechanic for possible repairs, after which I would try to sell it, or if after having not driven it for so long there could be greater problems than just the battery and I'm better off selling it for parts. It always was a good car and I feel like it'd be a shame to just get rid of it, but I'm not really sure how much my negligence might've changed it and I certainly don't want to sell a lemon.

1ndufry,"Bad wheel bearing, bad cv joint, both, or none of the above?","( 2013 Kia Soul ! , 2.0L Automatic Transmission)
So, I've been trying to figure this out for a few weeks now and at this point I'm so close to giving up but I'm trying real hard not to with the limited time I have outside of work and school to fix this issue.

Over the past few months, our Kia Soul has been developing a progressively worsening noise on the front passenger side that occurs during rotation and worsens as speed increases. I took it to a local shop and they straight up told me they couldn't figure out what was making the sound but that it has a loose steering coupler (despite the fact that I told them I was aware of the coupler issue and that it wasn't the noise I was bringing it in for prior to their attempt at a diagnostic). 

Things of note that may be relevant:
- At highway speeds, the noise is so loud that you have to yell to hear your own voice. 
- There is a mild shaking in the steering wheel when driving straight at high speeds.
- There is no pulling to one side or the other, and turning is easy.
- The noise is still present in drive, reverse, and neutral.
- I know sounds are subjective, but the best way I can describe the sound is like scraping and... it just *sounds* like it's *rotational*, if that makes sense?

At this point, I'm really leaning towards it being a bad wheel bearing, but with that movement of the axle, I'm starting to doubt myself. Any suggestions on whether y'all think this is a bearing issue, an axle/joint issue, or maybe I'm completely wrong and it's something else entirely?

I'm not afraid to go forward with replacing either of those parts, but given my limited availability, I'd like to not lose time (or money tbh) on a part that isn't the issue

1nel3pb,15k miles/year - keep my Macan diesel at 94k or stretch to a 911 / alternative as a daily /?,"Hey all,

I’ve just done the maths on my commute and I’m hitting around 15,000 miles a year. My current daily is a Porsche Macan Diesel on 94k miles. It’s been solid and costs me £409/month, but with the miles climbing I’m debating whether to just keep it until it dies, or switch while it still holds some value.

Bit of context:
	•	My wife uses our Volvo XC90 (company car), so the Macan is my personal car.
	•	Commute is mostly M62 runs into Manchester/Yorkshire, with the odd run to York.
	•	I’ve got £15k in the Macan + £5k cash, so about £20k to put down. I’d be comfortable stretching to ~£40k total car value on finance.
	•	I want a car I can use daily, but also something that makes me want to drive.

The dream option in my head is a 911 (probably older 997 or 991 territory to fit budget). But I’m realistic — it would be my only car, doing 15k miles a year, and I know running costs/servicing/insurance will bite.

So I’m torn:
	1.	Keep the Macan – sensible, known history, cheapish at £409/month. Probably push it past 100k without too much hassle.
	2.	Step into a fun daily (~£40k) – 911 if I can, or alternatives (F-Type, Cayman, M3/M4, etc.).
	3.	Go left-field – something hybrid/EV that’s cheaper to run daily, and save the “fun” money for a weekend car down the line.

Leaning hard toward the 911 because I don’t want to look back and think “I should’ve just gone for it”. But is it a stupid move for 15k miles/year? Anyone dailying one in the UK ( or something similar) how bad is it really?

Would love to hear thoughts, and if not a 911, what you’d pick around £40k that balances fun + daily usability ( preferably all wheel drive / 4wd)

My parents have told me they’ll cover insurance fully and the premiums (for cars listed below) don’t seem too bad for a first time driver as I’m an accountant working in the civil service. All around the £1k mark. 

I’m mainly looking for a car which is relatively reliable (I live in London and the car will be in Nottingham so won’t be driven that often unless my parents need to use it and they’re cautious drivers). I have limited experience of fixing cars and can really only service, though of course I wouldn’t mind some ‘cheap’ things going wrong (max £500 for part cost) so that I can get some hands-on learning. Got a few enthusiasts in the family who have most of the tools required. 

Obviously I’d like something with a clutch pedal but I really don’t mind having an auto. I’ve test driven an SL and the auto in that was shit, but I wouldn’t mind a DCT or a recent ZF unit. Something like that. 

Finally I’d prefer something small-ish. Besides driving the SL and my dad’s range rover a couple of times, I’m used to small cars from driving lessons and my current personal car is a 2004 Yaris. The SL size is probably the extreme but I wouldn’t mind it.

I have a Citroen C4 X 2024 1.2 Petrol. 

The car interior smells of raw gasoline/petrol when stationary or reversing, it comes through the air vents. Smelt around car (with engine running) and could smell it near drivers side front wheel and also under the bonnet around engine. 

Called breakdown service - no faults/leaks found, they couldn’t smell anything. 

Independent garage - no leaks found but they could smell the same smell as I can but couldn’t figure out where it was coming from. 

Main Citroen dealer - checked under warranty, no leaks or faults found and they couldn’t smell anything at all. Insisted that the smell was strong for me, they kept it a 2nd day - still no fault or smell found and was told car safe to drive. 

Just drove it back from the Citroen dealer and again have the same smell, I have no idea what else to do now or what it could be? Do I just need to keep running the vehicle to get rid of the smell? (think it has been stood for a couple months before I purchased it)

Questions, what cars were you buying, mileage, age and price? Cheap autos can be pretty bad value, and if you’re buying cars with dry clutches or wet clutches never serviced it would cause issues. 

Leasing is fine if you don’t mind putting down a few thousand up front and paying monthly. Tend to only have the car a year or two and then you need to source a deposit for another lease. Often more expensive than repairing cars, but you get a new car every couple years, servicing is handled etc so it’s a good peace of mind bit of motoring and I believe it’s financially better than a pcp. You have to watch out for your mileage limit though and any nicks you get you’ll pay for. 

PCP is similar tbh, just that it runs longer, and you have the option to buy the car at the end. Doesn’t include servicing etc so need to add that on top. 

PCH is pointless, it’s effectively a loan at a worse rate than you’d get a bank. If you consider this approach just get a bank loan and cash purchase. 

Then you have the bank loan option. Buy something 3-5 years old when it’s lost a lot of value but still modern enough to have everything you need. This is my approach, I like my car not being tied to finance and the lower monthly’s of paying a low apr loan. 

Or just buy a cheaper car in cash but do your research and try get it inspected. 

All are viable options. I will say though deals like pcp can become a cycle where each time you change the car your monthly’s tend to creep up as you’ve always got to “upgrade”, can get a bit trapped in them."

At first impressions I am keen on the Renault Megane and Kia Optima.

It will be used as a workhorse so I do have a few requirements/preferences as follows:

- Budget is up to £12k
- Capable of reliably driving 100 miles a day (majority of motorway with some semi-rural) 6 out of 7 days a week
- Can't lose or struggle for power when fully or heavily laden
- If the seats would go down flat that would be ideal but it isn't a necessity because estates have a very usable boot space anyway
- Ideally a manual gearbox
- No older than 2016

1ne7ibr,Help - Which Civic G10 should I buy?,"Good afternoon everyone,

I’ve been looking for a car for a while now, and the one that caught my attention in terms of brand, price, and looks is the Civic G10.

I’m really unsure because my budget is pretty flexible. My initial budget was between £5k and £10k. I don’t know if I should go for the cheapest option (even though it’s not the trim or model I actually want, the price is attractive) or spend more than double on the exact trim and model I’d prefer, which would stretch my budget but probably keep me satisfied, and with the 1.5 I’d likely keep the car for much longer.

Here are the options I’m considering:

* **2018 Civic 1.0 VTEC Turbo SR** – 83k miles, private seller, timing belt replaced in 2024 – **£6,250**
* **2019 Civic 1.5 VTEC Turbo Sport Plus** – 72k miles, Honda dealer – **£13,250**
* **Civic 1.5 VTEC Turbo Sport** (no sunroof) – 47k miles, Honda dealer – **£13,940**
* **Civic 1.5 VTEC Turbo GPF Sport Plus** – 73k miles, full Honda main dealer service history – **£12,400**

I’ve been searching for weeks and really need the car soon since I’ll be using it for commuting to work and weekend trips with my wife.

So, is the 1.0 engine in this generation really as bad as people say? Would it be a huge mistake to pick one up for around £6.2k, or is it going to give me endless headaches?  
I definitely prefer the 1.5 (180hp), but price obviously matters too.

Thanks a lot for your help!

Depends if 130HP is enough for you, but I wouldn't worry about the reliability of those. Personally, no issues from my side. I like ""spirited"" driving so at the end of my ownership I was a bit underwhelmed and considered some upgrades, though I didn't want to be forced into it like I was... So if you're like me I wouldn't consider 1.0, but if you just want a good car at a good price, then it should be great. 1.5 is just much more perky. Even though it's Honda, I'd still ensure good service history and maintenance. My only issue with the car was paint chips...

Wife and I want to avoid PCP/HP/loan for a new car right now so I have been keeping my eyes peeled for something older. Guy at work has been tasked with shifting his dads Q5 who was medically discharged from driving, and finally said yes to letting it go.

Car is a 63 plate Q5 with a 2.0 TDI 170 engine and 7-speed automatic. 78k, full leather, top spec inside and out - he was an options ticker. Basically it is a one owner from new with full history motor. Minor bump on the front bumper outside corner that needs a new plastic grille fitted, but otherwise straight and true - mine for £7k. It recently had a bunch spending on it to replace the adblue tank/lines so presuming that is a positive as know adblue crystallises, have asked to see the rest of the documents on hand.

We have a loan for our Q2 which is becoming increasingly too small with a baby. The plan is for me to take this and give the wife the Q5. Once the loan is settled I will probably go and buy her a CR-V or RAV4, so we only really need this to last us 2-3 years tops. Size/spec wise the Q5 seems pretty spot on for what we need right now.

We do live close to ULEZ which given it is Euro 5 will be chargeable, but we rarely go into the zone so could stomach the occasional fee. My wife also does fairly short journeys, 20 mile commute each way 3x weekly and local nursery/shopping runs... so I would need to schedule something more substantial once a month for the DPF? I have never owned a diesel so new territory for me.

Also I look after my cars, 5000 mile oil changes and I use a local VAG tech that keeps all my cars 100% so not really worried about routine maintenance as will have that covered. Mostly worried about any big surprises...

In December 2024 I booked an MOT and service, still on the service plan. I thought everything was fine, they gave me paperwork (which I should have realised was just an MOT certificate and no service record).

A few weeks after that, my car kept telling me a service and oil inspection was due - I called the dealer about it who told me not to worry, it’s just a glitch and if I bring my car into the garage they’ll update the car (I’d since moved house so I kept putting this off as the dealership was a bit of a drive away, another stupid mistake - although it would’ve been too late anyway as 2024 had passed). 

Moving onto the past week, I’m trying to sell the car and noticed I was missing the 2024 service record.

A high mileage car doesn't mean it's a bad car - What matters is the service history. A well maintained car with 200k miles on the car will be better than a car with no or a badly maintained service history that has 50k miles on the clock.

If it's more towards annoying then just keep hold of it. It's reliable and already at the bottom of its depreciation curve. 

If it's more towards the miserable scale then it's a necessity and the resale value is somewhat irrelevant. Just take the loss and jump into something that provides a quality of life increase.

Kind of irrelevant if the engines go easily past 300k miles if every year to spend £3k on random ancillary items.
