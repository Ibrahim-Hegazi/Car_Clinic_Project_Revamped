1mvvl23,Grand Cherokee Jeep 2014. Engine light,It might matter about the mileage. It has 178k miles but is still in good condition. When I'm in park my car steadly shakes and the check engine light turned on once. But shakes whenever i turn on my car and ofc its in park it shakes until i start moving. But now I just started driving and a flashing check engine light came on. Its currently really hot so i wasn't sure if that was the issue? Because when i turned it off and back on it shook again. And i waited again to turn it on and it was okay to drive and the light didnt come back on. I did take it easy and slow with acceleration and stuff like that. Im just wondering what's going on is anyone has a slight guess? I will be going to the mechanic i just need to get ahold of them tomorrow morning. Im just curious in if anyone has a slight guess in what's going on before I go in. Cause the light does go away.

1mvvhe4,2014 Kia Soul-Many Issues,"I have a 2014 Kia Soul and in the last two years it has cost me a boatload of money. My current issue is a check engine light and an obvious odor coming from my car. I ran the codes and the photos are attached, it says there are two codes but then there's four things that come up and I honestly don't know what that means. Anyway, in December of 2023 my check engine light was on and I knew it was my catalytic converter but I was not able to fix it at the time and was still driving it until my car was unable to go above 20 mph and I had the catalytic converter replaced out of Jack Williams that I just happened to pull into. Since then, my check engine light has come on and turned off multiple times, but lately it has come on and stayed on. With the codes attached showing, at first it just said I had a very small emission leak and now it says that the catalytic converter is operating below efficiency. Recently, my car has been blowing out blueish- black smoke every once in awhile when I accelerate, usually after I get off the highway and then stop somewhere and then Accelerate from the stop sign. I just took my car in for an oil change and now the smoke seems to be more frequent and looks to be white. I know that my car Burns oil but now I'm concerned about a head gasket issue and coolant leaking into the engine. My plan was to take it back to Jack Williams and see if hopefully my catalytic converter can be replaced under the 5-year warranty, otherwise I'm fudged as I cannot afford a new car and in May I had to get a whole new suspension and all new brakes and rotors and calipers which cost me $3,500 in addition to new spark plugs, the new cat and brake lines i have had done in the last 2 years which total up to a few more thousand. I have replaced the engine air filter and the gas cap myself and I got oxygen sensors that I'm hoping my dad will help me replace. Is there a reason why the smoke would have changed from Blue to Black within a day since I got my oil changed?

From what I have read, the engine is defective. It burns excess oil which then damages the catalytic converter. Folks have had their engine replaced, but it is the same defective engine so it keeps harming the catalytic converter. I read about two people who had their engines changed twice under warranty. 

 I ran a $20.00 bottle of catalytic converter cleaner and the code disappeared and I just replaced the PCV valve, spark plugs,  ignition coils and air filter. I now have the upstream oxygen sensor throwing a code so I am going to replace both the upstream and downstream sensors.

Kia's engines on the Soul are defective and the car has to be babied in order for them to last. Your car was subject to a class action settlement.

1mvvg1u,Minivan needs new alternator. What are my options?,"My 2005 Chevrolet Uplander has cranking problems. A year ago It stopped running and I had it towed to a shop. They replaced the starter for $441 ($224 part and $145 for 1.5 hrs labor). Autozone (not my mechanic) said my battery needed replacing, but I didn't do anything about it since fixing the starter fixed the problem.

A year later, my car stopped running unless I jumped it. I replaced the battery (a low end Econocraft from Autozone with 3 month warranty).

2 months after that now, my car dies and needs jumps again. Took it to AutoZone to test it and they said the battery is still fine, but the alternator needs to be replaced.

I called my usual mechanic for a ballpark estimate of the alternator replacement, and he said $200 for the part (sometimes a little less) and 3-4 hours of labor for $450, so $650 altogether. I like supporting this mechanic because they've been so honest and good to me about wiggle room with costs, but that's more money than I was anticipating, and I've been in a long struggle with finances.

I cleaned it and it hasn’t changed. Today, I drove it to work and back (about 20 miles total), praying it doesn’t break on me, but it didn’t change.

1mvr9kf,Timing Chain Failure Dispute,"Hi all,

I’d really like some outside opinions on this situation I’m in.

I bought a 2013 VW Golf Cabriolet 1.4 TSI (petrol) on hire purchase a few months ago. The car came with a full service history and was described as being well maintained. About six weeks later, at around 121,000 miles, the timing chain catastrophically failed, leading to complete engine seizure.

The finance company and dealership are both calling this “wear and tear,” but I’m not convinced. My understanding is:

* Timing belts have fixed replacement intervals, but timing chains are marketed as lifetime *components* that shouldn’t need replacing under normal conditions.
* Most modern petrol engines are expected to last \~150k–200k miles when properly maintained.
* Timing chain failures are usually preceded by rattling/noise or diagnostic codes, but my car showed none of these signs before suddenly failing.

To me, it feels unreasonable to dismiss this as simple wear and tear, especially given the vehicle’s supposed full maintenance history. I’d expect “wear and tear” to cover things like brakes, clutches, tyres, etc. — not the catastrophic failure of a “lifetime” component shortly after purchase.

So my question is:

Do you think it’s fair to classify a timing chain failure at 120k miles on a well-maintained car as normal wear and tear, or does this sound more like an underlying defect that the dealer/finance company should take responsibility for?

Bare in mind neither the dealership nor my finance company have actually taken the engine apart for a full investigation, they just brushed it of based on the high mileage.

The previous owner said they had a mobile mechanic come look at it and said it needed a whole new transmission. The engine started and ran like a top, I could shift into all the gears easily, but there was nothing when you let the clutch out. The rpm didn't even dip. The old clutch was completely worn out on one said and the other had been 1 and 2 mm of material left. The clutch pedal was hanging pretty low as well. When I drained the gear oil out of the trans it didn't have any big chunks of metal that would indicate broken gears/teeth. It definitely had a bit of very fine metallic powder in the fluid but another friend of mine said that was to be expected at 169k miles of it was the original fluid. 

I replaced the clutch, throw out bearing, pressure plate, and flywheel but when I tested it out the engine couldn't maintain idle and would surge up to as much as 2k rpm and then bog down even with the clutch fully depressed. Also, I couldn't get it into first gear while second and third just grind. I was testing this while the front was still up on jackstands and noticed the front rotors trying to turn forward even with the clutch in. I thought maybe one of the cylinders is bad and it can't fully disengage. I replaced and blead both of them but I still have similar issues. It will go into reverse if I really push on the shifter but the forward gears are impossible to get into. 

Do I need to adjust my clutch pedal to allow for more travel to get it fully disengage or is the grinding just a sign of needing a rebuild/new transmission? I just want to know that it will fix the issue before I throw more money/parts at it.

Check the timing when TEN is jumped to GND and the engine is at operating temp and with no extra electrical/accessories turned on, so check the timing when the cooling fan shuts off. You'll want a timing light to accurately set idle speed anyways since the tach doesn't really give you much of an idea of the actual speed due to its markings (or lack thereof). On the Miata due to its ignition design it will show twice the speed it's actually at. So if it shows 1700 RPM the idle speed is actually 850 RPM and would be correct.

But idle speed on these cars should jump up to about 1000 RPM when the AC compressor is running. Not decrease.

Either way. Make sure you checked and adjusted idle speed correctly first and then go from there."

So I pryed them back and made a 2x4 pad that distributed the weight evenly and worked fine, but where am I supposed to place the jack stands if the lift point is occupied by the floor jack? 

I am trying to replace the rear shocks and springs. Should I just lift from the center of the axle, and put the jack stands under both sides so that both sides are off the ground? Is there pros and cons of lifting the entire rear vs just one side? Why do manufacturers not give you a good spot to lift with the floor jack??

When I first got the car, the bottom of the rad support was pushed back, along with a few other dents and dings under the passenger side. 

I was able to push the rad support close to the proper location with the Harbor Freight body repair kit. 

There does not ""appear"" to be main frame damage, however I'm quite sure the front subframe has been pushed back. I came to this conclusion after discovering the radius rod bushing was missing the OEM washer on the passenger side, with the wheel being centered in the well. Installing said washer pushes the wheel back in the well. 

There is also evidence via the transmission mount being shifted towards the back, on the frame part of the mount. 

The rad support is definitely pushed down on the passenger side, which is quite obvious with the hood and grille gap on the passenger side. 

So now I'm looking to see if anyone locally in central Florida has a recommendation on either a shop they've gone to, or a shop they have heard mentioned positively.

The vehicle is a 2011 Nissan Versa S 1.8L Hatchback. 4 Speed Automatic.

Over the last few weeks, i've been getting hit with what I could only describe as a light headed-toxic noxious-like smell. 

It really only happens when I have my windows down at a full stop. Even when I'm in a parking lot. Usually happens after about 45 minutes of driving or after noon once it's hot out.

I've ruled out carbon monoxide with a CO detector, and it doesn't quite smell like coolant as I've dripped coolant onto my hot manifold and took a sniff to see if it was similar. Unless coolant can get super heated elsewhere and smell even more intense? 

I smell it very slightly every now and then with the windows up and my a/c on, but just barely. But if the windows are down and I'm stopped, it gets so bad I have to get out of the car because it feels like it's asphyxiating me.

It's not a burnt rubber or plastic smell either. Also smells far different than that white smoke of doom after a blown head gasket. I also purged a little refrigerant into a rag and smelt it, and it doesn't smell the same. Unless refrigerant smells different after being heated in the system?

Any ideas? It's got my mechanic and I baffled. Tell me where I should do smell tests!

1mvjsot,Should I retrofit A/C on my 2016 Toyota Auris or look for alternatives?,"Hi all,

About a year ago I bought a 2016 Toyota Auris (second hand, no options) for €11k with just 36k km. It’s been a solid buy and I plan to keep it until \~250k km or until it breaks down. Over time I’ve added cruise control, a new radio, and other small upgrades — I like improving it bit by bit.

Now with the recent heat levels going high here in Belgium, I’ve realized A/C would make a big difference. I got a quote for a retrofit: **€3.5k + VAT**, which feels very steep.

So here are the options I see:

* **Retrofit A/C** → expensive, but maybe worth it if I’m keeping the car long term.
* **Trade up** → newer car with factory A/C, but that probably means spending another €7–10k on top of what mine is worth.
* **DIY install** → I’m curious, but I’m guessing it’s not realistic without pro tools/experience.
* **Alternatives** → since the heat only lasts 2–3 months, maybe portable cooling or other seasonal solutions could be enough.

**TL;DR:**  
2016 Auris, no A/C. Retrofit = €3.5k+VAT. Options: retrofit, trade up, DIY (unlikely), or seasonal workarounds. What would you do?

Idk where to start so about two and half months ago. The truck just stopped mid-drive, and I figured out it was the fuel pump. I replaced that. It started, no problems working great, in fact, better than it had in the last 10 years.

A couple of days later, the battery died on me, replaced that.

A week later, the belt snapped, replaced that.

Another week later, the water pump took a dump on me. I let the truck sit for about 3 weeks. I didn’t turn it on or do anything with it until today. I replaced the water pump and quadruple-checked everything.

Got in the truck to turn it on to test the pump and check for leaks, and the engine wouldn’t start… (not me getting raged at this point)

The truck has power, when I turn the key to “on” or ignite the engine, it cranks, and wants to turn over and start, but won’t. I checked all the fuses and all the relays related to gas. Everything good.

So I took the air filter off, and put some (like a shot glass worth of) gas in the Throttle body/ carburetor, it started and ran for about 45 seconds. I put a little more and floored the gas pedal in hopes of drawing the fuel in. It didn't work. I also checked my gas cap, it seems to seal just fine, but when I open it, I don't hear the release of pressure, not sure if that matters. After I did that, I tried to start it again, and this time it started and ran for a little longer, but shut right off and would not restart.

1mvqthn,Any insights on my car failing to brake?,"Hi Reddit Users,

So about an hour ago I went to go to the store and as I was driving I came up to a stop sign. I began to brake but my car continued to move, basically going in and out of braking as if there was ice on the ground while trying to do so. It felt like it was jolting almost and the breaks or something were giving out. (to note: I was not going at a high speed or stopping last second either). Thankfully there were no cars in front of me so I did not hit anybody but by the time my car got to a full stop, I was already passed the stop sign and in the middle of the road. (i know i should've used my emergency breaks or something along those lines but i was in panic mode and couldn't think in time).

I was able to get to the store whilst driving at sloth speed (it was right across from the stop sign) and parked in a lot. There were no other problems driving home but considering I was driving so slow (+ used four-way blinkers), I don't know how my car would react again driving at a normal speed. I will be getting it checked out soon but wanted some insight on the issue itself and if anybody has any ideas on it.

Also to note: I got my car inspected a few months ago and the guy told me I am due for new brakes around summer time but I have not heard any squeaky noises from them or had any other issues that would let me know im due for new ones, so I was completely thrown off-guard.

1mvqowi,Insights on my car failing to brake!,"Hi Reddit Users,

So about an hour ago I went to go to the store and as I was driving I came up to a stop sign. I began to brake but my car continued to move, basically going in and out of braking as if there was ice on the ground while trying to do so. It felt like it was jolting almost and the breaks or something were giving out. (to note: I was not going at a high speed or stopping last second either). Thankfully there were no cars in front of me so I did not hit anybody but by the time my car got to a full stop, I was already passed the stop sign and in the middle of the road. (i know i should've used my emergency breaks or something along those lines but i was in panic mode and couldn't think in time).

I was able to get to the store whilst driving at sloth speed (it was right across from the stop sign) and parked in a lot. There were no other problems driving home but considering I was driving so slow (+ used four-way blinkers), I don't know how my car would react again driving at a normal speed. I will be getting it checked out soon but wanted some insight on the issue itself and if anybody has any ideas on it.

Also to note: I got my car inspected a few months ago and the guy told me I am due for new brakes around summer time but I have not heard any squeaky noises from them or had any other issues that would let me know im due for new ones, so I was completely thrown off-guard. Please let me know if anyone has any input!

If it constantly blew warm air out of the vents, I'd say the system is low on refrigerant, likely due to a leak. It would need to be inspected and the remaining charge removed from the system and weighed/compared to how much is supposed to be in the system. 

 If it works sometimes and blows nice cold air when it does, but cuts out if you step on the gas, the problem could be the clutch on the front of the compressor. Sometimes the air gap of the clutch widens from wear and the magnetic coil can no longer engage the clutch to the compressor because the gap is too large. 

If the compressor is easy to observe, you could verify this by checking if the front of the compressor is spinning when the AC is on (it should spin and stop normally), if it doesn't spin at all but start to spin when tapped with something, this is likely the problem. I will say that tapping on the clutch near spinning pulleys and belt is very dangerous and should only be done by a professional.

The fix for adjusting the clutch air gap on the compressor usually involves removing the bolt in the middle of the clutch hub so the hub can be removed, then some shim washers can be removed from behind it to close up the gap. Hope this is helpful somehow!"
1mvtwq5,Engine coolant overheating: Toyota Venza 2015,"To preface, i’m a dumb girl who knows virtually nothing about cars. 

Last week, while waiting in the school drop off line, the engine coolant overheating light came on and my meter was in the red. I blasted the AC and took it in because I needed an oil change anyway. I had no coolant so they put that in too. 
I had to drive careful, not accelerate too much, but anytime I was stopped the meter would rise again. 

Today, at a long red light, it happened again. I immediately blasted the AC, the light turned off, and the meter regulated and did not move again anytime I accelerated or stopped. 

Yes I’ve made an appointment with toyota. My car is at 160,000 miles. Any idea of what happened?

1. Blasting the AC will make the car run hotter.  Blasting the HEAT will help the engine cool off.  
1. When the car is cool, look at both the coolant and the oil and tell us what you see.  Does the coolant have a rainbow sheen?  Does it look milky?  Same with the oil.  What color is the oil on the dipstick.  But again, wait until the car cools off.  
1. If the AC is helping the car run better, the question remains: where does the coolant go?  The fact that it's not staying in your engine is never a good sign.  Your best hope is that you have a cracked hose.  Otherwise, it could be a cracked radiator, or worse."

Could the crud be coolant? The most recent work I had done to my car was that I had an oil change in April and also in May I had to have the idle air control valve replaced and repair a leaking coolant gasket on the throttle body. The leak was an interior leak, but the mechanic had to remove a couple of coolant hoses to remove the throttle body and the coolant could have spilled onto the hose, but I'm not sure if coolant can create black crud like that.",2,1755674436.0,3,autorepair,1755804937,2025-08-20 07:20:36,2025-08-21 19:35:37,None (Score: 1): [deleted]

Earlier today my Tahoe started not shifting when accelerating. When I got home I checked the transmission fluid and it was empty. It hadn't been low before. I put in some more and it just leaked right out. I can see where it's dripping from, the lower transmission cooler line. (though I'll add a pic too for confirmation). Is this something I can replace myself? No, I'm not very experienced at auto repair but I've done oil changes, brake pads and rotor changes, installed stereos, changed fuses, installed a new radiator, and a a few hoses and pipe replacements in a different car.

After more googling and video watching I know for certain that replacing the line is NOT something I can do. Unfortunately it's also not something I can afford, and unless I can get the Tahoe working so I can go to work and medical appts, I'll never be able to afford it. So... New question.

I was able to push the pipe back in and felt a click. It felt a lot more solid after that and it didn't seem to be leaking. Overnight there was a single drip spot. I filled up the fluid to, I think, the right spot and didn't a short run around the block. It held fine and shifted perfect! So I took it for a little longer test drive. First drive was about 3/4 miles. This was about 1 1/4 miles. In the last quarter mile it started not shifting again and, sure enough, the pipe had popped off. I got her home (just let her cruise because I have no one to tow her) and now here I am again.

I NEED her to work long enough for me to save the money. By the middle of October I should be ready to go. ( well I suppose that actually depends on how much it cost to have somebody replace that if somebody could give me an estimate that would be delightful). So my new question now is:

Is there anything I can do to bandaid that pipe and make it stay on for a couple months so I don't lose my job? Something that won't then also make the replacement a lot more expensive (a friend suggested I have a welder weld the pipe to the radiator... I'm thinking... Not a good idea unless we want to pay a lot more to eventually have it repaired.) 

Tl;dr: Bottom line question : how can I bandaid this to make it work good for a couple months. I am disabled and chronically ill, I have many doctors appointments. Most of which are several hours away, and I can't miss them. I just need her to work so I can remain alive while I save up and actually fix her."

I haven’t had any problems really, I did just replace the mass airflow sensor but that was easy. 

This last Saturday I got gas at Costco, drove about 100 feet and the engine sputtered and cut out. I double checked that it wasn’t diesel lol, it wasn’t but it was Costco regular. I filed an incident report with Costco and all that.

I push it into a spot and go do my Costco run. It cranks up after but does after a quarter mile. I happen to die next to a shop so I push it out of the road into there. 

The mechanic tells me to get Sea foam and see if that helps, in case water or other shit was in the gas. 

It helped me drive home, about 8 miles, but the car stopped again when I got home so it’s at best, unreliable right now.

I ran a reader on it and got these codes. Some of them had to be there before cause I don’t see how they’re related but the check engine didn’t come on until I was on the way home.

I’m going to get an estimate/diagnostic to see what Costco will pay for, but I’m weighing my options, since I may be better off doing it myself. I’d consider myself of intermediate ability, mechanically. 


So the long and short of this TLDR: how would yall prioritize these codes? I have Virginia inspections coming up in September so it’ll all have to get done but I have a feeling even if I do the work myself this is gonna cost an arm and a leg.

Option 1: Fix it and drive it into the ground (likely 1–2 more years, then scrap).
Option 2: Sell now (for very little) and buy something with my 10-15k budget

Mechanic says even with the $1,300 repair, I’d still come out ahead compared to car payments. Also, my mileage will go down in a few years once I stop taking long-distance jobs. Maybe it makes more sense to put the heavy mileage on my Civic instead of burning it on a newer car.

Also while I'm here do ya'll find it easier to remove the engine for those internal water pumps or just work around the car?

I have a Nissan Altima 2013, 160,000km. I began having issues with my car struggling to start since last winter in Dec. I got it checked out and was told I needed to replace my spark plugs. When I did that the mechanic said that my valve cover gasket was bad and there was oil spraying all over the place basically when he changed the plugs. He said to get it replaced when the weather was warmer, so I did it a couple months later. Things were going ok for a little bit. Fast forward to now over the last few weeks my car has been struggling to start again. Every time I click it on it feels weaker and weaker. Yesterday had an incident where it didn't start.

1mvuit5,Advice on how to deal with a mechanic after a poor job on tires.,"Hi, any help would be greatly appreciated. I have a 2019 Honda civic and after putting 70,000 miles on it I decided to get new tires (you’d be surprised how much tread was still on them). I called a mechanic who I’ve used before (not for tires) but who’s had a shop for several years and has always done good work for me and when he couldn’t complete one job he was up front and honest that he couldn’t. I asked him 4 four new standard A/S tires. We schedule an appointment for this morning. I take it there he got behind and let me know that it may take longer than an hour to install. So I said no problem went to work until he texted me and came back to pick up my car.

I was charged $515 for the tires and $75 for an oil change. I live in a rural area so the price on those is fairly average. I drive off and everything seems fine until i get to about 50, 60 mph and I notice my car shakes/vibrates intermittently. My civic has never done this and has by far been the smoothest vehicle I’ve ever had. The shaking wasn’t bad enough to where I felt unsafe necessarily but enough to know that something wasn’t quite right. I took the car back to the mechanic and told him the issue and he said “that’s normal, it’s typical for that type of material until it gets worn in. Give it a few days and come back if it doesn’t get better” I’m not a car guy by any means so I have no idea if he meant the tire as the material or the lugnuts/etc.

I said okay drove off and couldn’t get it off my mind that something was wrong. So after googling asking around the consensus seem to be they weren’t balanced. No one had ever heard about the material thing he was referring to. 

So I took it upon myself to go to Walmart and just have them rebalance it themselves. I told Walmart the situation and neither of the guys working on the car could tell if they actually had a different balance on the tires than the mechanic did but they did find the PSI on 2 tires was over 50psi (32 is recommended for my car). Walmart charged me $60 for the lifetime balance and rotation of the tires or $52 for one time. So I took the $60 bc might as well since I will have to rotate the tires plenty of times anyway. 

My issue is my mechanic didn’t take me seriously imo. He didn’t bother to check anything, ask more questions, or test drive the car. My question is how do I handle this with the mechanic? Do I just eat the cost and move on? Ask him if there’s a solution to appease us both. 

I’m open to all arguments on the one hand he messed up with the PSI. However he would have corrected the issue if I would’ve waited likely free of charge. However, I feel if I brought u the vehicle back and offered u a chance to at least check the issue and u decline I should be able to address the issue with another business in a reasonable manner. Thank you.

Short answer-- yes. You can express your displeasure and ask for $ (That seems like the only solution you want?), and maybe he will agree. 

Longer answer, this does not make sense ""neither of the guys working on the car could tell if they actually had a different balance on the tires than the mechanic did"" because it involves using a specialized machine to identify any imbalances in the tire and wheel assembly and then adding weights to counteract those imbalances. If they added weights, they did something, and that something should have been done by the original shop. If they didn't, they just aired you to the correct pressure and made $100. While in this case, the original shop should have aired your tires correctly, I am surprised you do not have a $2 pencil air pressure guage to check your tire pressure (or most modern cars have TPMS built in-- I assume you do not).

They don’t give a shit about best practices anymore, they make up their own.

I'm beginning to suspect fuel delivery issues, as the readings from the MAP sensor seem to be normal, and I can not find any vacuum leaks (although I supposed a stuck EGR valve, EVAP purge or faulty brake booster could be the case here, but I would imagine I would be able to easily get the codes to trigger again after clearing, and I can't seem to reliably find a driving situation where the codes will trigger). Symptoms are slow cranking, a rattling type noise that is progressively louder as the engine load increases that I think is coming from driver side, and a lack of power through the rev range (when I stomp on it the car downshifts and goes through the rev range, but doesn't do a whole lot of accelerating). Any help in diagnosing this would be super helpful. 

The freeze data does not show the b1s1 voltage/lambda values, but when I was reading live data the lambda would fluctuate between 1 and 1.2 while under load and would normalize to .85-.95 after the engine load decreased. The fuel trims both short and long term were within +/- 10% under light load and idle but shot to well over 20% under heavy load. The voltage read anywhere between 2.3 and 2.9 on b1s1, and would briefly go all the way up to 5 volts when I am totally off the gas and coasting.  There seems to be a bit of bluing on the exhaust after the first cat which I've never really seen before and would assume is from the cat/exhaust getting too hot, but I would imagine that would be occuring in a rich condition.

I’m unfamiliar with those 2.x Volt oxygen sensor values.  You might be looking at mA or the heaters or something.   Sensor signal is 0-1V. Closer to 0 is lean, closer to 1 is rich.   Ignore the freeze frame bc it’s not showing a lean condition.    Monitor B1S2 (downstream) live while holding throttle in park.   If it’s voltage bottoms out, it’s fuel delivery.  

The evap could do that (stuck open purge valve) but you should get a evap leak code along with it, unless this car is always running on only a few gallons of gas.  Evap codes won’t set if tank is consistently below 25%.   Troubleshoot for that, cap off purge valve where it attaches to intake, cap on the intake side, n see if it affects fuel trims."

1mvt2sl,Water intrusion at door speaker behind door panel,"Hello. I come in search of knowledge. I and the body shop I went to are stumped.

Car is a 2014 Chevy SS, stock, no accidents.

My car is parked outside near trees and is used maybe once per week.

3 of my 4 doors (all but driver door) recently filled with water after a rain storm due to clogged drain holes. This led to a massive water intrusion into the cabin.

Door drains were unclogged and gallons came out. Carpet wet vac'd and was lifted and dried and the jute is pending replacement.

However I'm now still getting a relatively minor water intrusion from the same 3 doors every time it rains. Water drips in one spot from behind the door panel down onto the bottom weatherstripping then overflows and runs into the cabin.

I thought it might be the vapor barrier but actually after removing the door panel and spraying the windows from the outside, the intrusion is originating where the speaker is mounted to the door. Large volumes drip from between the metal speaker mounting pate and the door itself.

It's like there should be a gasket there, but there isn't one.

I haven't pulled the panels from the other doors yet, but I'm reasonably certain that it's going to be the same.

I'm trying to understand how and why the speakers would all have started persistently leaking now. The same 3 doors that filled with water are the ones that currently leak so that can't be coincidental, the doors filling had to lead to the speaker leaking somehow.

[This is a video of the leak after the body shop attempted to seal it with something.](https://streamable.com/d5rovz) It used to pour in a stream, but now is down to a persistent drip.

Trying to figure out how it would have started, and now how to stop it.

Getting a look at behind the speaker from GM parts website, it looks like there's some type of foam cowl on the rear of it that would form part of the seal. Best guess is this foam failed after the doors filled with water? https://i.imgur.com/M2MJFRp.png And if so not sure what to do about it.

1mvftht,What jobs have you left the mechanic field for?,"Those of you that are mechanics or in blue collar work and have gotten out, what do you do now? 

I'm a mechanic and I have been for most of my life. I've worked flat - rate in the dealerships. I've worked for a smaller shop on vehicles. I worked for a forklift company as a road tech and for the last 3 years I've been a rental equipment mechanic for construction equipment, aerial lifts, excavators, skid steers, forklifts, and small tool like chainsaws, screeds, pole saw, small and large generators etc. I enjoy diagnostics and fixing stuff and it's also what I do with any free time I have (project cars/bikes or friends and family repairs) which, isn't much now that I'm a new dad. However I absolutely hate the hours that mechanics must work. I don't want to work overtime. (Being offered as an option is fine but I don't want to work mandatory overtime) I don't want to work Saturdays or Sundays or holidays. I also very much dislike how mechanics and a lot of blue collar workers are treated. I personally spent a lot of time trying to learn and understand diagnostics and electrical especially, but also correctly fixing and diagnosing things the first time and all I have gained from my extra effort is extra work. I've noticed this at most places I've worked and for some reason mechanics are the 'go to' for picking up other people's jobs too.  I've applied and interviewed around 4-5 times (in the same field) within the last 3 years of my current job and I've also applied internally to a service manager position and expressed interest in service manager or maybe a field tech or a technician teacher. We don't really have field techs in this company or teachers and it seems service manager isn't going to be an option because I've proven myself too much as a tech. I absolutely despise my job. Not a fan of a majority of the people I work with but I try to be polite and respectful as I do have to work with them. As of right now I'm required to work a few overtime shifts and every third week we have to work a 'late shift' which changes our hours and when we get to go home. There's also more mandatory overtime on the third week. The reason they require this is because they refuse to hire enough people to do the job that requires someone to be there all the time so they disperse it amongst mechanics. (This is not mechanic related at all.) We also work a minimum of 1 Saturday a month for only 3 hours and that is quickly changing to more than 1 because of turnover and other changes in the company. 
Also, being a mechanic destroys your body. Early arthritis and other often pains. You would think such a mentally and physically demanding job that requires you to own several thousands of dollars in tools would get ya a break somewhere. 

So what kind of job should I look for? Whenever I have time to search I come up blank. I'll scroll forever, just reading different openings, hoping for some inspiration on ideas for jobs to look for. Some apps like indeed just try to match you with jobs that are similar to what I already do. I don't hate being a mechanic but I've been to enough jobs to know that unfortunately this is just the standard of how a mechanic will be treated, the hours they will work, and how they will be paid. I have recently found that I enjoy helping other mechanics and friends diagnose and fix and helping them with electrical schematics and such. Being a new father, I don't want to miss out on seeing my son grow up and being there for all the milestones/events. I've come to realize that I've let my occupation negatively affect my overall life and my relationships with others and I think it's time for a change. Are there jobs out there that can use our skills but in a different manner? Or is there a more creative idea of another occupation that people like us may enjoy that doesn't have the baggage that comes with being a mechanic?

1. Developed a terrible shudder (mostly at idle, though occasionally at speed) that eventually threw a misfire code. Diagnosed as bad coil pack, replaced and replaced all plugs as well at that time (as well as filters)

2. About a month later CEL came on with no noticable symptoms. Lean fuel mixture codes (P0171 and P2270), diagnosed as PCV valve failure. Replaced valve cover with integrated PCV.

3.  CEL returned with same codes and now U0401:71 (invalid data from engine/power train control, possibly completely unrelated?). All codes show passed for last test and this ignition cycle. Replaced downstream O2 sensor.

The CEL hasn't come back after replacing O2 sensor and clearing codes, but that was just a few days ago and to be blunt I'm assuming it will come back, O2 was just a relatively cheap and easy fix. If it does return, I've done some research and I think there are a few things I should check:

1. If there is a visible rubber nipple (check valve I guess) in the intake manifold. If gone, intake manifold may be needed.

2. Remove electrical connector and adjacent hose from purge valve. If suction is felt when car is running, replace purge valve.

3. Inspect MAF sensor (may just replace regardless because it's an easy and relatively cheap fix)

Am I on the right track? Unfortunately I live in an apartment in NYC so doing much work myself is difficult. Just don't have the means to do a smoke test or any more sophisticated tests. Any common failure point connections or hoses I should check? Thanks so much.

Yesterday, my 2005 Toyota Corolla LE with an automatic transmission decided it wouldn’t start. I’d turn the key and get absolutely nothing—no crank, no odd noises, just silence. Because the lights and radio still worked, I didn’t think the battery was dead. Still, I tried a jump, just in case. Nothing.

A little research pointed to a common culprit on this car—an aging starter relay. I picked up a new one, swapped it in, and… still nothing.

Figuring it had to be an electrical issue in the starter circuit, I went through the fuses one by one. None were blown. At that point I suspected the starter motor or solenoid, so I tried the old screwdriver jump across the solenoid posts. Nothing—not even a spark—which made me think the starter wasn’t getting power at all.

I started working backward. With a multimeter on the starter’s B post, I expected to see 12 volts. The meter showed nothing. That post should always be energized, so I was baffled.

I ran a separate wire from the battery’s positive terminal to the starter and tried the key again. Nothing. But now that I knew the starter had a constant 12 volts, I tried jumping the posts again. This time, the starter spun immediately. I hurried back to the driver’s seat, turned the key, and the car started right up.

Assuming the new cable was the fix, I removed it to confirm. With everything back as it was before, I turned the key again—and the car started right away. I’m completely perplexed as to why it’s working fine now.",1,1755663354.0,2,AskMechanics,1755804937,2025-08-20 04:15:54,2025-08-21 19:35:37,"OneleggedPeter (Score: 3): You likely have a dead spot in the starter.

Was pretty obvious they'd just replaced the boot because the rubber on the drivers side was stiff and old and the passenger side was new and pliable. Also they'd messed up the axle nuts lol


They're definitely not meant to be clicking at any rate so I'd probably replace it if you can't track down any other source of the noise."

I’m hoping someone here can point me in the right direction. While removing the throttle body on my 2012 Hyundai Santa Fe 3.5L V6, my friend accidentally broke this quick-connect fitting on the coolant line

Here are a bunch of photos of the broken connector and where it connects near the throttle body. I’m having a hard time figuring out the exact part number or a universal replacement that will fit securely.

From my research which may be incorrect because I'm not car savy It’s the coolant line quick-connect fitting that locks into the throttle body.

Hyundai seems to sell it only as part of the hose not with the connect I need. 28912-3C300

If there’s a Dorman, Gates, or other universal quick-connect that actually works for Hyundai/Kia 3/8""/10mm size, I’d happily go that route instead.

You can open the bonnet and check your brake fluid level. I don't recommend topping it up though as it's up to them to sort the car.

Also, take photos, then rinse off any brake fluid which might be on your paintwork as it will eat through the paint. This includes your wheel.

Someone else can chime in on whether you do indeed have a hydraulic clutch (opposed to a cable) but if you do, then 2+2=4, especially with the fluid you've found on the floor.

ETA, regardless, just do yourself and other road users a favour and check your brake fluid before driving it again. No idea of your skills or experience but a courteous search should give you an idea on how to check.

My friend has a 218i which he’s modded and mapped a bit to push 200ish bhp but it’s blown up.

This isn’t certain but that’s the only thing we can think of. No garages wanted it and the ones that did kept making up excuses on why they’re taking so long to even look at it.

But as far as I know the 230i is relatively uncommon, so finding a well maintained 220i and having it mapped by someone who knows what they're doing might be the way to go.

However as a disclaimer there's always maintenance to be done with BMWs whether they're mapped or not.

Car is a 2006 Mondeo 2.2 diesel. Has been running fine for a good while with no obvious signs of any incoming doom.

Today during my commute I got hit with random juddering. This was followed by smoke out the back end, loss of power & then the car just cut out & wont start at all.

Breakdown fella plugged his reader in & it returned the same code my cheap bluetooth one did - P0251 as well as P1211. He said if he had to take a stab at it then it'd be the fuel pump.

He ran some live data off his gizmo & it said the car was building fuel pressure (think the number came back as about 166000).

What I'm wanting to know is how likely it is that I've actually caused this or whether it was something that was probably going to happen anyway & the timing of it is just bad in that it seems like I may have caused it but probably haven't.

I put some of the Millers diesel additive in: [https://www.halfords.com/motoring/engine-oils-and-fluids/fuel-and-oil-additives/millers-diesel-power-ecomax-500ml-811125.html](https://www.halfords.com/motoring/engine-oils-and-fluids/fuel-and-oil-additives/millers-diesel-power-ecomax-500ml-811125.html)

Except I read online about how if it's not had it for some time then put 2x dose in, so that's what I did. I've done this previously when I last used it years ago - no problem then.

It then came time to fuel up the car again & so I added more of this stuff, except the tank hadn't drained fully. I'd used maybe 1/2 tank of juice to perhaps 3/4 so a very very rough estimate is instead of 1x dose to 50ltrs I used probably 3-4 dose to say 75ltrs (approx.)

My car has been pretty poor on fuel ever since I bought it 5 years ago - I get 40-43 mpg on a good day & I don't even drive like an idiot. On this particular tank full I was averaging 38mpg which was unusually low. I had it in at a garage last week & so the mpg dropped a few & I've since got that back up to 38 but it's still off the 40-43 that I'd normally be getting at this time of the year.

However I asked if my four years NCD counts in the web chat when technically it’s three days early, and they seem to think it can only be relevant to one car/policy at a time? Surely the driver incurs the NCD?

I feel I’m really stuck between a rock and a hard place. Can I just take a policy then submit proof of 4  years no claims after 26th if requested, can I claim 3 years NCD straight away or am I basically fucked due to bureaucracy and I should have known better?

For reference, it’s a BMW 8 Series. The stock sizes are:

* Rear: 275/30R20

My question is: can I run 245/40R20 and 275/35R20 instead? Would that cause any issues, or is it better to stick with the original sizes?

The reason I ask is because I’ve found Michelin Pilot Sport 4 Zero Pressure at the same price as PS4S, but they only seem to come with the taller sidewall. If that won’t work properly, I’ll just go with the standard PS4S or Continental SportContact 7.

Also, does anyone here have experience with the Continental SportContact 7? I’ve been running PS4S and really like how they perform consistently all year round, right up until the end of their life. How do the Continentals compare, especially in the rain? Do they stay good through mid-life to the end, or do they drop off quickly? And are they a solid all-year option here in the UK?

The car will be owned by a finance company (the people you pay your monthly payment to).

The process is that you ask for a settlement figure from the finance company - that'll usually be valid for a set amount of time, like 28 days. You then advertise the car for sale, stating that finance will be settled as part of the deal.

Anyone purchasing the car should then pay the settlement figure directly to the finance company and give you any remainder.

So, let's say you have a settlement figure of £7,000.

You advertise and agree to sell the car for £8,000.

I found this adorable 2010 nissan mirca tekna for about 1800, it has a lot of millage at 98,410 BUT I really love the car. My parents have offered to buy me the car if it’s under 2,000 and i found something perfect for me i believe. The MOT is good and has no advisories  for a couple years. I think it looks good imo and can’t see anything that faults it.  

My parents are really skeptical of buying the car only because of the high mileage but i keep trying to tell them theres not gonna be much cars with low millage for such a low cost car.

Also make sure stuff that’s meant to be changed on that car at specific mileage intervals (stuff like timing belts and water pumps, big expensive stuff) has been (especially if it’s important).

An old car (which it will be with your budget) with low milage would be odd if anything because it may have not been driven much due to a persistent issue, or been of the road for a while long enough to develop one, or it could have never had its engine warmed up properly etc. I’m not saying that just to put you of buying a low mileage car, odds are it’s fine, just something u can say to your parents.

1mvibwg,"Leaving company car, Did I make a mistake?","Hi Reddit, 

I’ve decided to leave company car through work as I was seeing less benefits by the day. My company car was an entry level new Golf costing me £225 per month, I’d get a new one every 3-6 months. If my car was required, I’d normally have to switch out to an entry level polo for sometimes half the month. 

Before going into company car, I had always bought cheap cars with cash, most recently enjoying a Focus ST225 mk2.5 which I still have (will sell soon). Maintenance and fixing cars was never an issue for me and I enjoyed owning and working on my own car. 

On my ever long quest to reduce my monthly outgoings to save for a house deposit in this tough cost of living recession I was thinking about this £225 leaving my account each month. I don’t need a new car, not obsessed with a reg plate, impressing friends or keeping up with the Jones’.

For the past 6 months I was thinking about leaving company car. The idea would be to get a cheap, reliable and lovely car to drive for my 44 mile total commute each day. At work I’m fortunate enough to have access to buy trade cars. One day this trade car came in, the perfect car. 

The car in question was a Passat CC 2.0TDI from 2013, lovely specification with heated leather seats, manual gearbox and heated windscreen + other bits and bobs. I looked though the maintenance record and service paperwork from the previous 1 owner totaling almost £8000. In 2024 it had a new clutch, timing belt, ac condenser, egr and countless other things like 4 brand new Dunlop tyres. It’s a bit rough around the edges (currently getting the wheels done £32 per wheel at staff rate) and has 150,000 miles however the full service history convinced me it’s a good purchase. 

I was able to get a new mot and a multipoint health check before purchasing it through work to give me confidence. 

The cost: 

Car £1800

Tax £35 

Insurance £405 (will go down after non fault accident comes off next year) 

Total: £2240 

This car gets me 55-60mpg on my commute depending on traffic and is an absolute pleasure to drive, the leather seats partnered with the amazing build quality and one of my favorite engines makes me believe I’ve made the right choice. 

I’m keen to hear other people’s thoughts and other similar experiences

I'm not completely clueless with cars but I am no mechanic, and I'm at the end of my rope with this. 

  
I'm looking for anyone who might have experienced this, or might know what it is, because I'm stuck with a car I can't keep and I can't sell. 

I've had this car for several years and am pretty fond of her. She's a good runaround, fuel efficient and nippy. But she's dying and it's one of those problems that cannot be diagnosed. I am in a position where I will have to throw this car to the junkyard because I cannot get the problem fixed, and she's going to get me killed if this keeps happening. 

While driving, about ten to fifteen minutes into the journey, the car will beep, display 'Service vehicle soon' on the user display, and then will go into limp mode. Turning her off and on again will get this to go away for five to ten more minutes the first few times, then eventually, won't help at all. (Just to clarify, she gets a full service every year, one of these was very recent, so it's not that she needs one.) There are no engine warning lights of any kind. No smoke, no sounds, no physical sign of anything wrong with the car. Just beeping and then limp mode.

Obviously, being in limp mode isn't too much of a problem in small, slow roads, but if you're on a main road, this is extremely dangerous. 

She's been towed for this twice now, the first time six months ago, at which point the mechanic went through the normal checks to try and find issues such as fuel injectors, cleared out the DPF filter, and she ran perfectly for six months.   
This week the problem is back. Exactly the same.   
I had her towed and now the garage can't get the fault to replicate, which means they can't diagnose it. Which means they can't fix it.   
I can't be driving a car that may at any moment put me in limp mode in a dangerous situation. 

Has anyone experienced this problem? Do you know what causes it?   
It seems like it must be a sensor fault of some kind, because there's no sign of an actual problem, only a 'perceived' problem by the onboard computer.

It’s got probably 120,000 miles on it. Drives nicely.

It did need a serious clean when I got it but wet vacuumed the entire inside of the car and a good old mopping on the outside. 

It costs £20 a year to tax it and I get 300+ miles out of a tank which equates to about £40 every 4 weeks in fuel. 
If you drove it more sensibly you could probably get more out of it but you gotta give it some to get some good pace.

It’s genuinely fun to drive, it’s pretty nippy round town, small enough to fit into any space and cheap enough that if it got stolen tonight I wouldn’t even bother claiming on the insurance, I’d just buy another one. 

At 50mph they are absolutely fine. Trying to push from 60-70 is a bit of effort sometimes as it is sluggish.

I'm planning to buy this red 2015 Mercedes E class and I'm just wondering if you guys can kindly give me any advice on what to look out for when I go to see and test drive this Mercedes this Friday as you guys know your stuff quite well :)

I've done a HPI check and everything seems alright apart from this car having outstanding finance (Unit Stocking I think, which I will ask them about), I plan on taking an OBD2 scanner just to see if there are any hidden codes or warning lights as well.

I know these cars have issues with the rear subframe becoming rusted as well, which I will check.

I had diesels before, so I will try to see if there are any DPF or EGR issues too. I will also test out the gearbox to see if it is responsive or sluggish, which is a major red flag. I will also check if all the electronics work including the pan roof and just general dipstick, oil filter, exhaust smoke checks. but is there any major potential issues that I should look out for this Friday?

I had a 2008 petrol 1.4 TSI VW Golf and a diesel 2.0 Jaguar XE with the Ingenium engine before (which surprisingly ran well) and a 2023 petrol BMW 2 Series M Sport coupe, but I've never had a Mercedes before, so I don't know too much about these cars, so any help with this will be massively appreciated.

This Mercedes is 10 years old, had 3 previous owners, full service history and a recent gearbox oil change and only 38k, so it doesn't sound too bad? I just hope it's not a lemon. Should I walk away as I don't want to be stuck with expensive Mercedes repairs or should I buy it? 

Thank you so much everyone!
