Finally got it towed to Hyundai this morning and they told me they can’t work on it because the engine wasn’t fully put together.. I called to confirm but my warranty company told me they paid for the auto shop to put EVERYTHING back together which he didn’t. That’s obviously negligence. I called to confront him and asked if they have cameras and he pretended the phone was breaking up and hung up. I called again and was told they do have cameras so I did say that I would come up there tomorrow for all of the footage and he said okay.

We only had it for 2 years, and it was in the shop no less than 6 times for the transmission kicking/jerking/popping out of gear. I travel for work so this is the wifes car to take kids to school/practices. Anyways, we had had enough, and traded it in to get away from the problems Ford is ignoring with their 10spd's. 

We ended up getting a used 2023 Suburban that is at the tail end of it's powertrain warranty. It was much more than the Expedition, and we just didn't have room for the $5k extended warranty the dealer was pushing on us.  It was a clean carfax, and appeared the previous owner took it to the dealer for all maintenance/oil changes, so we felt good about it.  Well, not even 2 months afer buying it, it started missing and making a knocking sound. Took it in, and turned out to be a failed lifter. Luckily covered under the powertrain, but that ends in 2k miles... and they only replaced the failed lifter, not all of them (figures) so now I'm shopping for warranties, as I am now learning that the chevy 5.3 and their active fuel management is causing lifter failures, and the repair bill for this one would have been just shy of $10k.

I tried getting a GM warranty but since I'm outside the 3yr/36k mfg warranty, apparently I can't get one from GM now... So that leaves 3rd party. Unfortunately it seems most require you to go through a dealership to buy, and that alone has been frustrating to get responses from dealerships when I inquire.

1-800-warranty.com: $1809 for 36 months, no mileage limit, but is a subscription base, month to month service agreement not backed by any insurance company and seems a bit vauge on what their coverage limits are.

Endurance: $4k, vauge on the fine print

Luckily I was about a mile from home so I was able to get it home. Now it starts and runs like normal (but I haven't driven it). Could this be an alternator issue or something else?

The only other thing going on is that the 'oil life' warning light has been going on for a while. The oil life is actually fine (4,000 miles in from a synthetic change) but the mechanic forgot to reset the oil life so the car thinks the oil is in bad shape. Could that have caused the dash lights to flicker, like some sort of extra warning?

Issue: the car makes this weird lugging noise, but only after i drive for an hour AND only when i make sharp turns.

Most people I know says there is no way it is a transmission issue. The vehicle is a 2012 Subaru outback, Manuel transmission. Would you guys say the transmission is a fair assessment or should i ove forward with just the CV Axel repair?

1oq67i1,Coolant Question Corolla 2017 87k miles,"Hello,

Novice question but I had my coolant flushed by this shop exactly two years ago.

The coolant looks low now. Should I top this off? 

My issue is that the shop that did the flush just tells me they used “pink” coolant and don’t seem to understand there are different types, so I don’t know what type of pink coolant they used. Am I safe just buying Toyota spec pink coolant and topping it off or would this be a bad idea?

1oq65uo,Do I need to replace my Catalytic Converter?,"My (164k miles) 2012 Nissan Altima's cluster gage was lit up recently. ABS & Traction control lights on (Code C1107), Service Engine Soon (Code P2A00). The TPMS and Master Service light were on as well but those went off when I got an air top off. I got it scanned by AutoZone and it said I needed to replace the front right brake sensor and the upstream O2 sensor. I have the papers from AutoZone I can post them if that helps too.

It was saying on the secondary codes that there was a cylinder 4 misfire but I was told that having a faulty sensor will throw that code and it will be resolved when I change the sensor. Plus the car did not feel like it was misfiring at all it was driving smoothly. But I am not aware if you can feel anything if it is misfiring.

Secondary Codes thrown: P2A00 (x2), P0304, P0300, P0826.

I bought and changed both sensors myself as it was very easy and afterwards, all the lights on the dash actually did go off for the remainder of the day. I drove it around a decent bit that day and night with no lights coming back on.

When I woke up this morning and got in the car the Service Engine Soon light was back on. I took it back to AutoZone and got it scanned again and now it says the Catalytic Converter needs to be replaced (Code P0420). The secondary codes are P0420 (x2), P0304, P0300, P2A00, P0826. I realize that three of these codes are the same secondary codes as before.

Now I am unsure if the cylinders are really misfiring, if the catalytic converter needs to be replaced, or something else. I don't really hear anything when driving. There is a slight loud/high pitched sound (similar to when your brakes need to be changed) but its not all the time and its mostly when braking so I don't think thats it. I don't want to keep putting money into the wrong thing. Why would the Catalytic Converter not have shown up on earlier scans? I'm not too familiar with how it works.

I saw somewhere that cats are covered by an extended mandatory emissions warranty? I bought this car used and in cash so I am not sure if anyone has experience or advice that would be helpful.

I do mostly basic car stuff myself - Brakes, Oil changes, these easy sensors, etc. but have not ever done anything major myself. Im told I'd have to cut & weld if I wanted to replace my cat myself and don't think i'd have the capability.

Also, I am a little short on cash at the moment and start a new job soon (which I need this car for). Is this something that I can drive on for a while and it can wait? Or is this going to become a bigger issue soon?

Thank you!

EDIT: I think this is a 4 cylinder 2.5L engine but I really am not sure. If anyone knows how I can figure that out that would be helpful. I also have my own scanner, but really only know how to use it to see the codes its throwing, that is why I took it to AutoZone, because they can actually tell me what to do with the code. Thank you!

1oq3zvd,Mechanic wants me to replace a 2 month old clutch,"Hi, I needed my clutch replacing (Peugeot 5008 2021) and at the time the mechanic suggested I also do the DMF, I was hesitant due to cost and my own cash flow and so said no, they did not push me to do both.

I have now had time to read up a bit more about it and also notice a few clunky noises while driving, and gears can sometimes be a little stiff to engage, so I decided I better get it done sooner rather than later.

I asked the same mechanic for a quote for the DMF. They told me they will not replace the DMF without also replacing the clutch, even though the clutch is only around 2 months old. They want £1700 for this.

I am quite upset as they did not insist, or stress enough the importance of doing both when they replaced the clutch, so I am going to pay for a clutch twice in 2 months.

I understand it is recommended to do both together but are they right to insist on doing both now, or should I look elsewhere? Thank you.

The noise is basically a faint ticking/rattling sound at idle, which only appears after 30+ minutes of riding (fully warmed up).
It is NOT present on cold start or after short rides ( 10 minute ride to grocery store, I checked and couldn't make it out ). 
It also disappears completely when revving or riding, so it's not proportional to the rpms.
Weirdly enough, it's kinda Intermittent as in sometimes goes away then comes back while idling at the next stop.

What I've checked:
• Oil level is good (near upper limit)- Last oil change 3-4k km ago
• Clutch lever pull test - no change
• Bike runs perfectly - no performance issues, shifts fine, full power

Is this normal or should I be concerned? Cam chain tensioner? Heat shield? Loose valves? Some loose bolt somewhere?

Apparently the stock tires have significantly soft edges that wear quickly, especially with frequent cornering. You mentioned you don't drive aggressively, however judging by your linked video if you're taking twisting trails with lots of turns that can also be a factor. 

Lastly, apparently the Leaf also just straight up eats tires; you can combat this by purchasing higher quality tires, presumably with harder rubber, and frequently rotate but inevitably it will still eat the edges.

The car had been taken very good care of its entire life and has never ever been overheated once.


I’m pretty mechanically inclined and have been building cars/engines since I was a teenager and figured there was probably an air bubble in the system, they picked it up from the parking lot she pulled it off in and are saying that it probably needs a head gasket, they didn’t say anything about there being water in the oil, it wasn’t smoking, and it wasn’t misfiring or anything either. They said they think as it warms up the headgasket separates. None of this seems very technical or like they did any real testing.  If I was there I’d be working on it but I live 2,000 miles away..

1opyh19,Ford Focus 1.0 EcoBoost – Slight vibration at warm idle after replacing ignition coil (P0301) — normal for 3-cyl?,"Car: 2021 Ford Focus ST-Line

Engine: 1.0 EcoBoost (3-cylinder)

Mileage: 60,000 km

I recently had a misfire on cylinder 1 (DTC P0301). The ignition coil on cylinder 1 was replaced and the check engine light is gone. The car now drives normally — full power, no hesitation, no misfire under load.

However, I'm noticing a small vibration of the engine at warm idle (with the hood open). The car itself does \*not\* shake inside, and the idle rpm is stable. It’s just visually noticeable that the engine ""wobbles"" slightly, which I’m not sure I paid attention to before the repair.

Given that this is a 3-cylinder engine, I know a certain degree of vibration is expected due to inherent imbalance. But I’d like to confirm:

Is this mild engine movement at warm idle normal for the 1.0 EcoBoost, or could this suggest something like:

\- Engine mount wear

\- ECU fuel trim still re-learning after the misfire

\- MAP sensor needing cleaning

\- Or possibly injector adaptation adjusting after the coil failure

Here the video:

No check engine light now.

No loss of power.

No vibration felt in the cabin.

Only visible movement when watching the engine itself.

Would appreciate input from anyone familiar with this engine.

Undercoating doesnt stop or slow rust that is already in place, in many cases it can make it worse by trapping rust, moisture and salt.

No worries if you're using it on something not super important to the car but I wouldn't recommend using it on the frame of your vehicle especially if you live in a rust belt.

There are places that do waxes instead. I dont know enough about it but from what i heard its way better but needs to be reapplied occasionally

1oq5wi7,Why EVs suck,"# Why Electric Vehicles Are Not Practical or Truly Eco-Friendly

Many people believe that electric vehicles (EVs) are eco-friendly, but the truth is far more complicated. While EVs may seem clean on paper, the hidden costs of their production and impact tell a different story. EVs are not as sustainable, reliable, or cost-efficient as gas or diesel vehicles, and forcing a full transition could harm the environment, economy, and national security.

Mining for lithium, cobalt, and nickel is highly detrimental to ecosystems. Extracting these materials requires massive amounts of water and diesel-powered machinery, which produces significant pollution  ironically for vehicles marketed as “green.” Battery production releases more CO₂ than manufacturing a gas-powered car, and most of the electricity used to charge EVs still comes from coal or natural gas. Battery disposal is limited and hazardous, and many spent batteries end up in landfills. Additionally, EVs are heavier than traditional cars, which increases tire wear and road damage.

Beyond environmental concerns, EVs would also disrupt millions of jobs and local economies. Mechanics, factory workers, and refinery employees could lose their livelihoods, while small auto parts stores, gas stations, and suppliers could close. Without tax income from fuel sales and with rising unemployment, the government would struggle to manage the economic fallout. Many small towns that thrive on blue-collar jobs in oil, construction, and manufacturing could face extreme poverty and declining tax revenue.

EVs also fall short in performance and practicality. Diesel and gas engines still outperform EVs in torque, towing, and reliability under harsh conditions. Even small engines, like a 5.7 Hemi V8 or a V6, produce more low-end torque than most electric vehicles. EVs cannot tow heavy loads over long distances without frequent recharging, whereas diesel engines like Cummins heavy-duty trucks can travel thousands of miles on a single tank. Modding or repairing EVs is difficult, expensive, and requires specialized tools and training. Gas and diesel engines remain essential for agriculture, power tools, and utility vehicles.

Critical infrastructure would also be at risk. Military vehicles require instant refueling and reliability in extreme environments; electric tanks and aircraft would be ineffective without charging stations. Cargo ships and tankers depend on diesel for long global routes, and no infrastructure exists to recharge the enormous batteries required to move a 200,000-ton ship. Without diesel-powered shipping, global trade would slow, threatening industries, food supply, medicine, and manufacturing worldwide.

EVs would also disrupt culture and affordability. Car enthusiasts would lose the ability to modify and repair their vehicles without significant funds and specialized equipment. Motorsports and car shows like NASCAR, NHRA, and Barrett-Jackson could fade. With the average household income in 2024 at $83,000 and the average EV costing over $55,000, many families would struggle to afford an electric car while covering maintenance, food, and other living expenses. EVs would limit access to travel and reduce freedom for the average household.

Until electric vehicles can match the reliability, power, and practicality of gas and diesel engines, they remain a costly illusion of progress rather than a true solution for the planet.

1oqbdzi,2012 Acura MDX - Electrical issues immediately after brake job. Shop says it's coincidental. What do you think?,"Hey everyone, looking for some honest feedback here because I'm not sure if I'm being paranoid or if my gut is right.

Just picked up my 2012 Acura MDX from a local shop yesterday. They did:

* Front and rear brake pads and rotors
* Differential fluid change
* Parking brake shoes

The work itself seems fine, but literally the moment I got in the car, I started having electrical issues that I've NEVER had before:

**Issues that started immediately:**

* All seat memory settings were wiped (I could understand this if they had to disconnect the battery?)
* Seat memory buttons now work intermittently - sometimes I have to hold them, sometimes press 3x, even after reprogramming
* Side mirrors now tilt down in reverse (might be a feature I never noticed?)
* One time the mirror didn't return to normal position after shifting out of reverse
* Backup camera randomly shut off once or twice

I brought these concerns to the shop and they're saying it's purely coincidental - that they didn't touch anything electrical. They said these are known issues for my car. But the timing seems way too suspicious. I've owned this car for years with zero electrical gremlins, and suddenly all this the same day I pick it up from brake work?

**My question:** Is there ANY way brake/differential work could cause these issues? Am I crazy for thinking this is related?

I want to go back and have a conversation with them, but I need to know if I have a leg to stand on here or if this really could just be terrible timing.

Thanks in advance for any insight!",2,1762464171.0,8,mechanic,1762544060,2025-11-06 21:22:51,2025-11-07 19:34:20,"ilikecowtales (Score: 1): The mirrors in those cars will tilt down when put into reverse if the left or right lever on the mirror adjusting switch is selected. If you don’t want that to happen, toggle that rocker switch into the middle position (between left and right). Also those mirrors do like to stick down sometimes when they are older or already adjusted lower. 

As far as your other issues, those vehicles are notorious for driver side door wiring harnesses to fail. It’s the rubber tube/boot looking thing that goes between the body of the car and the door. They deteriorate inside the rubber and the wires break, causing random issues for seats, mirrors, windows, anything with a button on the door, just depends which wire(s) break. 

Also, less common but still possible, they sometimes leak water in the rear hatch area through a roof seam and get the fuse box wet on the drivers side that’s in the rear hatch area, again causing some random electrical issues. 

Both areas can be inspected fairly easily for damaged wires or water, respectively. Door harness slightly more difficult to look at, but can be done. 

Brake and fluid work normally wouldn’t cause these issues, other than the memory seats being reset if they unhooked the battery. I wouldn’t have, but they may have. 

Unfortunately that wiring harness can fail at any time when the door opens or closes, just a matter of time. Could have broken when you opened the door to get in and leave the shop. Same with the roof leak, can happen at any time once the sealant dries and cracks and you introduce enough water, either by rain or car wash. With the age of the vehicle, both definitely possible at any time.

Both of the issues I mentioned may have no relevance to your issues or situation. Also no idea what the shop did, definitely not saying they did nothing wrong, not sticking up for them in anyway, just explaining from my experience. 18 year tech, 7 at Acura.

The pressure regulator is designed to increase fuel pressure under load. If you hit the accelerator, and the fuel pressure  doesn't jump up, the regulator or the vacuum line to the regulator is bad. These engines had plastic vacuum lines that get brittle and break. I would check that first.

2013 Dodge Durango. 250,000km.

My car wouldn't start yesterday - I suspected a fuel pump issue. The garage confirmed the fuel pump issue but they have come back with a lengthy list of problems.

Is it possible to apply sealant to a fuel tank or is replacing the only option? Ps, I never noticed any fuel dripping and have no stains in my driveway.

 They reported: 

• Fuel pump needs to replacing - no fuel pressure from pump to engine

• Fuel tank needs replacing -  it's leaking

• front & rear brake pads needs to replacing - brake disc's thickness is below minimum. Skimming or polishing not an option. 

• Engine mounts & gear mount leaking needs to replacing

• front shocks absorber leaking needs to replacing

where is it specifically leaking from, there are many ports and holes in a fuel tank, is it a sensor seal, a drilled hole, a crack, an O-ring on the fuel sender?

Fuel pump is no surprise. It's the weak point in all EFI systems. They run constantly with just gasoline for lube, which to be honest, gasoline is terrible at. 

The fuel tank leak is surprising, considering how clean it is under there. That will be an expensive part. But you might be able to find a good one at a junkyard. You'll want to find a Durango that's basically rust free to pull one from.

Maybe put off the engine mounts, if the funds aren't there, though it's cheaper to get this stuff all done at once. 

The brakes? Do them yourself. Go and find a YouTube video on brakes for that year and model. 

Otherwise, that truck looks pretty damned clean underneath, and is probably worth putting the money into."

To start: I took the truck in for a evap and heater core replacement. All went well until two weeks after when driving down the road the airbag light came on for 5 ish minutes then off. Two days later it came on and has since been locked in (about a month). 

First issue: mechanic scanned and got the code: (B0001-11 driver front squib 1 control circuit short to ground active) they told me more likely than not it was the clock spring. I ordered an EBay clock spring (yeah now I know🤦🏻‍♂️) and after install got the same light, took it out and installed an OEM from WorldPartsDirect. Still got the same light. 

Today: I dropped it off at the mechanic and they said they chased every wire, relay, airbag and checked for grounds every where and still the only issue they can find is getting 0.2ohms off the clock spring. I find it hard to believe it’s the clock spring but they are ordering another to throw in and give it a shot incase I somehow got two duds and that way they know for sure the install was done right. 

The new clock spring gets installed Tuesday. If this ends up not being the issue does anyone have another idea? They researched and looked all day but weren’t able to find anything else. 

TLDR; Airbag light on and truck is on third clock spring replacement and it’s not fixing it. Only issue found after chasing every wire is 0.2ohms off the clock spring. Any other ideas what it could be or did I get two defective clock springs in a row?

Not sure if there is some wiring I missed hooking up or something that locks it when it’s new I need to take out or something. 

The little plastic housing in the bottom right is what was all cracked to hell on the old one.  So it wouldn’t stop in the closed position and would try to keep folding.

1oq8tkc,Changing jobs at 7 months... worth it or should I wait?,"Hey ask mechanics, I work in a large fleet leasing company and started about 7 months ago at 22/hr. I recently got offered a job at another company that does transport & logistics; they offered $26. My main apprehension is that this jump in pay doesn't feel too significant and I'm not in a rush to leave my current job. I mainly want to get more experience since right now I spend a fair amount of time bullshitting around because of a lack of work to do.

I don't have any qualms about leaving my current company since it's not exactly the most professional environment, but since I have less than a year under my belt I would definitely stay at the next job for at least 2 years before I would feel comfortable job hopping again.

Do you think it's worth changing over? It feels like a big risk for a minimal increase in pay. The shop manager at the new job has expressed that I would be getting more work to do and that there are a lot of trucks that need to be fixed on any given day. I feel like I could get paid more if I wait it out another 5-6 months and have a solid year of experience under my belt.

I was also told flat out that the job is $26 an hour and that there was no room to negotiate. Part of me feels like I'm getting dicked over but I can't be too sure since I haven't been in the field very long. My current gig is an apprenticeship program, and I do feel like there was some bait and switch where I spend a lot more time cleaning and pumping gas than actually working on trucks. My fear is that this new company is withholding something like that from me and I'll be forced to deal with whatever situation I end up in because I 100% cannot look again in under 2 years to try and keep my resume clean.

My first impression is that $2000+ is a bit steep, but that is incredibly dependent on a couple of things that we don’t know. One of them being, what is the typical labor rate in your area? Some places you can easily find labor rates below $100 per labor hour while in other places $200 per labor hour is completely normal. Another major factor is what brand/quality parts are being quoted. For example, OEM will typically cost noticeably more than most aftermarket options but there will commonly be a difference in quality.

1oq1zqx,Bad steering pump?,"Hello, recently I replaced the serpentine belt on my Ford Transit Connect, and after a few starts, the belt began to make a squealing noise. After a while, it started making the sound you can hear in the video.

I replaced the tensioner pulley because it had some play and a rattle, but that didn’t help.  
When I had the belt off, I tried moving the power steering pump pulley, and there was a few millimeters of play.

When I spray even a tiny bit of WD-40 on the inside of the belt, near the power steering pump pulley, the sound goes away instantly.

I’ve also just found out that the belt I installed is 5 mm longer than it’s supposed to be.  
Just to note, the tensioner pulley is spring-loaded, so it adjusts itself.

So, my question is: is the sound caused by a bad power steering pump, or by the serpentine belt being 5 mm too long?

Thanks for any advice.

So using simplified numbers, lets say that you put 10 gallons in and drove 200 miles that gets a 20 mpg average, and that the tank in your Transit holds 25 gallons (depends on the options but should be listed in the owners manual). Subtract 5 gallons as a safety measure, that gives you 400 miles. So fill at 350 miles and you don't have a problem.

Just trying to figure out what to do next. 

I did everything kinda ass backwards..

✅I got new tires for her recently! She’s on jackstands currently so they don’t flatten and crack like my last ones did. 

✅I got a brand new battery as it was obviously dead and still within warranty. That’s inside the house for now. 

She needs a new bumper and fender as I hit a tire that was turned all the way out when it was dark out… Cracked the bumper and deformed it but now my turn signal light won’t stay mounted. Ran over the original turn signal that the previous guy had the halos wired up to. So that all ripped out. (Bummer) Kinda last on the list though. 

⚠️On some headass shit- I did fuck around and turn it on one day just to hear it roar… You guessed it- no new gas or anything. Didn’t leave it on long at all though. Am I cooked?

❓I did read about getting a new fuel pump. There was hardly any gas in it anyway when I parked it but it’s still on the list to get. A friend had even said may want to replace the fuel tank? In case it rusted inside? Idk…

❓I know I need an oil change for sure. What other fluids do I need to change? Also I’m assuming spark plugs need to be changed first as well?

❓My E brake though…. Bought the car from a friend and I was NEVER able to lift the EBrake handle. I don’t even know where to start for that so please lmk!

I parked her and disconnected the original battery because it kept going off in the middle of the night. And cops kept getting called out for a noise complaint. Replaced the door lock actuator and have the door jamb switch that I have yet to put on since it’s just been sitting. 
❓The window doesn’t go down and back up when you open and close the door anymore though. Anybody know why that could be?

❓(Pictured) Also, when I first got it over 10 years ago- I ripped out the felt foam-backed carpet feeling thing on the doors because I thought they were ugly and didn’t realize the actual leather liner was supposed to attach to it. How do I fix that?? I find the inserts and stuff but it’s always stuff that attaches to the thing I ripped out. 

❓It also makes a metal clank noise when going over bumps and potholes. Think it’s the “Sway Bar Link/Bushing”?? When I push down on the driver fender and “bounce it”, it makes the same noise. 

❓Is it even supposed to bounce? Is that another thing I need to add to my list? 

I’m very ignorant when it comes to cars and fixing them and I hate that. I also get scared to DIY things and fuck it up too, but I’m willing to try whatever to get my Mustang road worthy again. Just need to know what I’m missing.

1opo2au,2015 Jeep Cherokee 2.4L 4 Cylinder Transmission Solenoid Replacement Question,"I have a 2015 Jeep Cherokee 2.4L 4 Cylinder and it's been running like trash. [257,000 miles]. I believe it's the Transmission Solenoid. I watched some youtube videos and I believe this is something I can do on my own. To get to the solenoid I need to remove the transmission pan, take out the old solenoid and replace them with the new one. The youtube video looked pretty straightforward and I've done my own brakes, oil changes, spark plugs and a few other basic car things. 

Question: Can I remove the pan carefully as to not spill any transmission fluid and put the pan back on after the job is complete without putting any new transmission fluid in?

I ask because I believe in order to add transmission fluid I'll need to get a special ""fill tool"" to fill it from some access point which requires taking off the front driver wheel.

Symptoms which Iead to me thinking it was transmission solenoid:
- Car won't shift from 4-5 unless it hits 3k-5k RPMS
- Car sometimes drops back down from 5th to 4th on its own
- Car has been running steadily at 3000 rpms once highway speeds are hit (55-65mph)
- When cold the car ""spits and sputters"" when shifted into gear
- Sometimes when going from 4th to 5th gear the check engine light will flash and put the car in ""limp mode"" and I'm stuck in 3rd gear
- Car DOES NOT bang/jolt when shifting
- Car DOES NOT slip when grabbing gears

Anyway I hope to get some insight and figured I'd throw in more details than I needed to help with follow up questions. 

TL;DR: Can I change out my Transmission Solenoids located under the transmission pan, without adding transmission fluid? (Or is there a way to add fluid without a specialty tool?)

1oqda9n,2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4WD not starting,"So, this all started about a month ago. I went to use my car, and usually I would put my foot on the brake, press, put my finger on the start button, and it revs up smoothly, but this one time, I pressed my foot on the gas, pressed my finger on the start, and it revved, but it cranked a little bit at the end, and then it revved up to start the engine. That was very peculiar.

So then, that went on and off for a couple of days. I would go to the car—sometimes it would rev up smoothly, and other times it would rev up, clank a little, and then start the engine.

About three weeks later I was getting in the car from gym, I had all my lights on, and my phone was connected to the car through a cable. I was talking to my friend, and after hanging up the call, I tried to start my car—but it just clicked and then nothing. It clicked again, and still nothing. It took me about eight or nine times pressing the start button on and off before the car finally revved up.

I thought the problem had to be the battery, based on everything I had noticed. So I started sitting in my car for a few minutes before leaving, just to make sure the battery had enough charge.

Last night, however, after work, I went to my car to leave—and it wouldn’t start. Then I noticed a message on the dashboard related to the start-stop feature. It said “Start/Stop not read - Engine off.”

I then had a friend of mine come to help me jumpstart the car, since I thought the issue might be the battery. But even after using the jumper cables, the car still didn’t start.

So my friend ended up calling AAA to see if they could help. When the AAA technician arrived, he tested the battery and said it was reading at 12.4 volts, meaning it was fine and the problem wasn’t the main battery.

The AAA technician thought it could be the starter. But when I mentioned the second battery, he said that could possibly be it as well.

So then I went to AutoZone and talked to one of the employees there about what was going on. He also said it could possibly be the starter.

So this morning, I had a mechanic come look at the car. I told him everything that had been going on, and he tested the auxiliary battery. He said it was reading 12.4 volts, which meant it was fine. That left me even more confused about what’s actually going on with my car.

He believes it could be the starter as well, but he’s not 100% sure. After doing some testing and trying to jumpstart the car again, it still wouldn’t start. So, based on trial and error, he’s leaning toward it being the starter—but again, he’s just making an educated guess.

I’ve also been reading about possible issues with the 2018 four-wheel-drive models. Some people mentioned a brake pedal malfunction recall, others said it might be that the auxiliary battery isn’t holding a charge long enough, and some said it’s likely the starter. I’ve even read that it could be related to a leak in the fuse box or water damage affecting electrical components.

At this point, I just don’t know what it is—but what do you guys think the problem could be?",2,1762468656.0,2,AutoMechanics,1762544060,2025-11-06 22:37:36,2025-11-07 19:34:20,"ruddy3499 (Score: 1): First, the batteries are connected together and must be separated before any kind of testing.

1oqekb9,£95 Rover is backk and sort of fixed??,"Post history for context

Hello all, sorry for the delay, second year Mech Eng is no joke.

  
After being being bollocked by uni for (I have lost track of time tbh), I have finally managed to spend some time on what seems to be becoming my new pride and joy. I have dug around through the paperwork and found out its had a head gasket change in 2012 because it blew (who would have seen that coming). It also had 'special' spark plugs put in in 06. 

(Quick rundown of clutch issues if you forgot: clutch would \*\*not\*\* slip. struggle moving shifter into place, especially when downshifting, inconsistent biting point, pedal felt a bit dodgy but as expected for an old POS, higher than normal healthy biting point, when downshifting into first: shifter would get stuck and car would shudder and stall.)

Anyways I decided to have a go at bleeding and swapping the old clutch fluid through the banjo bolt on the slave cylinder because why not (no bleeding nipple ffs)...the process I used is a bit complex (for me anyways) so I'll lay it out neatly:

Basically the system is pressurised by pressing clutch, so we use that pressure to push air and old fluid out of banjo nut. What we did was soak up the clutch fluid in the tank as much as we could and replaced. We then depressed the clutch pedal 50% and cracked the banjo (to get some air out), we then depressed it 100% and cracked it slightly more (to get some fluid out). No fluid came out, the new clutch fluid level did not decrease. We repeated this like 8 times. This lead us inexperienced unskilled mechanics to believe that there was just barely any fluid left, so we had a look for a leak but could not find one.

We drove the car for two mins (the tyres are a bit dodgy so don't plan on driving more) and went up and down through the gears. We hit a very steep hill in 5th, downshifted into third and it chugged on perfectly fine.

We also gave it a good clean and it looks good as new (minus the staples keeping the door cloth on).  
I am a bit confused about the clutch, it seems to have fixed itself, the biting point is high but consistent, downshifts fine and drives all good basically. I know it was only 2 mins, but it was deffo better than the first 2 mins of driving it when I picked it up. Have I gotten lucky or is there something else going on? Could the master cylinder not be pushing clutch fluid?

  
As always thanks for the help, I look forward to reading more stories of Rovers (if you lot still have any).

OrdinaryAncient3573 (Score: 15): Does your clutch pedal get harder if you pump it multiple times? If so, that's a sign of air in the system getting progressively more compressed.

If not, my first guess is that the master cylinder needs rebuilding/replacing. If your old Rover is anything like my old MG, parts places will be so delighted to get rid of old stock that hasn't moved in years that they'll practically pay you to take it away, so a new master cylinder will be cheap enough you won't even think about the seals. 

The way you did the bleeding sounds more likely to have introduced air from the slave end than anything. If you aren't getting it hard by pumping - oo-err - then put the pedal all the way down, open bolt, close it, raise pedal, and repeat. You're going to want to keep doing it until clean, new fluid comes through, so you're going to want something to soak it up or catch it. 

Then again, it might have nothing to do with the clutch hydraulics at all. Could be that a shonky old gearbox with somewhat fucked synchros and really old oil was just being balky. IDK. Just guessing, really, until you can confirm the clutch hydraulics are all working nicely with fresh fluid."

Ensure you buy the cleaner and the sealant and follow the instructions; water just beads off and it lasts for ages. The only downside is that if you let dirt build up on the wipers, then it can start to smear on the windscreen but if you keep the wipers clean (which I'd do anyway), then you barely need to use them.

It looks like historically I'm awful at buying cars. Almost every car I've bought (bar 1) has ended up being a dud from the get go. Previously, I've just eaten the cost cause I bought cheap whip arounds. 

This time I wanted a long term car. I spent £17k on a Ford, secondhand from the dealer. It's 4 years old and supposedly came with a clean MOT and service. 

After 4 months, the Front Flexi Exhaust has given the ghost which means I need to replace both that component and the Cat Converter as they come as a single unit. My local Ford garage is quoting £1700. 

I went back to the dealer via their warranty and they offered 50% which is nice of them. But I'm trying to pay £0 because for a £17k car to fail after 4 months feels ridiculous. 

Has anyone tried using the Consumer Rights Act to get a repair done? How did you fare?

However, yesterday we went past the Mini showroom, previously I ruled out Minis as I thought they were expensive to buy and heard they are unreliable. But I did some research and they don’t seem that expensive on Autotrader, they are a similar price to a Suzuki (looking at 2016-2018 models), and the F56 seems to have a lot of positive feedback in terms of reliability. I think Minis are so stylish, one thing I wasn’t impressed with by the Swift was the interior whereas the Mini interior looks great. 

I am now considering buying one but want to hear some opinions from others first. I’m looking at the 1.5 Cooper model or possibly the Cooper SD but either is fine really. My budget is 10k I’m wondering are they likely to be lemons at that price? Anything to look out for?

Firstly the cons. The interior build quality is crap but everything works and nothings is broken. The sound deadening is crap, in the less expensive models driving in the rain is quite loud. The infotainment is very basic, its like a windows phone sort of thing but works. The reverse synchro thingy is crap so you often crunch into reverse but it does no harm to the gearbox.

Pros, the cars weigh nothing and driving them round bends is fun. You can swerve and miss any pot hole. The power is good as the cars weigh nothing, particularly when you are up to speed sort of 30-60 stuff is very good. There is not allot to go wrong. Easy to park. Cheap to run. They all look good. Its so easy to carry speed, something that doesn't get talked enough about imo.

Overview they are good cars for most people. They are the total opposite of the god awful cars that are on the market today.

2 days ago I sat in a Suzuki swift sport, a 21 plate. It was the worst seat I have ever seen in a car. I am a thin tall man, my ass was too wide for the seat due to the bolstering. It was horrendous so avoid them if you value any comfort. I highly doubt the normal swift has this sports seat.

Minis are better for taller drivers. Honestly, I am not that keen on minis. The ride is absolutely terrible due to the run flat tires. They feel heavy. They probably handle great on flat roads but near me its pot hole city. I have driven them and never liked the drive. I also don't like the central big fat screen.

If I was spending 10k and in the market (I am actually in this market plus a few k atm) swift would be the one I would test drive. Ignis is great too, its a bit taller so good headroom, rear space and boot. Celeriac is a bit shit as is baleno or whater the f its called. I actually feel that the swift of ignis would be the drivers choice, minis aren't great I think they are massively overated.

I am leaning towards buying one outright as I will only be using it to get from A-B. I work 4 days a week and live exactly 5 miles away from work so throwing in a few trips to the shop, gym, socialising etc a week I’d be doing maybe 200-250 miles a month?

Not really bothered about how it looks, the colour, anything really…it would be nice to have modernish tech along the lines of carplay, reversing cameras but not a must have at all. I’m very torn between whether to go cheap and not have a monthly payment over my head or to ‘treat myself’ and get something really nice. I make around £2k a month with around £500 of that right now being bills. I am planning to move out in the next year, however, so I only pay a small amount of rent to my parents right now compared to what I will pay on the market so thats also something I need to take into account - is spending £100’s on a car every month realistic? Insurance also comes into play - cheaper nice cars I’m looking at tend to be more expensive insurance wise and the more expensive cars are cheaper on insurance!! I’ve sat and looked at cars for several hours everyday since I passed and I’m no closer to deciding…do I avoid imports? How many miles is too many? What cars are going to destroy me insurance wise? Should an MOT fail put me off buying a specific car?

Any help is appreciated - apologies for any car related ignorance😅

TLDR: 24M looking for an auto. I have £4k in cash. Unsure whether to buy a cheap banger, mid range decent car, or finance a nice expensive car. Just want something to get from A-B - will only be doing around 200-250 miles a month on average. Know nothing about cars - help!!

Then pick how much road tax you're comfortable paying, keep in mind older cars with expensive tax (200-400£) are generally quite cheap. An example would be a 2011 Lexus is 250 would be like £395 but you're getting an incredibly reliable, incredibly luxurious feeling drive for less than £5k with good mileage. Whereas if you insist on a car like an aygo with £20 road tax, you're paying a similar price which is crazy considering they feel like a tin can. But that's your choice to make.

Next is fuel, I'd say take advantage of the fact that inefficient cars are cheaper, as you're barely doing miles anyway so you won't save much by buying an economical car. Again with the example of Lexus v aygo, you're looking at 30mpg v 50mpg, and roughly 3000 miles a year, you're looking at a grand total saving of like £300. Again more economical cars are generally less nice to drive too, but again, another choice for you to make.

Then of course body type, are you happy with a saloon, or do you need a small car, or an SUV etc. these will massively narrow down your options when searching on auto trader. 

Next is fuel type, if you don't do motorway trips every 2 weeks or so, don't buy a diesel. If you can't charge your car obviously don't buy plug in hybrid or electric lol.

All that should really narrow things down. This is entirely personal, but if I was in your situation and needed a daily driver, I'd look for a 2008-2014 saloon car that's made for comfort like Lexus IS, Passat, Accord, Audi A4, bmw 3 series (these are cheaper than the rest but do require a bit more maintenance). All the above are available in automatic under 5k under 100k miles on Autotrader. But that's just my opinion 🤷

Sure, it can be slightly restrictive, but the disadvantages are decreasing over time anyway (since electric cars all count as automatic, and people are tending to buy more automatics anyway).

I believe you'll need to source a Sport trim level steering wheel with the cruise control and there may be some sort of wiring to do with the brake pedal.

In response to one of your other comments, removing the steering wheel is extremely easy, it should just be 3 bolts and removing a connector or two."
1opt1ex,I've always been sensible...but.,"My fellow petrol heads, I come to you for moral vehicular guidance. I've always been sensible with money, never really made a lot, but Ive always spent it wisely. I think a childhood of money worries has made me like this.

1opsx7e,V5C Incorrectly Showing Category S After Plate Transfer. What Can I Do?,"Hi all,

I’ve recently gone to sell my car, but noticed that the V5C now states it as a Category S write-off — which is incorrect.

What I think has happened is this:
My previous car was written off by my insurer, and it had a private plate on it. I later transferred that same plate onto my current vehicle. It looks like the insurer has incorrectly marked my current car as Cat S because of the registration plate rather than the VIN.

The car has never been in an accident or written off, so this is clearly an error, but I’m stuck with a V5C that says otherwise right as I’m trying to sell it.

Has anyone dealt with this before? Who should I be contacting — DVLA, my insurer, or both? Any advice on how to get this corrected quickly would be massively appreciated.

Thanks!",2,1762415326.0,3,CartalkUK,1762544060,2025-11-06 07:48:46,2025-11-07 19:34:20,"Los-Skeletos (Score: 2): You will likely be able to get it corrected by contacting the DVLA.

Don't bother with the insurer. The issue has come from who issued the V5c - the DVLA.

Budget: around £11k
Mileage target: preferably <70k
Year: 2019+ preferably 

Use case:
	•	I have a toddler, so I need space for the stroller (pram) + car seat + groceries.
	•	I work from home mostly, but I need to do nursery dropoffs / pickups.
	•	Weekends I want to take him to parks, general leisure stuff, maybe once in a while driving to some long distance from Manchester to London.
	•	Mostly just the two of us. Maybe an occasional passenger.
	•	Reliability is the MOST important. I don’t want to deal with major engine problems, or expensive maintenance soon. 

I had reserved a Honda Civic 2021 1.0 Turbo, loved it, amazing boot…
BUT I cancelled after learning about the wet belt issues on that engine. That scared me off. This is the kind of thing I want to avoid 

Then I thought of the 1.5 Civic but that’s like £3-4k more. At that point maybe I should just go Toyota (Corolla etc).

I briefly looked at small SUVs but I didn’t like how they drove or looked inside. Thinking Mazda 3 maybe is better?

I don’t know much about German options… they look more expensive and maybe less reliable long-term, but if I slightly stretch budget you can list options there too. I like how they look, but here I need your expertise, as always drove Japanese there are good.

So what would you choose in this range for reliability + practicality?
	•	Toyota Corolla?
	•	Honda Civic 1.5?
	•	Mazda 3?

	•	Something else I haven’t considered?

Would love real-world experience, especially I need something that just works without stress.

Thanks!
