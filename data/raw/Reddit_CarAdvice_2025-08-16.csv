1mrerg1,"Looking to buy a cheapy cheapy car, need some advice","I found a Chevy Cruze on Facebook Marketplace and the seller is asking $2200 CAD for it (probably a bit over a G USD with the current conversion rate). The car looks decent overall but the AC is broken.

I want to know what I should be looking at when checking this car out in person. How much could it potentially cost to repair the AC. Is this something that is usually a minor fix or can it be a very expensive problem. Is there any other problems I should be on the lookout for?

I am also wondering if it would make sense to try to lowball the seller because of the AC issue or if $2200 is already fair?

Now tighten it until it breaks- pay attention to how the pressure feels as the bolt stretches and breaks. Do several bolts of different sizes and types Metric class 5, class 10, and class 12 SAE grade 5 vs Grade 8 bolts. Tighten hose clamps until they start to squeeze the rubber out and stop- one thing i learned is tighter on hose clamps is better than looser- id rather have an overtightend clamp than a loose one. dont overthink it- pay careful attention to important safty bolts like brake calipers/ brackets, lug nuts, suspension components, bearings, steering- things that could cause someone to get hurt.

1mrawze,Transmission issue only during one certain event,"2000 Subaru outback 2.5 auto. I replaced my transmission a few years ago with a junkyard donor because my last one sucked up the front diff fluid into the tranny and burnt up. 

The newer trans came with miniscule warranty..... to be expected from a junkyard but to even be eligible for the warranty they wanted me to replace all outter seals, the inner shaft seal and inner filter. Also came with the torque converter from this trans fin the donor car. I was kinda on a budget..... had the thought to just buy a new/ refurbed one but it was lower miles from mine and the fluid didn't seem terrible. 

Transmission has been better than the old one, shifts better and softer but lately I've been noticing issues only when sitting in hot weather, idling for long periods of time. A few months ago it was even hotter outside then today in a drive thru and it was stumbling on the way out but after getting on through the parking lot it was fine.... has been fine. 

Today I was in probably the longest and worst traffic due to a semi accident, in a long time that I can remember with this newer trans and the car in general. 

Never did I see the A/T over temp light come on today or at any time this issue has occurred the few times it has. But after sitting a while idling, evening putting it in neutral while sitting, put it in drive and it was stumbling on very light load, RPMs shoot up periodically acting like slippage. Only other thing I noticed was hitting the gas like we're moving to driving speed, would go away after picking up speed. 

I'm a mechanic but don't really fool with transmission unless it's a filter/ fluid change or a complete swap. Definitely been trying to learn more about them, diagnosing and signs but to me this seems like maybe the torque converter might be the issue.

The newer transmission has about 65k on it since putting in, fluid was dumped and filled twice since then, external filter has been replaced twice and have a new one I was setting up to replace 2 oil changes from now at 380k on the car.

1mr9h6z,Battery/Alternator question,"Weird stuff.  Wife has a 2023 Mazda CX-30 with 31k miles.  Two days ago when she went to start it, we noticed a ""slow crank"", as if the battery was drained/low, but the car DID start and drove normally.  At the next stop (grocery store), she attempted to start the car and it wouldn't crank at all.  She called me and I took my jump pack up, connected it, and the car fired right up.

I instructed her to follow me to the local Autozone, where I asked them to test the battery.  Staff said the battery tested fine, but also had us restart the car to check the alternator.  He said the alternator was putting out about 2V lower than expected, and that was likely the culprit.

OK, makes sense...alternator is weak and putting insufficient power back into the battery when driving --> battery eventually drains --> here we are.

Called the dealer (since it is still under warranty) and they informed us they could get it in for a diagnostic in THREE WEEKS.  So that's awesome.

I get the bright idea to connect the car to my trickle charger for several hours to get some power back into the battery, then perhaps it might be OK for a few starts, and I can just keep loading it back up overnight, npnp and carry the jump pack for emergencies.

Here's the weird part though...I had it on the charger for like 16 hours and the charger was indicating the battery was at 50%.  I hopped in to start it, and it's behaving the same way it did when completely dead.  No crank, interior lights go out when attempting to start, etc.  I was at least expecting SOMETHING, even at 50% state of charge.

This leads me to believe it could be the battery, even though the tester said it passed.  I'd rather not spend $200 on a battery to put in it if that isn't the issue (only to have the new one fail as well), but I'm 2.5 weeks from the dealer diagnostic.  In the interim, wife is driving my Tesla and I'm on my motorcycle, which isn't ideal with some inclement weather coming.

With a multimeter you can get a pretty good idea what's going on.  They are $10 to $20 at Harbor Freight. You should have 12v or a bit more across the battery terminals with everything off.  Watch the voltage while someone tries to start the car.  It will drop, but so long as it stays above about 10.5v while the starter works its OK.  If it cranks slow at 10.5v, then the battery is weak.  If the voltage drops way down, the battery is shot.  If it doesn't drop at all, the starter isn't working, or not being told to work (wiring problem in the car).

Once the engine is running, you should see 13.5v to 14.5v.  If it is lower, turn on the headlights to create a load  Some cars have ""smart"" regulators that reduce output from the alternator if there is no load. If voltage goes down a bit with the engine running when you turn on the lights, that suggests an alternator problem. If the serpentine belt is loose or oily, the alternator may not spin properly, that would reduce its output.

1mr8mlj,"Title: No Rear Brake or Turn Signals — Running Lights & Trailer Plug Work — ’07 Ram 3500 (5.9, G56)","Hey all — sorry for a long post but need some advice/HELP

I’ve been chasing a brutal electrical issue on my 2007 Dodge Ram 3500 (Mega Cab, 6.5 ft bed, 5.9 Cummins, G56 manual, built Dec 2006). Here’s what’s going on:

⸻

🔧 Problem
	•	Rear brake lights and turn signals don’t work — both sides. Randomly quite didn’t fluctuate or one goes out then the other both at the same time
	•	Rear running lights DO work when headlights are on.
	•	Trailer plug works — I get proper turn signal and running light output at both the 6-pin and 4-pin.
	•	No power to blinker/brake pins at the tail light bulb sockets both sides — just power to the middle pin (running light) when headlights are on.

⸻

🧪 What I’ve Checked / Done
	•	Replaced all bulbs with new, verified working ones.
	•	Checked C7 connector (driver front frame rail, near wheel well) — I get 12V blinking for both turn signals there when signals are active.
	•	Continuity and voltage test passed at the rear harness entry point (just before it runs back under the bed).
	•	Verified ground points, cleaned them, no visible corrosion.
	•	Loom is tight, continuous from TIPM to rear bumper — no obvious signs of damage or breaks.
	•	Trailer plug reads proper voltage for signals, which means TIPM and feed up to that point are good.

⸻

Theory
It seems like the problem is somewhere between the trailer plug junction and the rear tail light plugs — likely a hidden junction, splice, or connector I can’t see or find.

I’ve heard there might be a final split behind the driver side tail light (where it branches to passenger side + trailer plug), but I can’t find any additional connector or splice point — just continuous loom.

⸻

My Questions
	•	Is there a known splice or junction point between the trailer plug and the tail light sockets that fails on these trucks?
	•	Anyone have a photo, diagram, or exact location of the rear-most connection (other than the tail light plugs themselves)?

On your Accord, the AC engages an idle-up valve (or solenoid) to slightly raise engine speed so the compressor doesn’t bog the motor down. If the vacuum line to this valve is damaged or disconnected, or if the valve itself is sticking open, it can cause a huge idle jump like you’re seeing. The harder stopping with AC on is probably because the vacuum leak is also affecting your brake booster, reducing braking assist. The fix is to inspect the small vacuum hose running from the intake manifold to the AC idle-up valve and brake booster, replace any cracked or broken lines, and clean or replace the idle-up valve if it’s stuck. Once the leak is sealed and the valve works correctly, the idle should only bump up slightly with AC on, and your brakes will feel normal again 👍

PipoSoup (Score: 2): Your ac toggle is connected to your idle control, most likely the diaphragm or valve. It will help supply the vehicle with the correct amount of vacuum so if it's faulty it'll make it hard to brake. Anyone correct me if I'm wrong, hope it helps"

1mredq9,2012 Hyundai Veloster (Auto/manual)— Overheating issue.,"Hi everyone, this is a used car that has been purchased that i’ve had for about 2 months now and I’m not sure where this problem lies. Before, sometimes when idling the car would begin overheating. It would cool down by being driven/turning the car off and sitting. 

Today, on the way home from walmart, I tried to speed up to 70 on the highway and it did, however my rpms shot up to 6 and nearly redlined (the max I’ve ever seen it before is 4 when speeding up) when getting off the highway and trying to speed back up to 70 on my road home (the speed limit), it maxed itself out at 55. I figured I had accidentally bumped it to manual, but no, it was still in automatic. I went ahead and pulled over and so my partner began driving, and then we saw it begin overheating, so we pulled back over, turned the car off, turned it back on to check and the coolant was nearly maxed out, and so we turned it back off and popped the hood to let it cool off. 

Their father came to check on us and we let it sit for about 15 minutes to cool off and then turned it back on to check the temperature and it had cooled down properly. We were 4 miles away from home so we went ahead to try and drive it home and it did properly, speeding up, slowing down, everything worked. However, their father noted that whenever the  car idled(to slow down) there were small amounts of steam coming from the exhaust, and when accelerating, large amounts came out. 

Prior to this the oil has been changed, the water reservoir is full, i havent checked the radiator/coolant yet (im letting it cool down all the way), the thermostat has been replaced, and fans are turning on, i just want some help figuring out why this could be happening. Thank you!!! ",1,1755301315.0,2,CarHelp,1755372828,2025-08-15 23:41:55,2025-08-16 19:33:48,"Gunner_862 (Score: 2): Hi,

If the car was only staying cool when in motion, the radiator fan may be not working, which would cause it to overheat when not moving very fast.

If the engine was allowed to overheat too much, it can warp aluminum components of the engine like the cylinder head, causing the cylinder head gasket to fail. When the gasket fails, coolant can enter the engine and be burnt off as white steam coming out of the exhaust. I'm not saying this is indeed the case, but just my guess based on the info you have given. 

Cooling system would have to be checked for the presence of combustion gasses, as well as an engine compression test to verify a diagnosis like this. Hope this helps!"

Tom Wood Subaru verified it themselves, telling me that they've had complaints for at least ten years and that they have no intention of ever fixing it, since people now play music from online sources.    
  
Here's the thing  I have 50 years worth of music, albums, stuff off the radio that I have in specific orders, stuff recorded on hand held recorders from back in the day.  Some of this I can't even get off of an online service if I wanted to.  Tom Wood told me I could download my flashdrives onto a Youtube account for free and then play them in the car through Android Auto.  However after spending a decent amount of time on Youtube I can't find any way to do what he said.

1.  Can you play flashdrives in your car, and do they screw up the order or play them normally?  If normal, what year and model is your car?  
  
2.  If you have a music library that you access through Android Auto, what services are you using, and what did you use to download your music to it?

Double check that when you bought it, if you purchased an extended warranty. If you did, that’ll help! Call the dealership with that information and ask if they can work with said extended warranty.

1mqyayt,I felt so stressed after seeing my car get messed up by a friend's oil change.,"Here's what happened: I'm an international student and bought a used car. After being in the US for a while, I felt it was important to gain some experience in car repair. So I asked a friend to change my oil. I wanted to observe and learn everything there was to know, like where to put the jack and the various parts of a car. I trusted my friend because he'd successfully changed my oil and brake pads before. However, this time, there was a minor mishap. The first time, my friend changed the oil, he didn't remove the rubber seal from the oil filter, causing oil to spray out when I started the car. The second time, the check engine light came on, saying low oil pressure, so he added more oil. Perhaps he added too much oil, because when I got home, I noticed it was burning oil, with a lot of white smoke coming out of the rear engine. The next day, I went to a repair shop to change the oil and clean the engine again, but they told me there might be some problem with the turbo engine. It's too complex for them to handle, so they didn't recommend continuing driving the car and suggested towing it to a dealership for repairs. My car has been at the dealership for three days with no response, and I haven't driven it in a week. I've been anxious these past few days, worried about the high repair costs and serious aftereffects. Now that I need a car, I've rented one: Besides the rental fee, there's also a hefty young adult fee. In addition, I know that I have to take the main responsibility for letting my friends change the oil and repair the car.

It might be better to look at some YouTube videos to get some tips on how to do it.  Maybe that will address your curiosity.  It is also far less dangerous or expensive.

So back to your engine.  IF he in fact did overfill your oil, hopefully you noted or saw that on the dipstick, then here is what I'd expect to hear from the shop.

First, your turbo is not likely damaged, but most turbo cars have intercoolers and overfilling with oil may have forced some excess oil into the intercooler through the crankcase ventilation system.   The shop will need to remove the intercooler and dump/clean out the excess oil to address the smoke issue.  

Now if the current dealer shop is not fully aware of the events leading up to this situation, they might well diagnose a turbo failure and give you a turbo replacement estimate of several thousand dollars.  IF the vehicle happens to be a BMW it might be a really big number.  Replacing the turbo will fix the issue as you remove the intercooler in the process and would notice the oil and clean it out.  IF you current oil level is correct, you could ask some other shop to check your intercooler and clean it out.  I would do that step WAY before I would spring for a new turbo as there is nearly zero chance the events you described ruined your turbo.  No zero, but close to zero.

The trip was stop and go on back roads when I started smelling brakes. Two more stop and starts and I noticed brake fade and the left front making a noise (sort of like when you let off the brakes just enough for the car to start moving again -very similar to that noise.) one time the pedal got soft (was still not quite at a safe stop point)

I pulled over and noticed the hub cap was starting to melt in a couple places, I could feel heat coming off of the wheel after I ripped the hubcap off.

Let it sit for over an hour, cold to the touch, then did 8mph the whole next 3 miles to home. Didn't feel bad\\hot at all upon getting home, never felt it dragging either, must have been just enough to keep a little contact.

I replaced the caliper, brake hose (because I think fluid boiled), and fluid.

My husband does most our car maintenance and repairs but doesn't always have the tools needed so occasionally we go to a shop.

We have been using this mechanic for 15+ years with no issues. (A National brand) They were never pushy, they didn't try to upsell unnecessary services and we never had to take a vehicle back after getting something fixed, it was always done correctly the first time. They were the type of mechanics that when changing your water pump, they would notice unrelated issues or wear and tear and let you know that ""hey this belt or coil etc, is looking worn. You have maybe X amount of miles before you'll need to replace that and it's going to cost this much. And they were usually right.

Around two years ago, they moved to a location that was a lot further for us to drive so we started going to a local mechanic who was right down the street from us. The local mechanic recently retired and closed his shop so when it was time to get one of our vehicles inspected for license plate renewal, we went back to our old shop. 

I took it in for the inspection and upon arrival I noticed that I did not recognize the front desk employee or any of the mechanics. This would not have been the first staff change this place had though so I wasn't super worried about it since I always had great service here. They completed the inspection and told me they were only two things that needed to be done but they didn't have time to do it today so we scheduled it. Well my husband took it back to get those two things fixed a week later. When he went in, the front desk person was a completely different person from the one I had just scheduled everything with.

While it was being worked on, he was just talking to the newer front desk person and asked about the passenger door being stuck shut and we were looking for ways to get it open without breaking the door panel on the inside. 

Well fast forward a few weeks, after life happened and we remembered that we needed to get it inspected again after the repairs. I took it back in for and when the front desk guy pulls up my account and I tell him why I'm there he immediately says that my vehicle is guaranteed to fail the inspection after what my husband told him. So I said to him that I already had it inspected and you guys are the ones that fixed the issues of why it failed so it should pass just fine. And it did. And honestly that was the start of my issues with this place. It kind of pissed me off but I just let it slide since he was new and didn't know our vehicle.

So now my other vehicle is having two separate issues simultaneously. 

1st issue is it was completely dead every time we try to start it. We had to jump it every time. Took the battery to get tested and it came back as good. 

2nd issue, it was not wanting to accelerate when you press on the gas and then all of a sudden it goes. It was pulling up a code for camshaft sensor. My husband can replace this easily but since we're going to take it into the shop for the first issue anyway, we wanted them to check it out and make sure it wasn't anything else.

So we take it and drop it off. They called us and said that for the acceleration issue they couldn't duplicate it while test driving but the only code they were pulling was the camshaft sensor so we declined for them to do that service. 

The 1st issue they said was because the alternator was bad and that the battery cables and connections were worn. So my husband looked up the engine diagram see if he could get to the alternator to change it himself since he has experience from our other vehicles. He did not have all the tools necessary to get to it because you have to take off the tire and the wheel well. 

So he called them back and told him to go ahead and replace the alternator and the battery connectors. 

We got it back same day and parked it in the driveway.

The morning after, I get in it to leave and it's completely dead. Husband came out, popped the hood to put our jumper on it and noticed that the battery connectors were very loose and not even connected all the way down. So he fixed that and then jumped the car. While I was driving I noticed that the steering wheel was very tight and it was not like that before we dropped it off to have the service done. And every time we have tried to start it after being fixed, we have had to jump it.

He took it back in and told them the issues and now they are calling back and saying that our battery is bad and the tensioner for the serpentine belt needs to be replaced. And also said they don't know why the steering wheel is tight and they would need to charge for an hour diagnostics to see what the issue is. So I told them no, the steering was fine before we dropped it off for you to fix the alternator. When they took off the wheel or something they did something to make the steering wheel too tight.

So from the engine diagram and YouTube videos we have watched, to replace the alternator they would have had to take the serpentine belt off. Why did they not notice that the tensioner was also bad and why did they not notice that the battery connectors were worn? Why was that not part of the diagnostics of why we kept having to jump the vehicle? Is testing the battery first and checking that entire system not part of diagnostics? Did they jump to the most expensive possibility first?

Is this how mechanics operate? I feel like we're being screwed over and it's costing me a lot of extra money in this economy.

Batteries should be fully charged with replacement alternators. Also, the terminals being loose will cause your issues with having to jump the car every time it is turned off. 

Yes, they have to remove the belt for the alternator. Most of these national branded places have rookies straight out of these tech schools working there. They have limited experience.

Anyone experience this sound? Every time I accelerate, it only happens when in gear, not while in park, especially when it's like a soft acceleration, pressing a bit, well under load, especially when coasting and then applying a little bit of pressure on the gas pedal.(video here)⏬️

Seems anything under 4000 rpm while feathering the gas pedal, I can hear it louder. I don't know what it is; it's hard to explain. It's kind of like a tin can sound. I'm bringing it back to the dealer.

I've included a photo of the work order they did, but the minute I left the shop, the sound was still there. They're not helpful on most occasions; I get sent home and pay for diagnostics.

Are you using premium fuel?  What is happening is the lower octane fuel tends to ignite too early, pushing the piston back down and creating a knock/rattle. The computer uses a knock sensor and when it detects the noise it retards the ignition timing, that's why it only happens for a second or two when you accelerate and then it stops once the computer adjusts the timing, but retarded timing means the engine power output is going to be reduced. Higher octane (octane rating=anti knock rating)fuels don't preignite as easily and so the timing is advanced by the computer and it produces more power. 

Brief spark knock is considered acceptable. It says so in the owners manual under ""fuel."" Mid grade 89 is recommended for the GT, and premium fuel will usually eliminate it entirely."

1mqirkj,"Engine head, intake valve small leak?","I’m in process of replacing a head gasket for my wife’s 2013 Prius. I’ve tested the head with a machined straight edge and a feeler gauge and there is no reason to re surface the head. 

However, I used break cleaner to test the valve seals on all valves, and found all were okay except the two intake valves on cylinder 3. (A cylinder 1 misfire is what prompted this repair). 

The car is already at 200k miles, and we probably don’t plan on getting any more than 35-40k more miles out of it before buying a new car, it may even be as little as 10k miles. That being said we’re trying to keep this fix on a tight budget. 

I’m quoted at $250 to re build and clean the head. With only cylinder 3 intake valves leaking (tested by spraying brake cleaner on the top side of the valve, I’m not even sure how accurate this is because I’m just going off forums and YouTube ) would it be worth the repair? Anyone think the car can make it that far? If we don’t fix the leaky valve, what’s the worst that could happen?

Firstly if the head is that straight, why was a repair needed? Was the gasket deformed? Did it show evidence of being blown? Was a compression test done before stripping it?

Secondly, at 200K miles, removing and refitting the head comes with the risk of disturbing the rings and causing the engine to smoke / burn oil after the repair. Unwise to do half a rebuild on a motor with that many miles. 

If I walked in on that job now I would just lap the leaking valves if nothing was visible in the seats and not too much play in the valve guides, put it back together and drive it. Ensure the gasket kit comes with valve guide seals.

1mr5iye,I Got Ripped Off?,"I live in the UK. 
From when I passed my test in 2023 until this past June, I was driving a car provided to me by the Motability Scheme (a brand new car paid for by benefits.)
In June, my benefit was taken away from me and I had to give the car back. I was scrambling to find another car, and as I’m limited to automatic cars my selection wasn’t as vast. 

I bought a 2013 Citroen C4 from a dealer my mother knew and had bought her car from. The car cost £2,500 and the dealer put it through MOT and replaced the belts and filters. 
However, there were a multitude of issues with the car. 
- The seatbelt sensors would beep despite there being no one in the seats. 
- The drivers side window rolled further down when you tried to roll it up. 
- The car sputtered quite a lot and there was a very noticeable delay in acceleration. 
There’s many more things, but those are the major issues. 

I needed a change, as the car was driving me crazy. So after two months of having it I shopped around and found a beautiful 2014 Hyundai i30. 
I tried to trade in the Citroen only to be told it was worth next to nothing because the gearbox was about to shit itself.

I took it to a shop and they diagnosed it and told me the catalytic converter was indeed bad and needed to be changed but there were no after market parts for my car so they bought an OEM Cat from the dealer and changed it. Then they told me the check engine light went away but the car is still accelerating poorly.. They told me that my flex pipe was also very damaged and that they didnt notice it before and said that it was from the engine mount being worn out and moving too much. They blamed the poor acceleration on the flex pipe. The engine mount was indeed moving too much and I am not surprised because the car has 100k on it already. They changed the flex pipe and the engine mount. The car is still not accelerating properly.. $3600 later and the car is still not working how it should.

They are saying that when they drive the car like normal and put in more than a little bit of throttle the RPMS shoot high up and the car lurches back and stays stuck and doesn't shift gears. They told me that when they drive the car in Manual mode with the shifttronic, the RPMs dont get stuck but the car is still not accelerating.

To find a free GM radio unlock code, you'll need to obtain a six-digit code from your radio and then use it to contact a GM dealer or an online service that provides the four-digit unlock code. You can get the six-digit code by pressing preset buttons 1 and 4 (or 2 and 3 if you don't have a fourth) for ten seconds, then pressing the AM/FM button. After that, you can contact a GM dealer or use an online service to get the four-digit unlock code. "

I pumped the cooling system to 15 psi and found that one hose was leaking. Depressurized the system, then adjusted the hose, then pumped it back to 15 psi. The hose was no longer leaking. But I heard noise at the radiator cap, where the pressure tester connection was.

1mrbdne,Mechanic can't seem to figure out why my Elantra GT can't accelerate.,"So for awhile now my 2018 Elantra GT (115K miles) has been driving very sluggish and it wouldn't go up any hills and would barely come up to highway speeds. There was a P0420 check engine code that points to a bad catalytic converter. I took it to a shop and they diagnosed it and told me the catalytic converter was indeed bad and needed to be changed but there were no after market parts for my car so they bought an OEM Cat from the dealer and changed it. Then they told me the check engine light went away but the car is still accelerating poorly.. They told me that my flex pipe was also very damaged and that they didnt notice it before and said that it was from the engine mount being worn out and moving too much. They blamed the poor acceleration on the flex pipe. The engine mount was indeed moving too much and I am not surprised because the car has 100k on it already. They changed the flex pipe and the engine mount. The car is still not accelerating properly.. $3600 later and the car is still not working how it should.

They are saying that when they drive the car like normal and put in more than a little bit of throttle the RPMS shoot high up and the car lurches back and stays stuck and doesn't shift gears. They told me that when they drive the car in Manual mode with the shifttronic, the RPMs dont get stuck but the car is still not accelerating.

What could be wrong with my car? I told them I am just going to pick up my car and take it for now because I already spent so much on it to be ""fixed"" and still have problems.

1mrbb5q,Help please,"2003 Toyota Tacoma 2.4L 2RZ-FE, manual — sudden mid-drive shutdown, now no-start

•	Driving normally, no bumps, no sputter — engine instantly died to 0 RPM.
•	Would not bump start in 2nd.
•	Cranks strong but will not start
•	Found ECU-IG fuse blown.
•	Replaced fuse → blew again.
•	Disconnected aftermarket head unit → fuse stopped blowing.
•	Even with fuse staying good, still no start.

What we tried so far:
•	Sprayed starter fluid directly into intake manifold → no start (makes me think not fuel-related).
•	EFI relay tested good (and replaced anyway).
•	ECU swapped into another Tacoma → worked fine there.
•	Fuel pump replaced — getting power, but no priming sound; removed banjo bolt → no fuel came out.
•	Could not find C/OPN relay anywhere under the dash.
•	Battery replaced with Optima Yellow Top (negative terminal now loose).
•	New alternator installed.
•	New crankshaft position sensor (CKP) installed.
•	New camshaft position sensor (CMP) installed.
•	Ignition switch replaced.
•	All grounds cleaned (some minor rust under block grounds).
•	After new CKP: tested for spark → no spark.
•	Coils & plugs OEM and only 4 months old.
•	EFI fuse & other relevant relays confirmed good.
•	OBD2 port not getting enough power to read codes.

Noticed:
•	Loose negative battery terminal on new battery (wasn’t loose on old battery).
•	Cranking sounds weaker/different now than at first.
•	No visible arcing in daylight while cranking.

What we think now:
•	Possibly two separate issues:
	1.	Original mid-drive stall = short in head unit wiring blew ECU-IG fuse → killed ignition signal.
	2.	Current no-start may be worsened by loose battery clamp causing voltage drop.
•	But still no spark even with new CKP/CMP, alternator, ignition switch.
•	Might be ECU not sending IGT signal to coils or igniter failure.
• We tried backprobing the ECU IGT 1 2 3 and 4 pins and IGF to see if ECU was commanding spark, nothing light up while cranking but ECU battery wire is hot so it is getting power. Check ECU grounds next?

Given all this, what’s the next best test? Any input would be greatly appreciated, we’ve been trying to fix it for almost a month now and no luck. Thanks guys!!!

It sounds like it's not opening properly, which means your engine cannot accelerate.  A/C puts a load on your car, and if it is turned on in this state, the engine RPMs ""go crazy"" as it's too much load for the low RPMs.  

The ""TPS"" Autozone error also points this way.  Do you have the P code from Autozone?  

Here's a video on [testing the throttle body](https://youtu.be/IZoEbJrSJXo), but it requires a tool you probably don't have.  A visual inspection of the throttle body and maybe cleaning it (look at the video to see gunk building up on it).  

Finally, intermittent problems are hard to troubleshoot.  You could fire the parts shotgun (new TB) at it, only to find it's actually a broken wire leading to the TB that causes this, or the potentiometer on the gas pedal isn't working...

Vehicle: 2006 Nissan Xterra – VQ40DE 4.0L V6

⸻

Timeline of Events:

First Purchase Attempt:
	•	Bought the vehicle from a private seller. Seller told me he swapped in a different used engine and did a timing chain service himself.
	•	4 miles into driving it home, the check engine light started flashing and there was significant white smoke from the exhaust (smelled like oil, not coolant).
	•	At some stops, the engine shook noticeably.
	•	Returned the vehicle, seller refunded me.

Seller’s “Fix” and Second Purchase:
	•	Same day, seller said he found a broken mounting tab on the crankshaft position sensor and replaced it. Claimed he drove it 28 miles afterward with no issues.
	•	I bought it again.

Second Drive Home:
	•	12 miles in, CEL started flashing again. Engine ran progressively rougher and smoke increased.
	•	Pulled over; CEL went away temporarily.
	•	Shortly after, it wouldn’t shift out of gear properly, RPMs stayed high.
	•	After cooling down, it wouldn’t go above ~1000 RPM or ~5 mph. Had to tow it home.

⸻

Current Condition:
	•	Very difficult to start. If it does start, it runs extremely rough.
	•	Mechanic noted “excessive blow-by” from the oil cap, intake manifold, and throttle body.

⸻

OBD-II Codes Recorded Over Time:
	•	P0011 – “A” Camshaft Position Timing Over-Advanced Bank 1
	•	P0340 & P0345 – Camshaft Position Sensor “A” Circuit (Bank 1 & Bank 2)
	•	P0335 – Crankshaft Position Sensor “A” Circuit
	•	P0300 & P0301 – Random/multiple misfire and Cylinder 1 misfire
	•	P0420 & P0430 – Catalyst efficiency below threshold (both banks)
	•	P0455 & P0441 – EVAP system codes (possibly unrelated)

1mr69h7,Honda Dealership Scam?,"Hey guys, Good Morning! 🦭👍🏽

So I’m taking my 2022 Accord Touring 2.0T into my local Houston Dealership because I’m getting the same symptoms you would typically get with a failing CV axle, in my case the passenger side CV Axle it seems

Symptoms like

1. Vibration at idle
2. Clicking, popping, metal groaning noises when turning right, although sometimes it happens when turning left
3. Hesitation at launch when accelerating, something that would happen with uneven power distribution between the front wheels
4. The car doesn’t feel planted at highway speeds and definitely not in the rain, at highway speeds on a normal day it feels like the car gets pushed around left and right laterally by high speed winds even though there’s no significant wind out that day, and even if there were, the car moves laterally regardless of the direction that im going in, as if the wing was ALWAYS hitting the left and right side perfectly at all times, in the rain it feels like the car is very light, like it’s on the brink of loosing traction and hydroplaning at 60 MPH and although my tires are not performance tires, I didn’t have this issue with my old 2022 Touring 2.0T that was totaled which had non-performance tires 

For context my car is still covered under the powertrain warranty which expires in my case on March 2027 or at 60,000 miles, which I’m well under at 33,000 miles

The dealership did the diagnostic over the course of 3 days and told me on the phone that they found that I had a “bad motor mount” which is suspicious because, WHICH motor mount? There’s 5 of them on the 10th gen Honda Accord as far as I’m aware of

In any case, I’m leaning towards just paying for their diagnostic and taking my car back and replacing the lower front, back and upper passenger side motor mounts with PRL and PLM performance parts, what do you guys think?

1mr60g9,16 vw Jetta stuck in limp mode!! Please help,"Hello, I have a 2016 vw Jetta that went into limp mode and I can not figure out how to get it out of limp mode.

So my mechanic buddy is saying I need a abs module.

Take this into a shop and get the problems diagnosed properly

Something has failed and is causing your engine to be in limp mode, only reason it goes there is because it knows there is something wrong and doesn't want to rev high

To my knowledge none of what you've replaced should cause limp mode, unless your o2 was seriously gummed up and your cat was clogged, maybe something in the ESP system"

1mr3rct,Need some professional advice!,"Okay so I have a doozy of an ordeal with a mechanic that I want to get some advice on from some experts here because courts about to get involved and wanted to see what everyone thinks about this situation:

In March, I was working on my vehicle replacing the water pump because it had a tiny leak going on. Easy repair, nothing I couldn't normally handle but upon removing the pump, a bolt had broken and part of the stud remained stuck in the engine block. I tried for days and every method possibly to remove the bolt to no success. I call a guy who does house calls, and he came out and looked at it and said if I brought it to his shop he could take care of it.  So I put everything back together, and drove it to his shop. 

After a few weeks of back and forth we realized the bolt was not going to come out and the best solution was to replace the timing cover completely. I approved that repair, for $1800 and he got to work on it. After reassembling everything, he started the engine and it locked up. He told me that the timing chain was messed up and when he started it, the pistons blew out. The timing chain and everything was fine befor eI dropped it off because I drove it there with no issues. Despite me knowing the work he did was the cause of the chain failure and the pistons blowing out, I approved another quote for 2200 to replace the pistons. At this point it had already been two months of him having it and barely communicating during that time so I just wanted it fixed and be done with it. Well after another month or so he told me that everything was good to go and he was going to test drive i t and then have it back to me by the time I got back from a trip I was on. Bare in mind this is now 140 days of him having the vehicle.

Well, after he test drove it, the engine locked up again, and this time he said that the engine spun a bearing, and now he's quoted an additional $4500 dollars to completely replace the engine. I had enough and told him I was going to tow the vehicle to another shop because I do not think he is competent in what he is doing and he's had nearly 6 months with the vehicle and he has basically destroyed my engine by this point. He is claiming all of these things are existing issues that had nothing to do with the work he had done.  Well, I told him its best if we part ways, tow it somewhere else and then we should both just cut our loses and move on. Now he is holding the vehicle ransom until I pay the original 2200 and then he would put the vehicle back together. He said he couldn't move it currently because he had removed the engine completely, which was something I did NOT approve and it was just his way of diagnosing the new issue with the bearing. He also changed the original quote that I approved for the 2200 to a completely different repair for 4500 for the engine rebuild that says I approved that, which I did NOT approve. I have text messages discussing the original quote for 2200.

So, am I crazy in thinking that he caused this whole ordeal? I feel like he has been gaslighting me this whole time and is avoiding all responsibility for what was obviously botching the timing cover replacement and has ruined my engine in the process. I refuse to pay 2200 more on top of the already 1800 just to get my vehicle back with a busted engine, which it was brought in to remove a bolt.  

His communication has been non-existent unless I messaged him and he has gone weeks with zero updates or photos or anything he promised he would send me to show the progress.

So what are my options here? Any advice on how to go about resolving this?  I have an attorney ready to take on the case but wanted to see what my chances are of getting my jeep back without paying that insane repair bill, and possibly get him to foot the bill to have the engine repaired at a different shop with a quality repair person. I am tempted to just pay him the 2200 just to get it back so I can tow it to a different shop to access the damage he has done but also don't want to negotiate with what is an incompetent person basically extorting money out of me with endless repairs.",1,1755277410.0,3,AskMechanics,1755372828,2025-08-15 17:03:30,2025-08-16 19:33:48,redoilokie (Score: 1): I hope he's insured.
1mr3frk,Hydrocarbon Test,"I was driving down the road when suddenly the car started running rough, the check engine light came on, the temperature gauge went up, and eventually the car died. For the past couple of weeks, the AC had been cutting in and out, though that might be unrelated.

I took it to the shop, they charged a diagnostic fee, and told me I had a leaking radiator and a couple leaking gaskets. I approved about $2,000 worth of work to get those fixed.

After they replaced the radiator, they ran into an issue and decided to do a hydrocarbon test, which revealed that the head gasket was blown. If I had known this, I would have not approved of the initial repair work.  When I asked them why they didn’t perform this test before performing repairs, they basically said three things:

1) Doing a hydrocarbon test after finding a radiator leak isn’t standard practice (they even dismissed my friend as a “lawn chair quarterback” for suggesting it).

2) The car wouldn’t run long enough to perform the test.

3) The car was leaking coolant “as fast as they could put it in,” so the test couldn’t be done.

Honestly, it kind of felt like they were just throwing out excuses to see if anything would stick, but I don’t know enough about cars to know if they legitimately had no way of knowing or if they didn’t do their due diligence when diagnosing the issue.",1,1755276731.0,6,AskMechanics,1755372828,2025-08-15 16:52:11,2025-08-16 19:33:48,"xl-Destinyyy-lx (Score: 1): How long were you driving for after the light came on and the temp went up. ‘Eventually the car died’ makes it sounds like you drove it till it gave up instead of pulling over as soon as you could. 

Did you communicate this to the garage properly?

If they are only going off of car temp went up because the radiator leaked, then doing the radiator before anything would be logical.

smokedoutK (Score: 1): I agree with the other response. Communication is big when you bring your vehicle in. In a typical situation, if a car was dropped off for stating a coolant leak and overheating, most techs will recommend addressing the obvious leak(s) at hand. And confirming the repair afterwards. Almost all the vehicles that came to me that I ended up diagnosing a failed head gasket on, came in leaking internally (into the cylinder(s)), smoking, misfiring, and overheating etc. In your case it really seems like your leak(s) led to you driving your car with low or no coolant for an extended time, thus causing the damage to your headgasket.

Entitled clients could ruin a trip even quicker than horrific weather, flooded rivers, or bears ransacking a camp. I had to quit before I completely ruined my love of floating rivers and fly fishing. I still go every summer, but now I’m just “guiding” buddies who help with everything and we all split the cost of the gear and float plane. I’ll never do it for money again."

Im required to write up repair orders, look up the parts, and other things that make doing over 40 hours a week difficult. 

So after realizing things aren't going to get better I decided to leave and look around. I took 2 interviews and got offered 2 jobs. 

One was at another independent shop paying 45/hr with decent benefits and a much better process so I know I would make more than 40 hours a week there. It's a good shop for sure but Ill be doing the same work I've always done. 

The second job is an hourly position that provides a company vehicle and I would ride around and do a much lighter work. Easy work for sure. It pays 70,000 a year salary and great benefits. 

Im torn because on one hand I know I could make more money taking the job in the shop but this other job I would get to learn something new and the work would be easy work.

The vibrations are most noticeable at slow speeds, especially on hills where im braking harder. From the outside the brakes make an interesting gurgling sound sort of like when you have water in your mouth, look down and suck in through your mouth. Not sure if it's a fluid sound or a weird squeak.

Doesn't seem to be calipers considering I just changed them and bled them really well. Usually you'd feel a warped rotor more at high speeds, some im very curious as to what yall think this is. I do have new pads and rotors sitting in the van just in case, as well as the tools to do basically anything I need to.

The back of the inner pads have a thin metal piece that the piston has considerably eaten through, so I believe the vibrations there to be my squeaking sound, but I haven't the darndest clue what the big vibrations are. 

Hoses look good, calipers are brand new, and I had the original pads and rotors swapped back in April so they still have a lot of life in them, as well as a fluid flush, so it's likely not contaminated. Ironically these symptoms all came up after I had the rotors and pads swapped. Everything I have on for braking on the front is Raybestos if that means anything.

1mqmveu,Do you have to time cam phaser as well as the camshaft lobes?,"I’ve just done a timing chain job on a Opel/Vauxhall Meriva. I’ve used the crankshaft locking tool by turning the crankshaft and pushing the bolt until it goes into the locking position.. then I put the camshaft holding tool on the top right of the camshaft lobes. At first it was 180 degrees out, so I turned the crankshaft 180 degrees whilst the crankshaft tool is still in place. Then I was able to get the long bar in to lock the cam lobes in. Both were dead on straight and the bar went in without having to adjust the cams.

I put everything back together after changing the timing chain kit, then cleared all the fault codes and had the crankshaft correlation code come up with the engine light. However, the car is idling a driving really smooth with no chain rattle noises like before.

I was going to take it for a good drive tomorrow and plug the machine in again to see if it’ll go and maybe it just needs a drive?

I’ve also looked at a video on how others changed the timing chain on this and see that some people also used the cam phaser setting tool on the top left, plus the chain guide rail setter?

My question is, if the timing wasn’t out originally, and when setting the timing for the cam lobes, if the bar went straight in and locked it in place, doesn’t that mean the timing is already correct and there’s no need to adjust the camshaft phasers?

I’ve attached 3 photos (the 2 photos with the blue box is the YouTube video screenshot showing how he used the tool on the camshaft phasers. Other photo is of my car.

After 2 more tries it blew the fuse again, and now even with more new fuses, it doesn't crank and it instantly blows the fuse on the first try.

1mrbmev,Why do people hate 'lane hoggers' so much? It seems pretty harmless,"I never did understand why people who drive in lane 2 are hated so much - especially compared to a lot of other more dangerous actions such as phone use or tailgating. People always talk about how much they despise this behaviour when it feels harmless and at most slightly annoying.

To be honest I see why people hog the middle lane, if you are going to be driving at 70 it's a matter of seconds before you encounter another truck and have to try move over. Plus often the first lane will split off into its own exit - on the M25 to stay on the motorway, at one junction, you need lane 4 out of 6. I try keep left as much as possible but my own personal rule is that if I can see a truck I'll stay in lane 2 as I will inevitably pass them very soon. But if I can't see any trucks I'll drive in lane 1.

Also in a lot of other countries it's acceptable to drive in the middle lanes on highways - often the left lane (reversed order as we drive on the left) is the slow lane for trucks, lanes 2 and 3 are for regular traffic to travel and lane 4 is the fast lane for passing. Maybe it should be different?

Overall I can see why hogging lanes is able to be a problem but it seems like people get so riled up over something so small when there are much bigger problems out there. I'd rather someone in a Honda Jazz driving at 65 in lane 2 than someone in their financed Merc doing 100 down the right lane as the Honda Jazz puts nobody in danger.

I mean my point is just why do people get so angry about a mostly harmless bad habit but feel alright with actual dangerous driving?

1mr4nkr,Help with DVLA Licence Exchange – Rejected Multiple Times Despite Full History (Canada → Hong Kong → UK),"Hi all,

Looking for advice or insight if anyone has been through something similar.

My dad is currently trying to exchange his non-GB driving licence for a UK one — specifically, to get a full **Category B** (car) licence. The process has been frustrating and confusing, and we’ve had multiple rejections from the DVLA despite sending full documentation.

# Background:

* My dad originally **passed his driving test in Canada** in the 1980s (British Columbia).
* Years later, when he moved to Hong Kong, he used his Canadian licence for a **Hong Kong licence** (as allowed under their rules).
* He now lives in the UK permanently and is applying to exchange his foreign licence for a GB licence.

# Documents provided:

* Valid **Hong Kong driving licence** (Category 01 and 02 – car and light goods)
* **Canadian driving record** from ICBC (proves full driving entitlement incl. manual)
* **Letter from Hong Kong Transport Dept** confirming licence categories and current address
* **Valid Canadian passport**
* **Immigration share code** (S-code) showing lawful UK residence
* Completed **D1 form** with passport photo and payment
* Multiple **cover letters** explaining the timeline and that the HK licence was obtained via exchange

# DVLA's Response:

DVLA has repeatedly returned the application, saying:

* They believe the Hong Kong licence was **issued in exchange** for a non-designated country (Canada) — which is **not eligible** for UK exchange.
* Because of this, they say they **cannot grant a UK licence**, even though Hong Kong is usually an accepted country for exchange.

We’ve explained this, sent supporting documents twice, and were even told by DVLA not to resend certain ID documents — but they’ve still rejected it.

# My Question:

Is there **any way forward** here other than starting from scratch (provisional + theory + practical test)?

We’re happy to accept **automatic-only** entitlement if it helps, but it seems the root issue is the test being originally done in Canada. Has anyone been successful in a similar case? Is there any workaround or escalation route?

We’ve considered:

* Filing a **formal DVLA complaint**
* Contacting our **MP**
* Exploring whether the **Hong Kong Transport Dept** can confirm in writing that the licence wasn’t exchanged (but we know it was)

Any help, advice, or experience with DVLA’s licence exchange process — especially involving **Canada/Hong Kong** — would be massively appreciated.

Thanks in advance!",5,1755279329.0,1,CartalkUK,1755372828,2025-08-15 17:35:29,2025-08-16 19:33:48,"Kexxa420 (Score: 5): Canada is a designated country. You can exchange a Canadian licence for an UK one. Manual/Automatic restrictions apply. Same like Hong Kong’s.

1mqxbc2,Am I being thick or are these types of products to help with brake/clutch bleeding not fit for purpose?,"Clutch pedal on my wife’s car was being dodgy, checked clutch fluid and was very black. So changed it, pedal felt fine. Then after a couple of days, pedal is doing nothing. Push it to the floor, clutch doesn’t engage, and won’t return up. 

I’m fairly sure it’s just because we did a shit job and got air into the system when changing the fluid. I blame my wife for wanting to get it done asap as she has no patience lol, so I think maybe she lifted the pedal on some occasions when the nipple was open. But also was my first time changing clutch fluid so maybe I don’t know what I was doing too. 

So anyway I bought one of these to just try and bleed it myself. But then I thought, is it even working? It says it has a one way valve, but that is right at the opposite end of the tube that I attach to the nipple. So if I attach this and press clutch, wont fluid/air go into the tube, but then when I lift pedal (at least some) just be sucked back in because it’s still in the tube so can still travel both ways?

* It's been so long that you've now also changed employer and don't even work in the location where the prang happened.
* You've given no information that is an admission of fault, liability, or even that the accident happened.

Honestly, after so long I'd block his number and move on. If he tries to contact his insurance now, based on an accident he had a year ago, which has a high probability of being on a previous annual policy anyway, his insurer is likely just going to laugh at him and tell him to get lost. 

It's not worth them either paying out, or chasing you because of the cost involved, and they're likely just to cancel his policy because he failed to provide them with correct information relating to a previous collision if he admits to them there was one.

As for your current insurer - they're not going to do a thing. They won't be interested in any damge that occured before the date they started to insure you.

All he's trying to do here is intimidate you into parting with cash, and probably wants you to either pay him directly so he can pocket it, or pay for repairs at a garage because there's additional damages to what there were initially.

He's basically chancing it to make some money, and personally, I'd tell him to fuck off, then block his number and get on with my life.

1mqv4yn,Skoda Octavia – could it be ex-rental?,"Hi all,

I’m test driving a used Skoda Octavia this weekend. 1.6 TDI (diesel), 2017 reg, 70k miles, 1 previous owner. It’s on for \~£9.4k. Service history: 4 Skoda services, most recent at 68k miles in January.

**Concerns:**

Looks good so far, but I’m concerned that it might be ex-rental. The advert states “this vehicle is eligible for VAT reclamation for those who purchase through their business”. I don’t plan to do this, but I’ve read that used cars eligible for this are probably ex-company or ex-rental. Is there any truth in that?

I asked the dealership (large and fairly reputable), who said that they have no way of knowing whether it’s ever been used for hire etc.

In addition, I noticed that it has mis-matched tyres in the advert (attached pic). I think 2 x Michelin, 1 x Continental, 1 x Yokohama. Hard to tell from pics, but I think the 2 Michelin tyres are the front 2.

What do you think, are these red flags or am I overthinking it? Anything to look out for on the test drive which might give further clues? Would you buy?

In the 5 years I had it, the only issue I had was the glow plugs needing replacing and the fuel pump packing up.

I can honestly say it was probably the most dependable car I’ve ever had. I sold it at 130k miles (to my granddad, who still has it).

My point being is as long as you’ve got service history, the car drives okay then go with your gut. If you’re in doubt pay for an independent inspection. Does the car come with any form of warranty?

The garage you’re buying the car from may be responsible for the mismatched tyres. I bought a Kuga last year from a Ford main dealer which had 3 Michelin and one Rapid which they had put on as one of the tyres was damaged.

If it's for fuel cost reasons, the cheapest to insure car will be far more significant a saving.

The difference between 50mpg and 60mpg will simply not be that significant, even over 5000 miles. Online calculators reckon a difference of around £100 per 5000 miles. These are not important numbers relative to insurance and retail price of the car.

I'd say start building your priorities around size of car and how pleasant the experience of driving it is in terms of comforts. Then trade that off with sticker price, insurance and cost to repair.   
  
That's a far better priority list for a family car intended to do long euro trips while keeping it cost effective.

The 1.8 hybrid engine is superbly reliable and economical but it's still a tall car and if you press on speedwise you're just driving a big petrol engine down the motorway without much benefit from hybrid. It's lethargic, and if pushed hard, noisy. It'll never break though.

The newer 2.0 feels a lot quicker than the paper BHP suggests but is out of budget.

The RAV4 is a much bigger car and is powerful, but you won't see 50mpg on a run. Around town and on country roads, yes. It's a fantastic technical achievement, and won't break, and the PHEV gets useful savings from charging on night-rate power if you have it, but it's just not giving you 50mpg on the motorway - it's a great big garden shed of a thing.

The Niro is...OK. The PHEV has more power and again savings if you charge on night-rate power, but consumes boot space. The non-PHEV is slow. It's just a much less good hybrid setup, with a complex 6-speed gearbox that can be unresponsive. Think 45mpg. I think you will find the boot too small and need a roof box for trips with 2 kids.

I asked the dealer about it and they said they couldn't find anything regarding this during 135 point check that they do, for which they have sent me the document. You can see it passes checks for any fluid leaks/engine related leaks and also states that the rear shocks were replaced due to a leak. The car also comes with 3 months warranty.

I really like this specific car, the spec, it seems very well looked after, its just this one thing that's holding me back. Any advice?

1mqrwle,Fixed penalty for 'parking in a live lane' and 'within 10m of junction' - advice please,"Hi all,

I recently got a Conditional Offer of Fixed Penalty for £30 for an alleged offence of 'unnecessary obstruction' in Liverpool.

I’ve parked in this spot many times since moving to my flat last year because my apartment doesn’t come with a car space, and this area has been my only option. On the day in question, my car was parked where the red cross is on the satellite image (between the grey and red car). There are cars parked in the same area *all the time* and I've not seen any parking charge notice issued before or after the day my car and other cars there were given one.

I emailed the issuing authority asking for clarification, but they replied saying the issuing officer “wishes to proceed” and stated the reasons as: “parking in a live lane of a carriageway thus obstructing the traffic flow” and “within 10m of a junction”. They’ve given me two options: pay £30 now or take it to court.

Here’s why I’m confused:

* I measured the distance on Google Maps — both sides to the nearest junction are well over 20 metres, not within 10 metres they claimed.
* The spot is on the side of the road where cars regularly park. Traffic was still able to pass in both directions without obstruction. There's no single or double yellow line either.

I really don’t think I’m in the wrong, but I also don’t want the stress of court proceedings over £30. I’ve had my licence since 2012 and no previous driving offences.

**Questions:**

* Does paying this fixed penalty leave a record/points on my licence?
* Has anyone contested something like this and won?
* Is there any free legal advice service worth contacting?
* Would this be worth taking to court or is it too risky for the cost involved?

Any help and advice appreciated!

openroadsUK (Score: 18): It's possibly not been on the road since 1985 , it's probably laid up somewhere or has been disposed of and paperwork not done!

Just as an FYI for people commenting about the tax , even as a vehicle over 40 years old you still need to go through process of taxing a vehicle , it's just free once registered historic

It deserves to be in a showroom somewhere

1mqk1iv,Seeking Advice from Experienced Mechanics,"Hi everyone,

I’m about to start my Level 3 Vehicle Maintenance and Repair Principles and I’m curious about getting my first job once I’ve completed my last year any advice?

I’d love to hear from experienced mechanics about tips for someone starting out:
Any practical skills I should focus on early
Advice on getting work experience or placements in the UK
Common pitfalls to avoid when starting in the trade

I really want to make the most of this opportunity and build a solid foundation. Any guidance, stories, or advice would be hugely appreciated!

Thanks in advance!

Get to grips with electrical fundamentals and basic diagnosis steps. So many fully qualified techs don’t know shit about electrical fault finding. It’s pretty abstract but if you can get your head around it and put it to practical use and effectively solve problems you are instantly 10x more valuable than the other monkeys who can just about turn a spanner.

Learn how to safely shut down and work around high voltage systems, it’s super common now and the stuff in those orange cables will kill the fuck out of you.

Don’t spend all your money on snap on.

If you borrow a tool more than once; buy it.

Organise yourself. You can never be to organised, memory will fail you but if you’re hyper organised you don’t need to remember what every bolt is for because past-you labelled and bagged it all.

Your toolbox has wheels… never forget that. Don’t get stuck working somewhere that doesn’t value you."
