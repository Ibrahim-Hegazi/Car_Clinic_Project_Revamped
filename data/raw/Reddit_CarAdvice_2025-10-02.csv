1nvon0r,Front left wheel noise – should I get this checked?,"https://reddit.com/link/1nvon0r/video/aico2ip59lsf1/player

Hey everyone,

I’m noticing a repeating noise coming from my front left wheel. I recorded a short video while driving so you can hear it (attached). The noise seems to change with speed, but I can’t tell if it’s brakes, a bearing, or something with the wheel itself.

Does this sound like something I should take into a shop right away, or is it safe to monitor for a bit? Any input on whether this points to a wheel bearing, brakes, or suspension issue would be helpful.

Thanks in advance!",1,1759362944.0,2,MechanicAdvice,1759433558,2025-10-01 23:55:44,2025-10-02 19:32:38,"Jean_le_Jedi_Gris (Score: 1): Not easy to tell but sure sounds like a bearing to me.

The point is, it's installed now and staying ha. It is definitely slightly thicker. It seems to work flawlessly.

The leaking hose was likely from a defective hose, particularly since you said the hose failed...

1nvnf6g,EGR MONITOR NOT SETTING HELP PLS,"Hello everybody! Hope everybody’s doing well! Been having an issue with my 2004 Mitsubishi Montero Sport XLS. I was wondering if anybody else has had an issue with their EGR monitor not completing. I’m out here in California so I’ve been needing it to complete in order to pass my smog check. All my other monitors have no problem completing and I have no check engine light. The car is fitted with a new Wells Electronics EGR valve and Dorman EGR solenoid. I been dealing with this issue for some time now and put in those new parts with my father. Despite them being in, I still had rough idle, high idle and a jumping RPM. I just then drove the car with the EGR vacuum hose unplugged since it ran smoother like that. Then after finally taking it to a mechanic recently, I was informed that the vacuum hoses that lead to the EGR needed to rerouted and the throttle cable needed to be adjusted. After that the high idle was no more and the RPM ceased to jump up and down with the vacuum hose plugged into the valve. The rough idle calmed down quite a bit but days after while in the DRIVE gear and stopped, the car seems to idle rough again, though without the previous other issues. And of course my EGR monitor is still not completing after being driven for hundreds of miles at this point. With all that being said I was wondering if anybody else has had this issue and what yall did to solve it. If anybody just has any tips or recommendations, I would really appreciate it. I’m trying here because I’m a little strapped for cash honestly. There’s a lot of places where I’m located that for an amount will pass my car under the table but I would really like to find the issue or a solution to this without dropping 300+. I’ve gone to 3 mechanics where near where I live and they all told me just to keep driving it and since there’s no check engine light there’s nothing they can do. It’s been really frustrating to say the least. This being my only car, I need it to really last! I’m attaching some photos and some advice I was given as well some information I found on a forum.

 unplug sensor.. probe the first and third terminal with the key on.. you should see 5.0 volts..    

 from one end terminal to ground you should see exactly 5.0 volts. Brown/white wire to ground is 5.0 volts key on. 

 from the other end terminal to ground you should see 0.04 volts or less..  grey/red is ground for many of the sensors.. 0.04 volts.. you can test this on the diagnostic connector too.. grey/red strip.. should be no more than 0.04 volts 

 Check the voltage at terminal 47 with a voltmeter. Backprobed   this is the center wire on the throttle position sensor to ground ..  this is Grey White.  you should see from 0.50 volts closed throttle to 4.2 volts wide open throttle . if you are getting less than 0.40 you have an issue.. go back and check the other wires first. 

 Rotate the throttle linkage by hand and verify that the voltage is within specification.

 Crank/cam sensor wiring varies if you have an automatic or manual transmission..

 332 requires at least a vacuum gauge. you can get 15PSI /30"" of vacuum gauges for less than 20 bucks at most parts and tool stores.. 

 tee into the vacuum hose to the EGR valve..  put the gauge on the windshield under the wiper arm..  take a short test drive.. you should NOT see vacuum while stopped.. but as soon as you start to accelerate perhaps 3 MPH.. you should start to see progressive vacuum applied to the EGR valve.. maxing vacuum reading around 40 or 45MPH. what do you have..

1nvn8qr,How much should it cost to replace 2 calipers and brake pads? Did i get overcharged?,"I own a 2012 Hyundai Sonata GLS, 118k miles on it.  
To spare you the backstory, the total cost, parts and labor, was $880.  
 Context: Recently the rear calipers on my car seized up and stopped moving, especially on one side. This caused a lot of wear to the pads, unknown to me, until i heard grinding noise when braking for about a couple weeks ago. So i took it to a local shop and they replaced both (2) rear calipers, and the accompanying brake pads. They did say that they used higher quality parts (DFC ultra premium brake pads and that each caliper was $240 each), and also bled the brakes, filled the master cylinder, used new hardware kits, and lubricated all new slide pins). It only took about 1 hour to do, maybe 1.5hrs, estimating, and their labor cost is $105 per hour.  
 Also, one concern, on the receipt or printout it didn't show any itemized prices per part or service, not even section of labor cost vs part cost, only a list of what was done and the total. They also didn't give me an estimate or any prices before hand (maybe because they were rushed and i arrived 1 hour before they close. I told them i can come back tomorrow but they really didn't recommend driving in that condition, and were seemed totally fine, if not eager, with doing the job).  

At the end of all this, it cost me $880 in total. Is that a fair and reasonable price? 

Although i definitely needed this work done and they seemed like decent people, i cant help but worry that i might have gotten ripped off and they overcharged me somehow. Then again, I'm not a mechanic so what do i know. I did do a rough estimate adding everything up and they're within a reasonable margin, it seems.

We have a 2012 Chevy Cruze that's my wife's commuter. 16x,xxx miles. About a month ago it started dying on her way to work. The first time it happened she shut off the car and turned it back on in a minute and it was fine.

Since then it's died a four or five times, about every 8th or 9th time it's driven. It's been in and out of the shop and our local (reputable) place has finally said they can't figure it out. It's to the point that when it dies it takes a while to turn back on.

When it dies it just cuts off but will coast. Sometimes when it's turned back on it won't go forward unless you put it in reverse first. Letting the car sit for half an hour has a 100% chance of getting it to start again.

1nvj2ep,Need alternator advice...,"Hey guys. I have been having issues with my car for the last 3 weeks now and its been a real pain in tbe butt, for many reasons. Some of it i have already brought up here in previous posts you may have seen. But they were both way too long which i think limited the people that actually read it and offered help. So im gonna try to be brief even tho i never can. Lol.

So in a one line recap, i had what i thought was a alternator issue abd the car died. Towed it to a shop near my house who said alternator was fine, it was my fuel pump. Had that replaced and 3 days later i am having similar problems that i had before the fuel pump fix. That shop and autozone both ran a test on my battery which they said was good, and my alternator,  which was apparently failing. For many reasons(its a long story lol) i no longer will use the shop i had the pump done at. So thats where i am currently. 

In a previous post, i asked about whether you guys thought switching out an alternator on a 2020 nissan versa was doable for a handy but mechanically limited guy to which the consensus was i could. I havent yet for 2 reasons mainly. 1) is i was waiting for a direct deposit paycheck to hit my account cause the pump and not having a car for about a week wiped me out financially. And 2) i am starting to wonder if it is my alternator.  Or at least, if its only my alternator.  I say this cause i have had the car back now for 3 days and even tho im not driving it a lot, when i have drove it, i havent had any obvious issues that scream alternator. I have limited what i have on while driving, such as no radio and no AC, but other then that i havent seen any flickering of the dashlights or the headlights the one time i had to use them. Now, clearly SOMETHING is wrong with the car cause the main issue/symptom i have with it, is when i take it out onto a highway or just need performance to accelerate, it feels real sluggish and doesnt get up to the speeds it used to and needs to. Probably no more 60-65mph but i havent really pushed it. But other then that, i havent seen much else. Car starts up right away each time i started it but i have only started once each day and then i left it running the hour or 2 i was out with it, to potentially limit startup issues. So i guess my question to you guys is does that seem like an alternator thing? Losing power like that? Clearly it tested off so it is at least part of the problem if not the problem. But i am not sure if i am possibly having other issues along with it, which is why im hesitant to take a go at replacing the alternator myself.

Honestly it's hard to confirm without testing and understanding everything that is happening with the reduced power, but it sounds plausible. 

I know this isn't super helpful, but I have a 12 volt device that tells me the voltage the device is receiving while I am driving. It should fluctuate between 13.5 - 14 volts (modern alternators reduce output unless needed) when you're driving. Older cars it should stay around 14 volts.

(You DID ASK for it, right?)

While a lead-acid battery is getting charged (alternator charges, replacing draw used for starting the engine) Hydrogen is a small byproduct that can be created in the battery. 

*Hydrogen highly explosive, so no smoking near your batteries!

Check your charging system, too high voltage can make it more likely to happen, and more often. 13.6V-14.3V is a good range from the alternator. 

As it vents, the liquid acid is splashing around a bit, so some venting carries small amounts of the electrolyte along with it. 
Ideally it would stay dry, and you’d never be aware of any venting. 
Sometimes it is the plastic around the terminals that are the weak spots, and is more common. 
As suggested, inspect the areas near the battery, and look particularly at the tray that the bottom of the battery sits on. 
Disconnect the negative terminal first, then disconnect the positive terminal.
If it has accumulated in the tray, you should actually remove the battery to clean the entire area around the battery, as well as the battery itself. 
For the battery area and the battery, itself rinse off as much as possible with a hose, first to dilute any acid.

Grab a small cup of water, put some (teaspoon) baking soda in it, then using a plastic brush (old toothbrush) scrub all of that off the battery (special attention to the battery terminals, and even more so cleaning the wire terminals) and any other residue still around where the battery sits; this neutralizes any remaining acid. 
Rinse everything off again, then wait as long as possible for everything to dry before you place the battery back in its position.
Before you reconnect the wire terminals to their terminals do the following preventative steps.
The auto parts store will have a little kit of red & green felt washers, plus a special grease. (Last month I paid $1.99 for a packet that contained all 3.)
Follow the instructions on the packet.

Connect the battery’s positive terminal first, then the negative terminal last.

An average car battery contains approx 700Wh of charge. The amperage value dictates the charging speed. If you pick a 1A mode, it'd charge your battery 1A \* 14V = 14W per hour. If your battery is depleted by half, this mode would recharge your battery in 700Wh / 2 / 14W = 25 hours. 10A mode should charge 10 times faster."

I have a 2018 Hyundai Tucson that recently needed to be towed due to the vehicle not being able to accelerate past 20mph. At the mechanic shop, they let me know that my catalytic converter was ""clogged"" and needed to be cleaned out (photo attached of the debris). The vehicle now accelerates, but I need a new catalytic converter installed and my personal extended warranty won't cover it. However, I was notified of something called the Clean Air Act emissions warranty where the manufacturer covers faulty catalytic converters for 8 years or up to $80,000 miles (my vehicle has 63,000 miles). Has anyone ever had this issue before and was able to have this emissions act cover the cost of the catalytic converter completely? 

I called Hyundai to make an appointment, but they told me there would need to be an assessment and that the fee is $199. It would NOT be refundable if the catalytic converter is not covered by the warranty.

The hub that fit the Skyhawk rim is triangular shaped in the rear and is not like this one. So, it's possible that the hub fits another vehicle but has the same pattern as the Buick Skyhawk.

 So many years ago, I made a lot of utility trailers in my shop in my spare time. I used drop Nick Axel that were on front-wheel-drive vehicles I had at the time, a friend who owned a auto wrecking yard would let me have the Axel and tires for $100 each. I used many different vehicles

Pontiac Sunbird-Cavalier-etc. anything that had a drop Neck rear axle that I could turn into a trailer axle. I used the same hydraulics with the brakes I cut off drop neck part and extended it to what I needed and welded it to another piece of pipe. I use the hydraulics brakes with an actuator hitch which were well.

 The problem I have is a trailer I have now that I kept needs replacement hub and I cannot for my life figure out what vehicle it came off of some hoping

some of you out there might be able to identify it. It does fit the OEM Buick Skyhawk rim but apparently, it's not a Buick Skyhawk hub.

Check the flex disc at the driveshaft connection for cracks or looseness. Check the rear driveshaft CV joint (at the differential input). Inspect rear axles for play at the joints.

HashtagJohnWayne (Score: 2): I spent a year working at a shop that specialized in electrical issues, and battery/starter/cable/alternator issues were our bread and butter.  
  
From what I can see in the video, this is not a battery issue or you wouldn't be able to start the car in the first place (cranking the starter is the battery's primary function).   
Also not likely an alternator issue as the battery wouldn't be able to keep cranking the engine if getting no charge. Testing for 14ish volts while running to see if the alternator is in fact charging is a good idea, but note that many alternators don't really charge at idle but only at higher engine speeds, so have a buddy rev the engine while you watch the meter to see if it goes up. (FYI, a healthy battery that's fully charged should read about 12.7v on a multi-meter).

This looks like some sort of sensor/control issue to me. From the behavior I'm seeing it looks like the fuel pump doesn't stay running. Most modern fuel systems use one signal from the key/starter switch to engage the pump to get the car started, then get a different signal from the engine to keep it on. It's been too long for me to say exactly where that signal comes from, but code scanning is your likely next step."

1nv6boc,Alternator Myasthenia Gravis,"Excuse the title but have been having an issue with my alternator which is a bit of a head scratcher (2006 Kia Cerato).

  
Effectively the alternator will work completely fine for the first 2-3 times I run my car any given day. The battery light has been a reliable indicator of this which I have confirmed using a multimeter and had some close calls with the battery nearly running out. 

When the car turns on and the alternator is working (or at least that it is delivering charge to the battery), it will work for the duration of that drive, regardless of how long the engine is running. This is the case any time I turn the car on for the first time any given day.

However when turning on the car for subsequent trips during the day it becomes an increasingly unfavourable flip of the coin as to whether the alternator will decide to charge the battery. When the alternator decides not to work upon turning on the engine, it will not come on during that drive (mostly). 

I have noted that if I park my car somewhere cool under shade during the day as opposed to out in the sun (I live in a very hot place) and it is left for a long period of time, the alternator is more likely to work. Alternatively, turning the car back on shortly after a taking it on a long drive appears to give the highest probability of the alternator not wanting to work. This indicates to me the issue is likely temperature related...

So far have:

\- ruled out belt tension

\- Checked relevant fuses/relays

\- Checked most connections (could review this more thoroughly admittedly) 



Effectively, given the overall picture and that when its working the alternator has no issue, I don't believe the issue to be the alternators ability to generate power, rather for the car is deciding not to direct this to charging the battery for some inexplicable reason that appears related to repeated use throughout the day.

  
The most likely culprit I can think of is maybe the battery temp sensor, however I would think that were this the case the alternator would cut out mid long drive. I am also unsure how to check this or if theres any easy corrections. Any thoughts or ideas from people who have encountered a similar problem?

1nvocow,Installing M14x1.5 Tesla Model 3 wheels on my M12x1.5 2020 Lexus ES350.,"Hey!

I recently purchased a set of Model 3 18"" Aero wheels that I plan to install on my 2020 Lexus ES350.

Factory: 18x8 +45 60.1 235/45/R18 M12x1.5 (Mag)
Tesla: 18x8.5 +40 64.1 235/45/R18 M14x1.5 (Conical)

My issue is the factory wheels run M12x1.5 studs/lugnuts, whereas my factory setup utilizes M12x1.5.

I know I'll need hubcentric rings, 60.1 to 64.1, though I'm still undecided on material since this is my daily and I drive often. I would appreciate some input on that, but mainly...

Whether I can run them safely. After tons of research, I have settled on two reasonable options. The first one seems to be the better choice because they have a 24mm base, yet retain my factory socket size. The second one is what people tend to run as Ford is close enough, but I see that the lip is likely what makes the overall diameter 27, so the seat would likely be closer to the first option anyway.

But at idle/low engine speed, the turbo isn't spinning fast enough to pull any meaningful amount of air into the engine. If anything it's probably more of an obstruction to airflow. Less air means less fuel needed, but will probably bring the idle up, or change camshaft profiles to allow the engine to idle properly compared to NA. (Changing idle speed and cam profile could require more fuel, neutralized through other small changes. Might be a slight negative, too many variables to guess off the hip). 

Typically turbo variants of an NA engine also have a lower compression ratio which to accommodate the higher cylinder pressure under load. This typically requires more fuel to produce the same amount of power as an NA engine. (Less useful work extracted per stroke of the engine not under boost.)

With just these two things in mind, it's probably a slight negative at idle specifically.

The car here is 2001 Mitsubishi galant (8th gen), sorry if the video doesn't really give some points of view but it's definitely not a turbocharged one that I got lol, it's still naturally aspired, and the point of the video is more to show the noise that I meant.

So the engine here sounds to be whistling but I can't really seem to diagnose the real problem, the whistle has gone for quite sometimes, at first, it wasn't that loud and the whistling sound would only come after the engine temperature is hot enough to somehow whistle, but now it whistles even when I just started it, and also, when I turn it off, it sounds like something is closing from the whistling noise itself.

Please help, any suggestion would be great now as I got more worried 😥

Hi,

It looks like that switch does all the directional control, as well as folding them in and out. This is a picture of what that switch should look like. It should be available at most local auto parts stores. It looks like there is a metal clip at the 3 o'clock position to hold it in. There may be another clip at the 9 o'clock position as well. 

You can remove your old one by inserting something flat and thin under the lip and pressing these clips in and then pry upwards. There should be just an electrical plug on the back to undo. You can even remove your old one and take it with you just to make sure the electrical connection on the back of the switch is the same as the new one before buying. Hope this helps!"

First week and a half I had no problems. Then I filled up with fuel (not sure if this has anything to do with it?). Also temps have dropped little over the last few weeks too. 

I have also only used the car for work. I drive to work. Takes roughly 20 minutes on dual carriageways/roundabouts and then obviously 20 minutes home at night. 

I have no warning lights or noises or anything that’s making me think OMG I need to get this sorted. 

Basically what is happening is when I drive the car it’s fine. But once the car gets up to temperature it will let out white smoke from the exhaust. But it’s not all the time. 

It only happens once the car is up to temperature and Then only if I fully stop the car for example at roundabouts. If I go in to a roundabout and slowdown but not stop and then press the accelerator there is no smoke. 

But if I come to a complete stop. Then press the accelerator it will let out a puff of white smoke. 

It does this for around 3-4 roundabouts (if I stop) and then after that it doesn’t do it anymore. Even if I come to a complete stop. There is no smoke. 

I’ve also noticed on the drive home it seems to do it less often. So going to work it’s roughly around 3-4 times but coming home it’s more like once or twice. 

So it’s really confusing. I’ve googled it and saw certain things mentioned like turbo issues, coolant leaks and head gaskets but I have none of those symptoms. 

The car is fine with acceleration and top speed. There are no leaks or warning lights. My coolant is fine and no smoke from the front. 

It just lets out smoke a few times when I stop and then nothing. It stops. So I’m kinda confused why it does it.

I ran into a weird issue with my 2017 Subaru Impreza Sport 1.6l FWD and I’m trying to figure out what’s going on. I was driving down a small driveway when the car suddenly stalled as I hit the base of the hill. After a few attempts, it finally started again.

A few notes:

Fuel was around half a tank.

Battery connections are solid.

After restarting and driving off, I heard a brief grinding noise from the left front wheel, but it turned out to be brake debris, so that’s likely not related.

Wheels have no play; suspension and bearings seem fine.

The car is front-wheel drive.

No dashboard warning lights stayed on.


I’ve been sticking to one fuel brand (though from different pumps), and I’m wondering if fuel quality could play a role.

What I’m considering:

1. Fuel issue — weak pump, relay, or fuel quality?


2. Electrical/sensor issue — crankshaft/camshaft sensor, starter, ignition.


3. Something else mechanical, though nothing is obviously loose.



Has anyone experienced a similar intermittent stall like this in a Subaru Impreza? How would you approach diagnosing it, especially if it hasn’t repeated yet? Would an OBD2 scan catch something like this, or do I need a dealer-level diagnostic?

(Pictures of Fuel Pump and Fuel Pump Wire (includes wire colors and connection points for colored wires))

# Issue Description

* Car started idling roughly.
* After running for a bit, I noticed a burning smell (similar to burning rubber, but not quite).
* I did not attempt to drive the vehicle, but I did rev it to see if the issue would resolve itself.
* Vehicle is not driven often (about once every two weeks, short runs just to keep it going).
* Location: Florida (not necessarily coastal, but hot climate, \~7 miles from ocean).
* Check engine light behavior:
   * Sometimes **steady**
   * Sometimes **blinking**

# OBD-II Codes Pulled

* **P0300**: Random/multiple cylinder misfire
* **P0181**: Fuel temperature sensor circuit range/performance

# Testing Performed at ~80°F outside with car in driveway

1. **Multimeter readings at the fuel pump hat connector:**
   * Pink & Black wires: **0.7 ohms** (auto ohm/continuity mode)
   * White & Yellow wires: **20.9 ohms** (auto ohm/continuity mode)
   * Switched to **KΩ setting**:
      * Pink & Black: **0.001 KΩ**
      * White & Yellow: **0.02 KΩ**
   * All other probe points showed **OL (open line)**
2. **Continuity testing toward ECM wiring:**
   * Began probing wires going toward ECM (assuming for continuity-to-ground test).
   * Did not complete full testing; unsure if battery needs to be connected during this test.
   * Noted that at least 2 wires did show continuity to ground, but I did not write down values.

# Notes

* Purchased spark plugs before pulling codes (was initially going to replace them assuming a bad plug).
* Considering replacing the entire **fuel pump assembly** (assuming it includes the temp sensor?).
* RockAuto shows a replacement assembly around **$150**—leaning toward this due to limited use of vehicle.
* Car sits for long periods; wondering if **corrosion or stale fuel** may be contributing to the problem.

# Questions for Mechanics

1. Based on symptoms + codes + testing, does it sound like the **fuel pump assembly** needs to be replaced?
2. Could the **misfire (P0300)** be caused by a weak/failed fuel pump, or should I still replace the spark plugs also?
3. Is the **fuel temperature sensor** part of the pump assembly on this car (looking at AUTOTECNICA NI0517499 as possible replacement fuel pump)?
4. Any brand recommendations for replacement fuel pump (considering vehicle is not daily driven, but should still be reliable for occasional long trips \~200 miles)?
5. For a car that sits for long periods in a hot climate:
   * Should I be adding **fuel stabilizer**?
   * Any other maintenance recommendations?

About two months ago I took it to some other place my cousin goes to for yearly inspection and some maintenance (some arm bar like replaced it attached to the front wheels). 
Then occasionally I’d smell gas. So I had it checked out. They replaced a fuel pump and some other parts for it.

That following week it started making a light sound (can’t explain) that not everyone could hear and it wasn’t all the time. 

I took it back to that garage and they couldn’t find anything. So I drove with the one guy and showed him. They replaced two parts but a few hours later they said it was some other part again so after replacing that 3rd part the car was fine. 

Two weeks or less goes by and the car is making that noise again and that week it was about to break down all craziness went on that I never seen before. Engine light went on, then it wouldn’t go faster then 18mph the pedal was all the way down and the engine was racing up louder, as I went to pull over near a pavement the car started to shake wildly and the engine light was flashing. The notification screen showed Stark something and showed tools. I shut the car off for a few minutes. When I turned it back on I slowly drove back to that garage because it was closer (and I had people in the car) then the traction control light went on a few times and maybe brake light. When we got to the garage and I think I shut the car off. 

The mechanics went to test drive it, twice once with me because it was almost completely fine and they mechanic thought it was completely fine until I told him that noise when the tachometer is at 1 and 2-1/2 it makes a sound but not at 1-1/2 and I think after every stoplight and stop sign and sometimes when you start it. But under the hood looked fine and sounds fine. 
So the place looked at it for a few days. He said strangely one catalytic converter is rusted and hardly working and it’s hallowed out.

. I had absolutely no idea and didn’t know if it’s normal. The computer code reader showed lots of codes and some other stuff. So the mechanics refused to work on it and changed me $50 and suggested I sell it or take it to the dealership because it’s going to be a lot of work and complicated and expensive. 

I ended up taking it to two other places. One place who I know and he’s worked on my cars before. I don’t remember much at that point, he replaced a part and cleaned out the catalytic systems with something and the engine light off and suggested I take it to some place down the street because they do catalytics. 

At that place few miles down the street, had 4 guys playing around extensive search for almost two hours. He says it needs a motor mount $700 with labor and it could drive across the USA and it’s a great car it be a shame to get rid of it and I should keep it. 

So, I couldn’t decide on fixing it and were they lying or no (I recently heard they did something to someone catalyst converter) or selling it. 

I drove it again for 10 miles or less one day and it was good except that light sound (I have video of it) on the way home, the engine did that racing up and seemed like I couldn’t go faster for a second. But that was it. 

Then it sat at home again for a few days. I took it to that 2nd guy who I know and who did get that engine light off. Just for opinions and look at it. As soon as I started the car, I heard that sound and it felt like something from the back of the car. Then car drove past a few houses, the engine light went on and started blinking. I shut the car off and restarted it. Halfway to the garage it seemed like it was hard to get it to move faster and sometimes that sound got slightly louder. Eventually I didn’t have to really press in the gas because it was going 28mph fine. 
When I got to the place, I told the mechanics and they both said its misfiring and it’s probably not the motor mount and I should sell it but it’s a shame to. Because I could fix it but something is going to go wrong again. He was going to look at it anyway and cI said no it’s ok Thank you anyway. I wonder if that yearly inspection did something. Upset. Sad. Mad. Aggravate. Worried. What car can I afford now! I don’t want an old junky car. I don’t want to buy a car with unknown history and maybe someone else’s problems. I don’t want to buy another salvage car and rebuild it. I don’t want to buy another rebuild title car. I liked my car. But yes I like a lot of cars.

1nuyyoa,Got a better job offer from competing shops and dealers and my boss is guilting me to stay.,"So I guess I'll start the story last week, we had a mass exodus of technicians due to one of the service advisors abusing and cursing out techs. My manager is old and doesn't care anymore and when he's in pain he tends to curse people out too, I've been on the receiving end of this a handful of times.

Around this time I started getting offers over the phone and through email and on a certain job site. I agreed to 5 interviews so far for jobs that pay 40% more with better benefits and less hours.

I'm not sure how but today my boss called me into his office and asked me if I was planning on leaving, he said through the grapevine he saw that I was taking interviews through a certain job site. I said nothing is confirmed but I have gotten offers.

The service advisor walked in and demanded to know what the names of these shops and dealers were. I didn't tell him any real names, I gave him names of the dealers I didn't get offers from to throw him off.

Now my manager said since we've lost 6 techs over the last 4 weeks if I leave quote ""your fucking us"" and ""it feels like a slap in the face after everything we've done for you.""

I do feel bad because I learned a lot here, I made my fair share of mistakes and he did defend me from the owner when I made a costly mistake.

He offered me a better position in February of next year if I stay but to be honest I'm sick and tired of being the ""go to guy"" when they hire a bunch of people off the street with no experience and no tools for me to train.

I'm not sure what to do here. Also the other shop said if I get the job I'll start right away on Monday next week which doesn't give me enough time to give my 2 weeks notice. What the hell do I do?",22,1759293331.0,96,mechanic,1759433558,2025-10-01 04:35:31,2025-10-02 19:32:38,"lucaslizard (Score: 48): Jump ship. Work to make money not friends

Behind the dash, in your AC plenums, are little motors that adjust baffles to direct the airflow out the selected vents. Floor, upper, split, defrost, etc. 

Failure mode is these baffles get jammed or the teeth on the actuator motors get worn out and begin to slip, leading to this sound. Usually it's a bit of a combination of both, the baffles jam or get stiff which cause the actuator gears to begin to wear out. What you are hearing is actuator motor gear popping as it continues to rotate but the baffle doesn't move and the teeth on either/or pop.

Unfortunately it's almost always that a substantial amount of disassembly is required which leads to fairly significant repair costs. Sometimes they can be replaced without pulling the whole dash however. 

What work did the mechanics do to address your freon leak? If they pulled the dash to replace something like your evaporator core then you may have some leverage, but it may also be a completely random but ill timed failure.

Best bet is to source an engine yourself via Breakers yard or similar, some have videos running prior to removal etc.

Then it's just a case of phoning round a few decent garages for quotes. Remember they'll need to change the oil, oil filter, timing belt (if it needs it) aux belt etc. once the old engine is removed, time will need to be spent removing and stripping your old engine of its ancillaries and fitting them to the new engine. Then its a case of bolting it in, plumbing and wiring. 

Looking at 3-5 days roughly for a competent garage (or a weekend with late nights with your mates and beers). 

However, if the car was running, it's not the timing belt. Timing belt snaps, engine doesn't run, doesn't even turn over properly. Did he maybe suggest it's skipped a tooth and the timings off ? If so may be an easy fix.

I tried all of these, and there was no noticeable difference in the noise:
-topping off oil
-refilling with Super 93 Octane
-driving in lower gear

If there's any other info that would be helpful to provide, please let me know.

Many thanks in advance!

i just bought a 2003 Echo for 1200 bucks. It currently has 254,000 kms. I was aware that i had to fix the exhaust because it was quite loud. I went to a shop near me (kinda sketchy shop) for a safety inspection.

they stated that the rust on the underbody was really bad and the car would require about 3 - 4k worth of repairs. Im not an expert on cars at all so I took 2 photos when it was on the tow truck and wanted to share them with you. What do you guys think?

i can see that a part of the crossmember is definitely rusted out. Theres a straight hole through it. Do you guys see anything else that should concern me? Should i just get rid of the car.

1nvn3ue,Why would this happen at around 50mph?,"2004 Silverado z71 204k miles. Was nearly home from a 4 hour drive the other day when the ABS and parking break light came on the day, simultaneously the speedometer needle started erratically moving. The truck drove fine, stopped fine, and otherwise presented no concern. A while down the road some noise began to occur in the front left— best described as a loud rumble or vibration. But again, the truck drove and stopped fine and the lights/sounds/speedo action only occur at about 50mph+. 

Obviously there is an issue in the braking system somewhere. I’ve crawled all around and under everything and can’t seem to locate anything out of sorts. If I drove it just around town I’d never know this issue existed. Occasionally when driving and stopped at a light it’ll squeak or sound like it’s taking effort to let off the brakes. 

Any ideas what this could be?

1nviasm,What decides that an engine revs slow or fast?,"(Photo for engagement)

I recently bought this 2018 civic hatch lx with the 1.5t and the more I’ve been driving it, the more I realize that the rpm’s take forever to drop back down to idle with the clutch in if I’m coming to a stop or that if I rev it with the clutch in or in neutral, it just takes forever to reach redline. 

In comparison, my vehicle before this was a 2015 mazda 3 with the 2.0, also manual. I could be at 4k rpm, neutralize the engine, and it would hang for half a second, then instantly drop super quick. Same for revving up, throw it in neutral or push the clutch, give it gas, and it shot right up to redline. 

I ask the question stated in the title because I’ve been driving the civic since april 2025 and I still can’t get used to the slow rpm movement and it really effects the smoothness on shifts and rev matching unlike in the mazda where it was so quick that shifting to any gear, up or down, could be done so quickly and made the driving experience better. 

So what directly causes this? If I want to make my civic feel as quick with the rpm’s as the mazda did, is it as simple as getting a tune? Will I need to throw money into the engine and build it a certain way? Or am i just SOL and I’m gunna have to unlearn the mazda and relearn how to drive a car a whole different way? 

TL/DR: I’m not trying to raise the redline. The 6.5k is where it’ll stay cuz I’m not trying to send a rod through the block. I’m just trying to cut down the time it takes to go from idle rpms to redline free revving.

Sorry for the long post, and thank you to whoever reads all that and answers :)

If the revs get too low you gotta put a lot of throttle into the engine to get them back up, after all. It can be removed with a tune. But I'd just focus on my technique. You can drive and shift these things smoothly, just use a bit more clutch.

darklogic85 (Score: 3): It's likely just a tuning decision with your car from the manufacturer. Since it's a manual, having that RPM hang allows the driver more time to shift between gears without slipping the clutch much to the next gear when you're shifting up. It allows for smoother shifts for normal driving situations. Your car isn't a performance car or engine, so it isn't tuned for performance/race situations, so fast downshifts and quick revs aren't the focus with the factory tune.

If you're talking about how it could be done with modified performance cars, there are a number of factors that come into play with how quickly it revs. Also, A professional tune with that focus in mind, and lightweight flywheel can make a big difference, but I wouldn't recommend doing that for a car you drive daily because it'll be frustrating to deal with in normal driving situations. Also, when revving up, non-turbo engines tend to rev faster since there's exhaust back pressure initially when revving up from an idle in a turbocharged engine. So if your Mazda was non-turbo, that could be another factor that gives it a different feel."

Various online quotes to sell the car have been between $1,500-$3,000.

I don’t desire to get a new car right now and would like to keep mine if it is safe to do so with smaller repairs/maintenance and if it makes sense financially. Given how much my monthly costs would rise with a new/used car and the cost of taxes and registering it in a new state I’d like to avoid it for at least a year, but I also don’t want to be a dummy about it and waste money that could be invested better. 

The car is paid off in full, my insurance is super cheap, it gets good MPG and I had 4 new tires put on at the start of this year.

* Drive belt & belt tensioner leaking
* Spark plugs → replace (never done at mileage interval)
* Multiple fluid flushes suggested (transmission, coolant, brake, power steering) and fuel induction service recommended  (never done at mileage interval)
* Struts/shocks original & worn
* 4 wheel alignment recommended
* Leaking left front strut
* Cracked/tearing front exhaust flex pipe
* Excessive sway in left rear sway bar link
* Tearing front lower control arm bushings
* Tearing rear trailing arm bushings
* Bad rust on front subframe
* Broken muffler hanger + shield 
   * Part of it was falling off so the mechanic removed some of it and now it seems like the other pieces have become loose because I hear the rattling noise when I drive at low speeds that I didn’t hear for a about a week after they removed the broken pieces

**My questions:**

* What’s the bare minimum I should do to make the drive safely?
* Is it worth putting some money into this to try to keep it going for another year or two, or should I cut my losses and buy something new soon?

Definitely not.

No, not unless your car bounces like a jack-in-the-box or you have play in the wheels.

* Excessive sway in left rear sway bar link

Ignore.

* Tearing front lower control arm bushings

My coolant reservoir is like a millimeter or so below the ""low"" marker. I've seen conflicting things about what to do. Manual and some say top it up with distilled water. Mechanic in the family says don't do that, just get a pre-mix and add. Online I see recommendations to use pre-mix, but make sure it's the right chemical cocktail because Korean engines use certain metals that don't work well with certain coolants. I've seen some say the colors have to match, some say it doesn't matter (mine is a green/blue).

Basically, what kind of coolant should I buy for this car to tide me over a few weeks before I get it serviced properly?

Also coolant, maintenance is way more important.

The turbocharger is lubricated with engine oil and cooled with engine coolant, and are very sensitive pieces of machinery. Neglect will kill them fast.

Temperatures can also get more extreme, which means it’ll be harder on oil and coolant to begin with.

Definitely use 90+ octane. Octane is, simplified, a measure of how difficult the gasoline is to set off. Things like high compression and boost make the gasoline tend to want to self-ignite before the spark plug fires, which can lead to engine damage. 

The higher octane fuel, by being less easy to set off, helps prevent that."

I do think there might be slight warpage on the block/head so what I can do is to get it skimmed and slap on a new gasket and some other stuff and just go with it. But I am worried if other stuff will cause issues in the future since they overheated as well (valves, springs, water pump thermostat etc.). And would it be worth it to get a complete overhaul in this case?

I am not sure even if the block/head gets skimmed and a new gasket is placed, would everything work as they are supposed to? I heard that trying to fix an overheated diesel is not as straightforward as a gas one, diesels might still end up in bad condition even after they are fixed properly (don't know if this is a myth or no, would appreciate if anyone could confirm this).

Last year I had a 2020 as a rental and I loved it. It drove super smooth, had amazing gas mileage, and was nice looking. So that’s pretty much what I’m looking for.

1nuzwg0,Are older vehicles really easier to work on in the grand scheme of things?,"Question for you guys, I've currently got a 2019 ranger that I'm about to swap the transmission on(aside from the FDRS system it actually seems simple enough), but definitely miss my older trucks, not so much because I think they were easier to work on per say but rather that they were less intimidating to work on. 


Reason I say this is things like rusted/seized bolts,  old wiring and shitty connector plug designs, and lack of new OEM parts always seemed to be an issue. My ranger is the FX4 so it's got a big ol skid plate which can be in the way, and the 2.3l Ecoboost motor still makes me nervous despite it honestly not seeming to have real bad longevity issues compared to other modern engines(first truck was an 82 Toyota mini truck with the 22R, and the second was a Cherokee with the 4.0 I6 to give an example of what I grew up on engine wise), plus I'm obviously less than impressed with the 10r80 rn, at least the ones without the updated components. But other than that and the tech/software, my ranger doesn't exactly seem all that difficult labor wise comparatively to my older vehicles.


Am I crazy for wanting to trade this thing in for a 1st Gen Tacoma or something similar? My main deal is I want a simple, durable motor(not to say one that doesn't need maintenance, I'm diligent with that), a manual transmission, simple radio, and honestly I don't even care if it's got power windows. I'm just remembering accidentally breaking electrical plugs, struggling with old stripped/rusted hardware, and shit like that and am left torn on whether or not I would actually end up with a truck that's easier to work on. 


Its starting to seem like the trade off of just having a shop do the programming work isn't that big of a deal compared to ""goddammit I sheered the fucking bolt"".

But he never tells me to do anything anytime a car comes in he gets some else to do it and there’s only 3 bays and each one is taken and then when I go to try to help someone they are alr half way through or I do something and then I’m stuck there with nothing to do because the owner never gave me anything, idk where half the tools are, idk what my role is because first day he opened the garage and cars started coming in and everyone is alr in motion and he’s telling people okay this car needs this and that and then moves on while I’m just standing there doing nothing so I have to go up to the workers and watch what they are doing and most of the time it’s a one person job so I’m just getting into peoples ways which I don’t wanna do. The only time I feel like im helping is when I’m jacking a car up or setting it up on the hoist or I’m balancing a tire or taking a tire off a rim. And I can’t go and help the workers with like jacking the car or taking tires off because idk what the job is because I don’t know what it’s in for, So what can I do and am I in the wrong 

I just wanted to added it’s not like I’m trying to look for work I go to each bay several times and try to hold lights try to get tools for them and stuff like that but they literally go and say um go help that guy or they just ignore me like I’m not standing there trying to get involved. And once the car comes in for something he genuinely goes to someone else and tells them to do it and skips over me. I understand he trust those guys more they have more experience but why not set me up with someone so I can learn. And today one thing he told me to do was remove a nail from the tire and patch it, I found where it was leaking air and I didn’t know where anything was because it was just a mess everywhere in the shop and after I didn’t know how to patch it properly he told it’s okay I’ll show you how to and ended up never showing me how to, and Ik it’s just a tire patch but it’s my second day like idk how to do it.

I'm not sure how but today my boss called me into his office and asked me if I was planning on leaving, he said through the grapevine he saw that I was taking interviews through a certain job site. I said nothing is confirmed but I have gotten offers.

Found a lower intake manifold gasket failure causing an oil leak on one of the ends of the valleys. I've gone through 2 gaskets, the second using some high torque rtv. Both times there was a coolant leak in the back in one of the water blockages. 

Both the rear head water passages seal off with the lower manifold, but the gaskets still have a hole there. The second time I tried using rtv on both sides of the gasket in hopes it would seal properly, but no dice. Though the second time it was much slower of a coolant leak, meaning the rtv material was almost a success. 

Theres a small but noticeable amount of pitting in the heads and manifold at the coolant passages, which is why I suspect the leak is persisting. That and I dont think I added enough rtv the second time. I also followed all the torque specs and torque order, and cleaned things off with a brass brush at a very slow speed on a drill. 

I'm going to give it another shot in hopes of getting the rtv to correctly seal, but are there any tips y'all can suggest?

1nutn0j,"2017 Toyota 4Runner Limited 4.0L V6 - P0014 error code, need help from experts","Hello,

I had an oil leak due to the cage that holds the oil filter getting a crack in it.  The mechanic told me I got very lucky getting the car there when I did because it was very low on oil.  They did not notice any damage or anything.  I got that fixed but the check engine light continues to come on after driving 30-40 miles.  

I take it to the dealership.  They say it doesn’t skip timing at all, they swapped around cam shaft sensors and still got the error.  I replaced the oil control valve, the check engine light still comes on after 30-40 miles.  

They said the next step is to change out the cam shaft exhaust gear for bank 1 and quoted me almost $5000.

I found a video earlier talking about that error code and it doesn’t even mention the oil control valve or the cam shaft exhaust gear.  Is it really possible that I damaged the exhaust gear like that?  The car is still running perfectly fine.  I feel like I’d notice if something like that was malfunctioning, but I am not the expert.

I have more documentation of everything if needed.

1nuwtcl,Could a maintenance subscription work?,"TLDR: High school friend wants to open an auto shop. He asked me if a subscription model for routine maintenance (oil changes, filters, tire rotations, etc.) would make sense financially. Curious what you all think… is this a viable business model, and what would the numbers look like?

⸻

A buddy of mine from high school is trying to make the jump into running an automotive shop full-time. He’s done well in tech but is totally burnt out, and cars have always been his real passion.

For context: he and his dad already run a small non-profit shop ministry connected to their local church. They maintain vehicles for church staff and provide services (referral-based) for low-income families and single parents. Many people volunteer throughout the week/weekend to help fix cars.

He recently asked me if I could help him think through a subscription model for auto maintenance. The idea would be something like:

> Customers pay a set monthly/annual fee

> Covered services: oil changes, filters, liquid top-offs, tire rotations, general maintenance

> Anything above and beyond that (brakes, belts, etc.) would still be charged, but at a discounted rate since you’re already subscribed

So my questions for you all:

1. Is this actually a viable business model?

2. How would you structure the numbers? (e.g., monthly fee ranges, limits on services, what’s realistic for both customer and shop)

3. Have you seen examples of this working (or failing) in other industries besides car washes/gyms)

Thanks in advance, y’all! ",2,1759286651.0,2,AutoMechanics,1759433558,2025-10-01 02:44:11,2025-10-02 19:32:38,"Ok_Initiative2666 (Score: 1): Its already being done… and you do not need subscriptions… it is called “specials”( oil change specials, free 75 pt inspection, etc…) and you cannot have a single standard prices for all makes and models. 1 carvtakes 4 qts oil, another will take 6, and yet another needs 8quarts. Same for brake service, etc…

Then there is Groupons - research on that

Basically, you need a parts supplier that gives you low prices on parts and oils because while you can cut costs, its foolish to cut your own nose by lowering labor just because its volunteer work? Your volunteers need to eat to and have families to feed. Shortchanging them for the sake of offering low price is same as snipping your nose

Freekmagnet (Score: 1): I do not see this as a viable business model in actual practice.     To provide these services to the general public you will have the same overhead and fixed costs (insurance, taxes, licenses and inspections, legal costs, shop space, service information, tools and equipment, labor costs, utilities, waste disposal, advertising, etc) as any other repair business.   The costs of these services vary widely by vehicle so flat pricing is not realistic- many cars require special fluids and oils now, for example some of the transmission and differential lubricants used in Ram pickups are $35-60 per quart. You absolutely need some kind of service information subscription to be able to know what to use and sometimes the special procedures involved so as to not damage vehicles or void warranties.    You will need a scan tool to change rear brakes on many vehicles now.  On Hyundai/ Kia vehicles if you use anything other than a genuine OE oil filter you risk voiding their 10 year/ 100k engine warranties.   Accidentally put the wrong transmission fluid in some cars and you now are on the hook for a $7k transmission replacement.

And then on top of that you will be expected to guarantee your work- if you do a half assed brake service using cheap discount quality parts and it increases stopping distance or makes noise they will expect you to do it again (and again) for free to restore the car to how it operated when they first got it- that wipes out a lot of shop profit very quickly and will rapidly convince you not to be using the cheapest parts you can find for your services.

Just for the icing on the cake, you will be competing with other shops, dealers, and Wal-mart that can easily undercut you on price for the same easy work.   Take all the (realistic, not wishful) fixed operating costs and divide by the expected profit to be made per vehicle per day, and you can easily see that the revenue generated will not begin to cover what you will need to invest and pay monthly to provide these services.     That is why other repair business sell other things like general repairs, tires, electrical repairs, diagnostic services, etc at high prices- not just cheap fluid services at discounted prices- they have to in order to stay in business.     

Doing free simple repairs for a church is a way different ball game than providing paid repair and maintenance services to the general public.    I would suggest you not get involved in this, especially if you have no industry experience- it is not likely to end well."

IE it's far from a performance edition/has rare parts. I may be wrong but doesn't really matter.

What most people don't realise is that every Audi comes with springs that are specific to that trim/option. It doesn't mean every car has unique springs, just that you may very well not have the same springs as your mate who also has a 2007 A3 1.6 SE.

Have yourself a google of Audi (or VW) spring colour codes. It explains it (a bit). But basically there will be three spots of paint on original springs that denote the specific characteristics. I think for mine (2009 A4) there's about 80 spring options lol.

So I would guess they are getting springs ""by the book"" - ie buying the specific springs your car should have from the factory. And they can only get these from Audi. Not really a bad thing in itself, but in reality you're probably not going to notice getting any set that fits your approximate trim/options (like, as you posted, a sportback spring is likely going to raise it far too much and be bouncier)"

They’re bloody hideous. 

I’m not a Mercedes guy so forgive my ignorance.

afgan1984 (Score: 9): ""Cool tuned""... seriously?

This is a bone-stock car on hideous aftermarket wheels with flat tyres. It sits low because the adaptive air suspension has faile - they sag when parked if there's a leak.

So basically, it's a bog-standard R230 SL that's broken (which, sadly, is quite a common state for these - they're not worth much and rarely receive proper care).

""On V8""... who even says it like that? Sure, they had the SL500 with a V8 (also the 63/600 with V12s), but there was also the V6 SL350. It makes pretty standard power for its displacement - except maybe those twin-turbo V12s, proper beasts.

""500R"" - that’s not a thing.

Maintenance is fairly reasonable, to be honest, at least for major components. The aforementioned air suspension tends to fail, but you can replace it with aftermarket coilovers and it’s fine. There are some weaknesses in certain engines, but nothing outrageous. In the end, it’s an old Merc - they go wrong and they cost money to fix. That’s not about being “powerful on V8”, it’s the same issues you’d get in a diesel E320CDI. These are problems of old cars, usually neglected, modified and run on tight budgets.

I wouldn’t say the R230 SL had fundamental quality issues or bad design. They’re actually fairly reliable as far as Mercs go, but they were loaded with tech - at this age, that tech fails. Also they sadly attract a certain type of buyer: show-offs, old geezers trying to look cool but with no money to maintain the car. They run it on a shoestring, rag it with cheap whores and it ends up trashed.

At one point, I really wanted one. I must’ve seen 15–20, and they were all disasters. And the sellers? Just mad... casually lying to your face or dodging direct questions, wasting your time.

Example: I call a guy two hours away. I say, “Look, it’s a two-hour drive, so I’ve got a few questions to save time for both of us. Has the car been smoked in?” “No.” “ABC works?” “Yeah.” “Any issues, engine lights, faults? I’ll be plugging it in on diagnostics.” “No, all good.”

I get there - dozens of burn marks on the seats, holes in the wind deflector, holes in the carpets, roof button missing (you have to stick your finger inside to press the switch), ABC light flashing. I’m like... “Mate, I asked you simple questions. I drove two hours and this is the car?” He goes - “I don’t know what you expect, it’s a 20-year-old car!”

Seriously?

Another one was bent like a banana. Cat-S, but nothing about it in listing. I asked, “Is everything okay with the car? Seems like a good deal for the mileage (38,000 miles).” “Yeah, all good.” I start looking - front grille broken, front bumper doesn’t match the colour, bonnet open and the fenders are completely misaligned with the body rails. I’m like, “WTF mate, it’s all bent.” He goes, “Ah yeah, it had a little accident.” And that wasn’t something you wanted to tell me?

And they’re all like that. So - it's not a bad car, but bad people tend to own them.

About 1 year and 2 months ago, my husband was driving a rental car alone. He accidentally scratched a parked car in a multi-storey car park. He was inexperienced at parking and felt pressured because several cars were waiting behind him, so he first moved to a safe spot on a higher floor. When he returned to the original spot a few minutes later, the other car had gone.  He should have called the police, but didn’t.

When returning the rental car, we reported the incident. He wasn’t insured, so the rental company charged £600, which we paid on the spot.

Later, we received a letter from the police asking to confirm if he was driving the car that day (the incident was caught on CCTV). We confirmed it.

It’s now been over a year, and nothing else has happened. We checked the DVLA and there are no driving offences or penalties recorded.

Now we’re about to buy a car and get insurance quotes, but we’re not sure how to answer these questions:

1. “Have you had any accidents, claims, or losses on your policy in the last 5 years?”
-> We didn’t make any insurance claim because it was a rental car and we paid the £600 directly. The rental company may have claimed on their insurance, but we assume this is not considered our claim. Can we answer No here?
	
2. “Have you committed any driving offences or had any Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs) in the last 5 years?”

1nv9ii5,I’ve been sold a salvage but unrecorded car,"I bought a car from a well known car retailer 4 years ago. (Big Motoring World) Did my HPI checks before pulling the trigger (car vertical - all clear) and paid market value. Back then the car was 2 years old. 4 years passed, I did 50K miles in the car, serviced it with the manufacturer and looked after it generally well. 
I thought I get a valuation for a PX and been told by the sales rep they found out my car is a stolen recovered vehicle (and offered nearly half of what I expected). They sent me a link to a website that indexes salvage auctions and it is clearly there. Its my car with a messed up substantial bodywork damage. Was quite shocked as you all can imagine. 
The listing states unrecorded stolen recovered. It happened when the car was 9 months old. I am the 4th owner so had 3 before me. One who broke it, one who fixed it (I guess) and the big retailer I bought it from. These are all assumptions based on research I did since this was revealed to me. 
Can someone explain how this can happen that a car that is stolen and recovered but its damage is not recorded? How can I insure it for its undamaged retail value? Also what can we - everyday people - do that this does not happen to us? Will all traders have access to the same information about my car? I can still HPI check it and it will be all clear.
Do I try to PX at BigMotoringWorld where I got it from 4 years ago? I don’t want to assume they didn’t know about it, but surely they have access to better data than me..

What was the damage? Was it properly repaired? You could have legal recourse to go to the dealer you bought the car from and try and get a compensation claim going - if they are a good dealer they could choose to refund you part of the price as a goodwill gesture and maybe agree to take the vehicle in part ex on a replacement (it is possible they didn’t know as it’s unrecorded if they did the basic checks andit came up clear) I would get in touch with a solicitor first to discuss your options, then I would civilly reach out to the dealer and explain the situation and see if they can offer you anything or a part ex deal as partial goodwill. And take it from there.

Don’t go off half cocked or indignant or assume they hid something from you be polite and explain the situation. Only if that doesn’t yield anything and a solicitor says you have a case would I then look at going full legal!

I’d also get in touch with the salvage auction and see if they are able to release any information about the circumstances they got the vehicle under - it sounds like a weird and unusual setup if it was stolen/recovered and then written off their should be official entries on the history. For it to be unrecorded would imply no insurance or police involvement so how did it get damaged an how do it end up at the auction! You’ve got a mystery car there mate very interesting! If you find any more facts let’s us know I love things like this!!! 

What’s the car by the way? Is it something that would be at high risk of theft? It could be the owner did something stupid damaged it then dumped it into an auction and set it was stolen/recovered so the auction house noted that and he sold it for wha the could get at auction an went on about his life and the buyer then repaired the car and sold it on. That would explain the “unrecorded”! And th stolen/recorded is just a ruse to cover a bruised ego cause he do something stupid and buggered his own vehicle and just dumped it at auction and went and got something else.

Your other option (not the option I’d take personally as I find this far more interesting because of the story) of course is advertise it privately at the price you want, hope a buyer comes along that doesn’t do proper due diligence and kick the problem down the line…"

I’ve got a budget of around £25,000 to buy, insure, Tax and a years service plan for a sports car. It must be a 2 door coupe, it must have around 200bhp or more, and that’s probably about it. I’m also looking for very low mileage but age isn’t an issue. Looking to own it for a couple of years before I move it onto someone else. 

I’ve found a 2006 Nissan 350Z and a 2019 Toyota GT86 who tick all the boxes and I’m going to give the owners a ring later to go have a look over the weekend (hopefully). They’re both under budget, after everything and running around the same cost.

The difference will be running costs and tax for the second year of ownership. £750 for the 350Z and £250 for the GT86. 

Obviously the 86 is the smart choice, but 3.5l V6 and 300bhp is just too tempting. 

Which one would you choose and why?

To clear up a few common misconceptions, Private Parking infringements fall under civil or contract law, no criminal offense has been committed. Other than an endless string of letters these firms can't take any action to recover the ""debt"" without a court order. This will only happen if you lose your case or a default judgement is made in favour of the claimant and you fail to pay. Again you are not going to end up with a CCJ for losing your case. Only if you fail to pay if ordered to do so by the court.

Costs are also rarely awarded to the claimant in the small claims court.

These firms make their money through the majority of people paying up. They do not like going to court one bit as it will cost them far more in solicitors fees than they stand to recover if they win the case. For this reason they  will (in most cases) try and reach a settlement out of court or cancel the PCN altogether.

So I took my Skoda citigo (2013) to the mechanic to replace the oil sump ( I over tightened the oil sump drain plug) as I was planning on selling it and we’d rather be honest to a seller, to say that I’m selling in a proper shape.
Basically he said he’d charge 70-100 pounds based on how much the task would need (taking off parts etc), I agreed. 
The next day he told me that he was struggling to remove 2 of the bolts as they have apparently rounded off; the previous owner may have fiddled with it, one was connected to the ac pump and the other was a bolt connected to the oil seal of the crank shaft (I think).
He proceeded to say it might cost more say up to 140 pounds which I said okay.
Eventually he snapped the bolt connected to the ac pump without damage .

I have raised a claim immediately with the insurance that afternoon. However in the evening, the driver Insurancer LV had also got in touch with me and asking if we wanted to proceed a claim with them on behalf of the driver. 

My question is, do I continue to proceed with my own insurance company or should I use the driver insurance LV to proceed with a claim?

1nuzts1,Car misfiring after Water Pump job,"Hi all,

Recently had a water leak on the car, turned out my water pump was leaking and radiator had also popped 🙃

Anyway, had those issues fixed and pretty much from the moment I picked the car up from the garage it didn’t feel right, idle was all over the place, I ignored it as I thought maybe it’s just because it hasn’t driven in over a week.

That was yesterday, this morning I’ve just driven it to work and again the idle was awful. Noticed a lack of power in acceleration and simply just a really rough drive, seems to me like it has a pretty hard misfire somewhere, to add to the inconvenience, both engine and Traction Control lights came on.

How would this link to having a radiator and water pump replaced? Or is it just my bad luck that it’s happened at the same time.

Thanks in advance

I would avoid the ishift Honda Civics as they have known reliability issues, no where near as prevalent on the Jazz, but still not good. They got the nickname i-shit and were eventually replaced by CVT boxes. Mazda2 is a good call, also the four-door Mitsubishi colts. You could probably pick up a Golf DSG in that range but likely going to be a banger.

1nuvvrg,Japanese Imports via UK Dealers - anything to worry about?,"Am looking at getting a used car - either an Audi A1 TFSI or a VW Golf GTI from the early/mid 2010s.

Looking through eBay and Autotrader, there seems to be some good prices in ones brought in from Japan and sold by UK dealers.

They've got UK registration plates so seems to have had all the paperwork done.

My understanding is that they're likely to have less rust due to less use of salt on the road in Japan and often seem to be  in good condition. And they're noticeably cheaper than UK cars.

Is there something I'm missing? ",4,1759283963.0,16,CartalkUK,1759433558,2025-10-01 01:59:23,2025-10-02 19:32:38,"vanceraa (Score: 7): Pretty much it yeah. You’ll need to get it undersealed properly to actually ensure it stays rust resistant, optionally you’ll want to ensure your head unit actually works with mapping etc, insurance will be more expensive as it’s an import. Selling it on will be more difficult as it won’t have full MOT history but not impossible.

Ziemniok_UwU (Score: 3): They generally have unknown history which on a German car is a big problem because if neglected they become money pits. They can also be more expensive to insure.
The upside is they tend to have be better specced and have less rust. 

The bigger issues is that TFSI engines and also the DSGs of that era were a total disaster in terms of reliability so make sure you get a post 2013 model and avoid a DSG paired with a sub 2L engine."
