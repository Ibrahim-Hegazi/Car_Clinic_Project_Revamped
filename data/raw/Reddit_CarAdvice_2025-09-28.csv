I checked the calipers, and the guide rods weren't seized. Neither was the caliper piston. One of the older guys at Oreilly and my girlfriends dad said that they think it might be the brake hose is collapsed. I bought new hoses for both sides, along with brake pads and rotors. The hoses that they gave me were the same length and had all of the same fittings on them. The only difference was the diameter of the new hose was smaller than the diameter of the hose that came off of my truck. I asked the guy at oreilly about this and he looked into it on a few different websites and they all said that the hose he gave me was the correct replacement. I also looked on rock auto and it looks like all of the replacements on there are the same size as the replacement that i bought (but the website doesn't specify what diameter the hose is).  I got the Pads, rotors, and new hoses installed then bled the brakes, and now when I drive my truck there is a burning rubber smell coming from the front brake area.

Hey everyone - I've been dealing with a pretty vexing situation with my truck and I'm hoping someone here with more experience can enlighten me. I keep getting error codes P0300, P0175 and P0155. My thinking (correct me if I am wrong) is that 175 and 300 are being caused by 155. I figured, the sensor is probably old, screw it let me replace it. No luck same exact codes are still visible after clearing, and the engine is still misfiring pretty heavily/ not mixing air and fuel properly. My working theory now is that there has to be an electrical issue, maybe blown fuse? I cant figure out which fuse or relay correlates with the o2 sensor though. 

For context before I was able to read the codes I was pretty much fumbling around in the dark, so I also replaced all 8 spark plugs and ignition coils (it was around that time anyway, and the coils were old and the rubber boots on some of them were damaged) along with the MAP sensor and coolant temp sensor just for kicks.

Either leaky injectors, or a stuck purge valve.  It starts fine cold because any excess fuel has drained to the crankcase past the piston rings or partially evaporated thru back thru the intake.  It starts on the second attempt when warm after the excess fuel vapor has been pulled thru and ejected into the exhaust.  Normally a stuck purge valve should set an evap code, but maybe that one isn't doing it for some reason.  And a leaking fuel injector probably won't set a code unless the leak is big enough to cause a misfire while the engine is running.  

Check the engine oil for any gasoline smell.  And next time you go to start it warm, try using ""clear flood mode"" by holding down the accelerator while starting.  This will turn off the injectors to let any excess vapor be pulled thru the engine.  Then lift off the accelerator and try starting normally.

You might have to pull the injectors and pressure test them to see if any are leaking and allowing fuel thru when they should be shut.

Any intermittent fault in the coils or ignition module should prevent it from starting that second time when warm.  If the problem was there, it wouldn't start until the engine is cooler, and I think it would probably shut off while running once the faulty part was warm enough."

1ns3nmm,Could faulty installation have caused my alternator mount failure?,"I'm not a car guy and I have a 2008 Chrysler Town and Country minivan. It's only at around 120k miles due to being the proverbial garage-kept one-trip-per-week grandma's car for the first half of its life.

I had a bad alternator replaced in July 2024. I heard squeaky belt noises start a couple months ago but didn't take any action (it's my wife's daily driver, and I forgot). I took it in to a different mechanic for a state safety inspection yesterday and they found that one of the alternator ear mounts had broken, damaging the timing cover and chewing through half the belt. When I told them the alternator was replaced a little over a year ago, they said they could observe a gap in the intact mount and they could slide multiple pieces of paper through it. They theorized that this mount wasn't fully tightened when the new alternator was installed, which caused undue strain on the other mount, eventually leading to catastrophic failure. They were surprised it was still running at all; they said the crowded area, fraying belt and sheer luck were all that were keeping the alternator approximately in place.

When I reported this to the mechanic (a full-service regional chain) that replaced the alternator, they reiterated their lifetime warranty on parts and labor and gave me instructions on how to have it towed to them at their expense. Today, I received a call from a different person at that garage who said we would need to wait until Monday for pricing and availability on a replacement ear mount (a dealer-only part), which led to a conversation about whether this would be covered under the lifetime warranty. This person said it would not be covered because they didn't replace the ear mounts with the new alternator, just the alternator itself. When I explained the diagnosis of the other mechanics, which was that an improperly tightened mount was the likely cause of the other mount's failure, this person said it was implausible to suggest that something like that could happen more than a year after installation. He said that if it had happened just a week or two after installation, it would be different, but under these circumstances it's only reasonable to deduce that the mount simply broke on its own.

Both garages are now closed until Monday, when I have to try to persuade the garage that replaced the alternator to cover these repairs under their lifetime warranty on the labor. So I'm curious what experienced gearheads think about these two explanations before I have that conversation.

1nrwzbw,Pull to the right during acceleration after control arm replacement,"I have a Honda Pilot 2017 and had the control arms replaced recently. After the replacement, I noticed a pull to the right when accelerating, especially at high speeds. I took it back to my mechanic and they said they replaced one of the control arms after confirming there was some pull in there (?). But shit, it still does it. I don't think it did it before the control arms were replaced as I just started noticing it afterwards.

I think the mechanic I go to is decent and what are the odds of them looking at the car, replacing the control arms, then looking at it again, then replacing another control arm again, and there still being a problem?  They did an alignment during that process as well.

Thoughts on what I should do?  I feel like a crazy person taking it back in a 3rd time and saying there's still an issue, but maybe that's just what I need to do.

1nrsaau,2018 Audi Q5 2.0T Cooling issue,"Hello. 

I'm having a serious issue with the cooling system.

Backstory:
 wife was driving home from work on day and about 5mins from the house she said it started to ""puff smoke"". She then drove it home and then told me. The temp gauge was on red for a little, as a way to cool the engine and to find the source of the leak I put Tap water into it. I found the leak and it was the Y Pipe going from the engine to the Radiator and the heater.I replaced the Y pipe with a Audi Genuine part.

Upon replacing the part, I decided doing a coolant system flush was needed which I did. I drained the water out of the engine from the lower radiator hose and put the bottle of flush into the reservoir and then distilled water until the reservoir was at max and ran it. At first it started bubbling from the reservoir as if was boiling, it then started to pour out the over flow valve from the reservoir, I stopped the engine, waited like 10-15mins for it to cool, topped it off with more distilled water into it, squeezed the upper radiator hose a few times and started the engine again and it was fine. 

Now:
I ran to Walmart to get the required coolant and came back, drained the coolant, opened the reservoir cap and let the system drain. I closed off the lower radiator hose, poured the coolant into the system and topped it off and now to the point where it's reliable, it keeps boiling in the reservoir.

 I'll shut the engine off
Pour coolant into the reservoir
Turn on engine with heat on full blast
Run the engine (it will run completely fine at idle under operating temp, as soon as it's help at 2k RPMs or over past like 4mins it will start to boil in the reservoir)
*Begins to boil*
Shut off engine
Will let sit for 5mins
Unscrew cap and will repeat

There is a crack in the cap of the reservoir from what I noticed (this doesn't have a dipstick or bleeder valve for the radiator) 

If any help can be given it would be greatly appreciated.

Then lied to one of them about what the other offered me and ended up getting $1800 for it. Decided to stop there and not push it. 

Mind you, the engine is completely gone. Not a gearhead by any means but I lifted the hood and literally saw snapped and broken pieces of metal at the bottom. One looked like the thing that holds up a piston, but not sure. 

Rest of the car is in decent shape. Interior was filthy but not damaged. Cosmetic paint damage but no dents at all. 

Did I get ripped off or make out okay on this sale?

EDIT: before anyone asks, I did check the VIN for recalls. ",1,1758980867.0,4,CarTalk,1759087932,2025-09-27 13:47:47,2025-09-28 19:32:12,"amazinghl (Score: 3): Worth $1,800.

Some we still have some we've eventually sold. Some not shown in the pictures are Passat B6, Caddy, Bora (Jetta Mk4), Golf 5+ and another Skoda Octavia (sedan). And although we're generally happy with the Vag brands we thought we give some other brand a try as well, switch things up a little. I found this 93 from 2006 with very low mileage and wel maintained and we bought it. I'd heard good things about Saabs overal package and the 1.9 tid it came with. The first drive home felt good. But soon as the novelty wore off I started feeling that my Audi was much better. Later on I thought the Passat was better too then the Bora and so on. And when I say beter I mean beter handling , beter gear shifting experience, better chassis almost everything better. Not a bad car by a long shot but still underwhelming when compared to my other cars. But still Saab fanatics swear by these cars. You can't tell them some other fwd sedan is better than their precious Saab. They love these cars with a passion. And they'll go on and on praising these cars about their handling which isn't bad. But they have massive amounts of body roll, loose steering feel, and not very smooth on the highway neither. The gear shifts aren't slick and the clutch feel is mediocre. The chassis feels loose and to top it all of fuel economy is scandalous.

Most of the time its just done for looks with a very small incremental performance benefit. Owner is happy, wheel store is happy, a million people with them in traffic, no big deal. 

For all the money spent, it opens the door to issues few understand and can result in worse performance. First issue is incorrect backset, the number of times 4WD owners complain of tires rubbing with new rims is high - they needed to select the rim on its spacing, not its looks, and if they ordered wider ones, then the stock backset would even be wrong. Tire and rim shops rarely can do much about it and don't want to lose the sale, sometimes they add spacers which seem to help until studs start braking. 

Another issue is going up in rim diameter, which tends to have lower profile tires selected to keep the speedometer police from flashing their colorful lights. Larger diameter tires require correction, and whether with a new cable gear or reprogramming the EFI, its not often done. And for every inch increase in diameter, it generally adds another pound of dead weight which means measurably slower acceleration from weight alone, plus the alteration in overall gear ratio. Braking is affected, it takes more road to stop. The overall result, car or truck, is WORSE performance. Its because we don't understand what physics we changed in the effort to make the car look more performance oriented without understanding what was really involved. It was done for looks. 

Goes to an off road vehicle needed more traction would be better off with a locking differential first, not aggressive large tires which actually help little and require the locker up front anyway, with a gear ratio change front and rear, too. That usually costs 2x the new rims and tires - but, we dont got no money fo dat. So the trails are filled with vehicles that look capable but really are worse off than factory stock. Same for sporty cars, too. Wide low profile tires on a damp curvy backroad  in fall = deforestation.

The PCM turns on the field circuit for the alternator and only does so at a certain rpm just say 551rpm so if you have a low idle of say 550rpm the PCM shuts off the field circuit. That's 90% of the time the problem. 


Disconnect the battery ground cable and clean your throttle body, reassemble everything and start the car. Having the battery disconnected should have reset the throttle plate angle position in the PCM. 

Start it up and let it run until it warms up it should relearn by then. (If not look it up, some require a different sequence of events)

Either way it should fix the flickering light."

Do you know how to check for a Parasitic draw? You're going to need a test light. 

Remove the negative battery cable. Attach the alligator clip to the negative battery cable then tough the probe to the negative battery terminal. If the light is on your drawing current. 

Now you want to locate what component is drawing electricity, systematically pull out a fuse, do the test again, as long as the test light is on something is still drawing current. You'll know what circuit is constantly drawing when the test light goes out.

Works great no matter which terminal (+ or -) you touch the test light tip to...with the alligator clip/lead to the other (usually negative) terminal (shows a minus sign voltage if reversed).

Too bad it doesn't self-power-up on 1.5v .. if so I would use it to read AA AAA C D batteries too.

If parasitic draw were the problem... You could disconnect the negative battery terminal every night and reattach before next mission. I know..pain ....

But you want to see the voltage while idling at least... alternator should be delivering around 14v... across battery terminals (ARE YOURS really CLEAN,right?) .. same test points (batt terminals ) as watching the battery.

Usually if you have 12.0v more or less on a cold battery, it will crank your starter (and battery experiences a quick voltage drop to 10 or 11v while cranking.. you'd need a second person to observe that, and you still wouldn't know how many amps your starter is drawing...if under 150-200 amp draw, probably starter is ok)."

Generally the only way to fix an engine with sounds like that is to rebuild the engine, no additive is going to ‚Äòfix‚Äô it

66NickS (Score: 2): I‚Äôve always known piston slap to be excessive clearance between the piston and the cylinder, allowing it to rock or slap back and forth laterally. Unless you‚Äôre describing something different, spark plugs and fuel additives are unlikely to change this.  If you do have piston slap, the correction is a rebuild. 

Is the noise louder or quieter when you free rev the engine?  Typically rod knock gets louder under load which might be what you‚Äôre hearing, but that‚Äôs just a wild guess."

1ns9tu1,Light Bar wiring help. Trigger wire confusion.,"Trying to install a small light bar on my son's 2014 Toyota Corolla. I've successfully done this for my Hilux, my motorcycle and my other son's Rav4, this one is killing me. 

The kit came with a ready made harness, including an adapter to plug into the back of the head lamp. The adapter doesn't work because the high beam operates on a mechanical reflector change inside the headlight assembly. I have located the trigger wire with a test lamp and can (with great difficulty) splice into this wire. 

The adapter has both black and red wires leading into the harness. Using a multimeter, I checked resistance across all wires. I would typically use just a single wire from the high beam to run to relay pin 86. I tested this from the black (negative) adapter wire input and it shows zero resistance when the light bar switch is 'on', no reading when 'off'. So far so good. 

My confusion stems from the red (positive) adapter wire input. This is permanently linked to pin 85. Shouldn't this be be grounded? The adapter would have it also connected to the high beam wire. 

Splicing the high beam trigger is going to be a painful exercise so I don't want to proceed until I'm sure. I think it will be OK if I connect the red input wire to ground, the black input wire to the high beam and the other pins as per their respective plugs.

It happened, by chance, just a couple of blocks from the Honda dealer, so took it there for diagnosis.  Technician said one cylinder was misfiring; said that cylinder had watery liquid on the ignition coil and in the spark plug tube.  Also coolant was low, ""radiator wasn't full.""

They suspected the cooling system might be somehow leaking into one cylinder, so did a pressure test, but said no leak was detected.  Said the originally wet coil would still misfire when the engine warmed up, so urged replacing it.  OK, guess so.

The mystery that remains:  how would watery liquid get into one cylinder?  I assume the dealership would have been happy to find a leak in the cooling system if there was one, so probably not that.

Octane rating - This rating measures the fuel's ability to resist knocking in an engine, with higher numbers indicating greater resistance to premature ignition.

Basically, it doesn't make the fuel burn faster, hotter or make more power... Higher octane ratings prevents ignition prior to when the spark occurs, or pre-ignition (or ""knocking""), which can be devastating to an engine in some cases, and it allows for higher compression ratios, more advanced timing, etc.

Higher octane rating by itself does not increase power, torque, or give any other improvement to the engine unless it was being de-tuned for lower grade fuel. 

In it's most basic form, it actually prevents the gas from igniting as soon without affecting how fast/hot it burns, so it is no surprise it isn't flammable by itself."

1nrsasd,2018 Audi Q5 2.0T Cooling issue,"Hello. 

I'm having a serious issue with the cooling system.

Backstory:
 wife was driving home from work on day and about 5mins from the house she said it started to ""puff smoke"". She then drove it home and then told me. The temp gauge was on red for a little, as a way to cool the engine and to find the source of the leak I put Tap water into it. I found the leak and it was the Y Pipe going from the engine to the Radiator and the heater.I replaced the Y pipe with a Audi Genuine part.

Upon replacing the part, I decided doing a coolant system flush was needed which I did. I drained the water out of the engine from the lower radiator hose and put the bottle of flush into the reservoir and then distilled water until the reservoir was at max and ran it. At first it started bubbling from the reservoir as if was boiling, it then started to pour out the over flow valve from the reservoir, I stopped the engine, waited like 10-15mins for it to cool, topped it off with more distilled water into it, squeezed the upper radiator hose a few times and started the engine again and it was fine. 

Now:
I ran to Walmart to get the required coolant and came back, drained the coolant, opened the reservoir cap and let the system drain. I closed off the lower radiator hose, poured the coolant into the system and topped it off and now to the point where it's reliable, it keeps boiling in the reservoir.

 I'll shut the engine off
Pour coolant into the reservoir
Turn on engine with heat on full blast
Run the engine (it will run completely fine at idle under operating temp, as soon as it's help at 2k RPMs or over past like 4mins it will start to boil in the reservoir)
*Begins to boil*
Shut off engine
Will let sit for 5mins
Unscrew cap and will repeat

There is a crack in the cap of the reservoir from what I noticed (this doesn't have a dipstick or bleeder valve for the radiator)

The gauge is part of a whole computer for the instrument panel and they don't usually fail partially liike that (you'd more likely lose the whole panel), however it will read zero if it's not getting any data and this is one of the variables the car uses to know fuel/air mix, valve timing etc. Without this input, the ECU will likely throw an error code (the check engine light) and is probably why it runs weirdly, as the engine computer doesn't really have any idea what is going on if it doesn't know how fast the engine is spinning. 

I'm not familiar with the layout of Dodges, but there's a chance that the cable to the sensor was damaged or disconnected during the alt service. If it's a well designed vehicle, fixing/replacing the sensor will probably be pretty cheap (unless there's a lot of labour due to annoying design :/ )"

Or put more parts on to fix it, probably need control arms to compensate for the lift.

Able-Craft-6449 (Score: 1): you'll need a set of aftermarket upper control arms (UCAs) that provide more adjustment range than your current setup allows, as ball joint spacers and maxed-out stock UCAs are insufficient for a lift of this height. A lift of 3 inches significantly alters the suspension geometry, necessitating upgraded UCAs to restore proper alignment and maintain safety. 
Why You Have a Problem
Altered Suspension Geometry:
A 3-inch lift changes the angle of your suspension components, which puts the upper and lower control arms at an extreme angle. 
Ball Joint Spacer Limitations:
A 2-inch ball joint spacer on a stock UCA can't provide the necessary adjustment range for a 3-inch lift. 
Positive Camber:
This excessive positive camber means the top of your wheels are leaning outward, leading to unsafe driving conditions and poor tire wear. 
How to Correct It
Install Aftermarket UCAs: The most effective solution is to replace your current bolt-in UCAs with aftermarket UCAs specifically designed for lifted vehicles. These UCAs have a different design that allows for greater adjustment of camber and other alignment angles.
Achieve Proper Alignment:
Once the new UCAs are installed, a professional alignment will be required to correctly adjust the camber, caster, and toe settings.
The new UCAs will provide the necessary adjustment range for the technician to set your alignment to factory specifications. 
Important Considerations
Safety:
Driving with an incorrect alignment due to a lifted suspension can be unsafe, so it's crucial to address the alignment properly. 
Ride Quality:
Upgrading the UCAs will also improve the performance and ride quality of your lifted Tahoe. 
Professional Alignment:
Always have a qualified alignment technician perform the final alignment after installing new suspension components."

1nrgyp4,Does this sound like a healthy engine ?,"

Hello all,

Car is a 2009 Ford Escape 3.0 V6 AWD with about 248000 miles. Father in law gave it to us for free after taking very good care of if for 15 years, although he states that by the end it cost too much to keep fixing everything so the brief for his mechanic was ""do the minimum to keep it running and nothing more."" It always had regular oil changes.

Since I received it, I did a full tune up with new plugs and coils, new PCV, new canister purge valve, cleaned the throttle body and EGR, new oil and filters, transmission flush and ran some concentrated injector cleaner through the fuel system. That fixed the codes and driveability issues (was misfiring a lot and sounded like the worst diesel), all I can notice now  is a slightly worn engine mount and very slight rpm drops when letting go of gas when revving or turning the steering wheel.


 I don't really know where to take it from here. The car drives fine and vibration level is about what you'd  expect from such a high mileage car. My main question is, is it worth putting some more money into the car to fix everything ? It would need a full suspension overhaul and all the engine gaskets/manifolds done to stop some oil and exhaust leaks. I priced all of that on Rockauto for about $800, which I could afford and do myself if it meant the car was reliable and trustworthy again.

Video shows cold start, shifting through gears, some 2k rpm revs on neutral then some revs in drive with foot on the brake.

Apart from swapping the transmission or engine, I feel like I could keep fixing all the smaller things that end up breaking, there is tons of videos on working on the car and I'm quite handy around it at this point.

Here would be my questions: 

- Does the engine sound normal for a 3.0 Duratec ?
- Does it need new engine and trans mounts ?
- How much more can this engine give if I keep changing the oil every 4k miles ? Granted I spend $800-1000 to fix everything it needs, can I trust it to drive very long distances (thinking on going on a road trip) ? 

My wife also drives the car so reliability is very important to me. In law says it would be a waste to pour money into it and have it fail in a couple thousand miles but I feel like the engine and trans are heathy enough to try.

1ns3oko,GT86 vs F22 M240i (Mental Supra and M2 fans need not comment),"Hi all. Just need some input from prior owners on these two cars. My intention is to daily them (I work fully remote so usage will be low). Wanted a coupe and sportier car since I'm a petrol-head and struggle to really pick between these two. Right now, a good example of either car seems to be anywhere between ¬£18K - ¬£20K, they're both generally reliable and both generally eat fuel at the same rate, so it more comes down to fun vs comfort.

I understand many say the GT86 is one of the most fun and best handling cars, though the torque dip does seem to be a real issue, even just if overtaking, and the general ride, cabin noise and interior make it fairly unpleasant on longer journeys. Though it is at least also a rare and more interesting car.

By comparison the F22 M240i is apparently much faster, much more comfortable, has usable back seats should you need them, but apparently from what I've been reading has awful handling and totally dead steering. It is also just another 2-series BMW on the road.

Trying to parse fans, remorseful buyers, badge-shaggers ( I sware some of you take commission trying to push sales of M2s/Supras) and dramatic takes has been extremely hard, and really hoping for some concise insight if I can get some.

Bonus question: I've seen *a lot* of people say that an M2x0i is a nonce's car/chav car. I have no idea where this comes from. Is there a regional association I'm not aware of or is this just more insane badge-shaggery from ""real"" M-cars fans?",1,1759000503.0,21,CartalkUK,1759087932,2025-09-27 19:15:03,2025-09-28 19:32:12,"InViewOfNothing (Score: 5): GT86 is an excellent car ruined by the arthritic Subaru boxer it was saddled with.

For twisty country roads with low top speeds but prioritising driver involvement I‚Äôd take a GT86.

I was told that any faults could be addressed under warranty by my local dealer, unfortunately an Arnold Clark.

The car was making this weird squeak sound when coming off/on the power. My local dealer had the car in to check it out. They took apart and reassembled the rear brakes and told me it was fine. The squeak was still there, and I have now realised that this is caused by the exhaust valve opening and closing.

Unfortunately, ever since they messed with the brakes they have started squeaking at low speeds, and are now slightly binding when first setting off and after firm application of the brakes. The car went in for a diff service, and I asked them to investigate this at the same time.

I was told that they would have to charge me to remedy the problem they caused because the brakes aren't covered under warranty. I asked how much it would be, and they told me 'dunno we'd have to look at it'. Needless to say they didn't, and they didn't quote me a price either. They did give me a nice leaflet explaining how shit M Sport brakes are though.

So now I have a car with two small annoying issues. It's been to the dealer about 5 times now for this. Quite why they think they now have to charge me for the brakes, when they did this work without me asking previously for free and caused the problem, I don't know.

Want to buy a car, and I‚Äôm looking for something small, nippy and under 20k. Preferably a new-ish hatch or a slightly older coupe with a manual gearbox (that does not wear a Mazda badge!) 

I‚Äôve been quite interested in one of these F22 2-series. I just don‚Äôt know if I should go for 218i, 218d or just spend my money elsewhere?

You can get an M235i or M240i for under 20k but would need to do your due diligence on the car history and factor in insurance costs, premium tyres etc, . Alternatives Leon Cupra/Golf R/S3 can get a good example of any of those for under 20k with good selection of extras. For me personally if I was spending up to 20k I would be looking for something that offers a bit more for my money in terms of performance if you are looking for something a bit quicker than your standard car.

Your best bet is to have a look on auto trader really because there are loads of cars like the ones you want. The VW Golf, Hyundai i30 are some standard shouts but like I said there are tons of options.

MDKrouzer (Score: 1): Two questions here:

1. Which car? Depends on what your main use case is. Long or short commute? Just you or family of 4+? Any hobbies that could use a bigger car?

2. How to pay for it? Depends on your financial situation? Barely scraping by? Lots of disposable income? Aiming to buy a house soon?

Edit: a third question to ask is why do you need a new car? Has your use case changed significantly that the Chevy is not suitable anymore? Is the Chevy on its last legs or costing you too much to maintain?"
1nrq0b1,What TLC for CLA?,"I've recently got very close to trading my 9yr 80k MB 220D CLA for a nearly new hybrid.

The low trade in price for it, and the fact it would be an extra ¬£22k (Inc finance) for a 2 year old quashqai has made me change my mind, and I will now keep it for at least a couple of years. 

I also can't believe the tax on a mid range hybrid is ¬£620 compared to ¬£20 for my dirty diesel, but sure that has been discussed here before.

Anyway now I am keeping it I wondered if there is anything I can do to ensure the engine is optimised. I have ensured fsh but never used diesel additive, and not sure if makes any difference to start now. I have no warning lights but the engine does feel loud to my untrained ear.

As it happens, the car is located at a dealer not far from me.

1nrp7s2,Sold a car from salvage auction,"So, bit of a long winded one this but I need some help. Nearly 3 years ago I financed a BMW 440i m sport from a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù who sourced me the car from his dealership. He told me the car had some front end damage that had been repaired. Long story short the car was sold at salvage auction on 27/07/2022. He never disclosed this nor was I shown the damage. He said any issues he would take car of, as when I received the car from the dealership there was a fair amount of warning lights on it. Long story short again he had the car back many times always coming up with a new excuse as to why he couldn‚Äôt sort, massive time waster.

So I recently ran an in-depth HPI check to fund out the salvage history and the photos etc. I have been mis- sold this car 100% and wasn‚Äôt given the full facts and never in my right mind would I finance a car that had serious damage ( trust me it is not minor damage it was bad the whole front end was off) I‚Äôm amazed the dealership sourced me this car without disclosing any of this to me the only thing i was told by him was that it had front end damage but was ‚Äúprofessionally‚Äù sorted.

Now, nearly 3 years on I want rid and to my horror find out all of this now. I feel as though I am stuck with this car as I am paying the car finance still, I have listed it for sale and have been very transparent but obviously the history quickly deters potential buyers. I have e-mailed the finance company with a little help from chat-gbt basically saying I‚Äôm in my rights here and was mis sold etc. How could they be ok with this car been financed with the issues it has.

1nrkh2r,Winter tyres in Scotland question,"Hi there, I‚Äôm wondering if you good people could help me with something. In March of this year my girlfriend and I bought an almost new BMW 118i (74 reg).

Add to that the variable winter temps we can get, one day it might be cold enough to justify winter tyres, the next it's freakishly warm for the middle of winter.

All seasons carrying the 3PMSF are probably going to be the least amount of hassle, and given the variable weather we often experience, all seasons are probably the best suited to our climate.

How well you'll cope really depends on the local geography though. Contrary to Reddit belief, you're not going to spontaneously skate everywhere and hit 47 trees just because you've got summer tyres on. But all seasons will provide at least some level of improvement in the winter over summers. Winters even more so, but that then comes with extra hassle and expense of having two sets of tyres.
