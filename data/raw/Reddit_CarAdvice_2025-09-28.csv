Recently, my dad who was a enthusiast of automotive mechanics, ecus and key programming, sadly passed away. He didn’t had a shop, he was learning and sometimes went to a shop of one of his friends to learn and practice. He worked in another stuff.

Among those stuff he left many ECUs that I have identify which car they belong with the help of AI (and verifying the information). 
However, the AI told me that if I can read those ECUs VIN’s, I can sell the ECUs more expensive. 
My dad has a Godiag banc or whatever it’s called and I am using an AUTEL MaxiCom Mk908 to scan the ecus VIN… I have read some , but I don’t know if it’s worth the work to read every ECU, or just sell them like that.

I've got this late 80's early 90's 80hp mercury 2-stroke that has been working great then I take it out the next weekend and it starts but does when I shift.

1ns75f7,"Mercedes C300 W205 – Temp Gauge Maxed Out, White Goo in Radiator","Picked up a 2016 Mercedes C300 (W205) from auction with ~85k miles. Drove it about 50 miles home and it ran great, no overheating.

Next morning I started it up, and the temp gauge instantly shot all the way to hot. I popped the hood — coolant wasn’t boiling, engine didn’t feel crazy hot. I figured thermostat, so I swapped it. While doing that, I found a bunch of white goo/sludge in the radiator (looked like chunks of something mixed in). I flushed as much out as I could.

Now, even with the new thermostat, the gauge still pegs hot immediately after startup. The car still drives fine otherwise.

My questions:
	•	Is this more likely a bad temp sensor/cluster issue than actual overheating?
	•	Could the water pump or fan cause this?
	•	Could that white sludge be stop-leak or coolant contamination from the previous owner?

I checked the calipers, and the guide rods weren't seized. Neither was the caliper piston. One of the older guys at Oreilly and my girlfriends dad said that they think it might be the brake hose is collapsed. I bought new hoses for both sides, along with brake pads and rotors. The hoses that they gave me were the same length and had all of the same fittings on them. The only difference was the diameter of the new hose was smaller than the diameter of the hose that came off of my truck. I asked the guy at oreilly about this and he looked into it on a few different websites and they all said that the hose he gave me was the correct replacement. I also looked on rock auto and it looks like all of the replacements on there are the same size as the replacement that i bought (but the website doesn't specify what diameter the hose is).  I got the Pads, rotors, and new hoses installed then bled the brakes, and now when I drive my truck there is a burning rubber smell coming from the front brake area.

Hey everyone - I've been dealing with a pretty vexing situation with my truck and I'm hoping someone here with more experience can enlighten me. I keep getting error codes P0300, P0175 and P0155. My thinking (correct me if I am wrong) is that 175 and 300 are being caused by 155. I figured, the sensor is probably old, screw it let me replace it. No luck same exact codes are still visible after clearing, and the engine is still misfiring pretty heavily/ not mixing air and fuel properly. My working theory now is that there has to be an electrical issue, maybe blown fuse? I cant figure out which fuse or relay correlates with the o2 sensor though. 

For context before I was able to read the codes I was pretty much fumbling around in the dark, so I also replaced all 8 spark plugs and ignition coils (it was around that time anyway, and the coils were old and the rubber boots on some of them were damaged) along with the MAP sensor and coolant temp sensor just for kicks.

Either leaky injectors, or a stuck purge valve.  It starts fine cold because any excess fuel has drained to the crankcase past the piston rings or partially evaporated thru back thru the intake.  It starts on the second attempt when warm after the excess fuel vapor has been pulled thru and ejected into the exhaust.  Normally a stuck purge valve should set an evap code, but maybe that one isn't doing it for some reason.  And a leaking fuel injector probably won't set a code unless the leak is big enough to cause a misfire while the engine is running.  

Check the engine oil for any gasoline smell.  And next time you go to start it warm, try using ""clear flood mode"" by holding down the accelerator while starting.  This will turn off the injectors to let any excess vapor be pulled thru the engine.  Then lift off the accelerator and try starting normally.

You might have to pull the injectors and pressure test them to see if any are leaking and allowing fuel thru when they should be shut.

Any intermittent fault in the coils or ignition module should prevent it from starting that second time when warm.  If the problem was there, it wouldn't start until the engine is cooler, and I think it would probably shut off while running once the faulty part was warm enough."

1ns3nmm,Could faulty installation have caused my alternator mount failure?,"I'm not a car guy and I have a 2008 Chrysler Town and Country minivan. It's only at around 120k miles due to being the proverbial garage-kept one-trip-per-week grandma's car for the first half of its life.

I had a bad alternator replaced in July 2024. I heard squeaky belt noises start a couple months ago but didn't take any action (it's my wife's daily driver, and I forgot). I took it in to a different mechanic for a state safety inspection yesterday and they found that one of the alternator ear mounts had broken, damaging the timing cover and chewing through half the belt. When I told them the alternator was replaced a little over a year ago, they said they could observe a gap in the intact mount and they could slide multiple pieces of paper through it. They theorized that this mount wasn't fully tightened when the new alternator was installed, which caused undue strain on the other mount, eventually leading to catastrophic failure. They were surprised it was still running at all; they said the crowded area, fraying belt and sheer luck were all that were keeping the alternator approximately in place.

When I reported this to the mechanic (a full-service regional chain) that replaced the alternator, they reiterated their lifetime warranty on parts and labor and gave me instructions on how to have it towed to them at their expense. Today, I received a call from a different person at that garage who said we would need to wait until Monday for pricing and availability on a replacement ear mount (a dealer-only part), which led to a conversation about whether this would be covered under the lifetime warranty. This person said it would not be covered because they didn't replace the ear mounts with the new alternator, just the alternator itself. When I explained the diagnosis of the other mechanics, which was that an improperly tightened mount was the likely cause of the other mount's failure, this person said it was implausible to suggest that something like that could happen more than a year after installation. He said that if it had happened just a week or two after installation, it would be different, but under these circumstances it's only reasonable to deduce that the mount simply broke on its own.

Both garages are now closed until Monday, when I have to try to persuade the garage that replaced the alternator to cover these repairs under their lifetime warranty on the labor. So I'm curious what experienced gearheads think about these two explanations before I have that conversation.

I’m experiencing two strange electrical issues with my VW T4 Multivan and could use some advice or insights from the community. Here’s what’s happening:

Issue 1: Beeping Sound Issue

Normally, the beeping sound should only activate when the headlights are on, the key is removed, and the driver’s door is opened. However, in my case, when the driver’s door is open, the engine is off, the key is out of the ignition, and the light switch is in any position, activating either the left or right turn signal triggers the beeping sound. Has anyone experienced this issue before? Could it be caused by a faulty sensor, a wiring problem, or something else?

Issue 2: Dashboard illumination. 

When the driver’s door is closed and the key is in the “ignition on” position, with the light switch set to: position lights or headlights/low beam (the dashboard illumination doesn’t work in either setting). However, when I activate the left or right turn signal, the dashboard lights suddenly turn on. Any ideas what might be causing this?

1nrwzbw,Pull to the right during acceleration after control arm replacement,"I have a Honda Pilot 2017 and had the control arms replaced recently. After the replacement, I noticed a pull to the right when accelerating, especially at high speeds. I took it back to my mechanic and they said they replaced one of the control arms after confirming there was some pull in there (?). But shit, it still does it. I don't think it did it before the control arms were replaced as I just started noticing it afterwards.

I think the mechanic I go to is decent and what are the odds of them looking at the car, replacing the control arms, then looking at it again, then replacing another control arm again, and there still being a problem?  They did an alignment during that process as well.

Thoughts on what I should do?  I feel like a crazy person taking it back in a 3rd time and saying there's still an issue, but maybe that's just what I need to do.

I've read about torque steer, but have also read a 2017 pilot shouldn't have the issue as it has even-length front drive axles.

Older vehicle sat for many years. Currently when driving the throttle pedal is feels sticky. It never gets stuck, so no safety issue, but I am unable to smoothly modulate the position.

I have pulled the pedal itself and lubricantes the articulation and whole that helped some it did not solve the issue.

1nrsaau,2018 Audi Q5 2.0T Cooling issue,"Hello. 

I'm having a serious issue with the cooling system.

Backstory:
 wife was driving home from work on day and about 5mins from the house she said it started to ""puff smoke"". She then drove it home and then told me. The temp gauge was on red for a little, as a way to cool the engine and to find the source of the leak I put Tap water into it. I found the leak and it was the Y Pipe going from the engine to the Radiator and the heater.I replaced the Y pipe with a Audi Genuine part.

Upon replacing the part, I decided doing a coolant system flush was needed which I did. I drained the water out of the engine from the lower radiator hose and put the bottle of flush into the reservoir and then distilled water until the reservoir was at max and ran it. At first it started bubbling from the reservoir as if was boiling, it then started to pour out the over flow valve from the reservoir, I stopped the engine, waited like 10-15mins for it to cool, topped it off with more distilled water into it, squeezed the upper radiator hose a few times and started the engine again and it was fine. 

Now:
I ran to Walmart to get the required coolant and came back, drained the coolant, opened the reservoir cap and let the system drain. I closed off the lower radiator hose, poured the coolant into the system and topped it off and now to the point where it's reliable, it keeps boiling in the reservoir.

 I'll shut the engine off
Pour coolant into the reservoir
Turn on engine with heat on full blast
Run the engine (it will run completely fine at idle under operating temp, as soon as it's help at 2k RPMs or over past like 4mins it will start to boil in the reservoir)
*Begins to boil*
Shut off engine
Will let sit for 5mins
Unscrew cap and will repeat

There is a crack in the cap of the reservoir from what I noticed (this doesn't have a dipstick or bleeder valve for the radiator) 

If any help can be given it would be greatly appreciated.

Some we still have some we've eventually sold. Some not shown in the pictures are Passat B6, Caddy, Bora (Jetta Mk4), Golf 5+ and another Skoda Octavia (sedan). And although we're generally happy with the Vag brands we thought we give some other brand a try as well, switch things up a little. I found this 93 from 2006 with very low mileage and wel maintained and we bought it. I'd heard good things about Saabs overal package and the 1.9 tid it came with. The first drive home felt good. But soon as the novelty wore off I started feeling that my Audi was much better. Later on I thought the Passat was better too then the Bora and so on. And when I say beter I mean beter handling , beter gear shifting experience, better chassis almost everything better. Not a bad car by a long shot but still underwhelming when compared to my other cars. But still Saab fanatics swear by these cars. You can't tell them some other fwd sedan is better than their precious Saab. They love these cars with a passion. And they'll go on and on praising these cars about their handling which isn't bad. But they have massive amounts of body roll, loose steering feel, and not very smooth on the highway neither. The gear shifts aren't slick and the clutch feel is mediocre. The chassis feels loose and to top it all of fuel economy is scandalous.

Most of the time its just done for looks with a very small incremental performance benefit. Owner is happy, wheel store is happy, a million people with them in traffic, no big deal. 

For all the money spent, it opens the door to issues few understand and can result in worse performance. First issue is incorrect backset, the number of times 4WD owners complain of tires rubbing with new rims is high - they needed to select the rim on its spacing, not its looks, and if they ordered wider ones, then the stock backset would even be wrong. Tire and rim shops rarely can do much about it and don't want to lose the sale, sometimes they add spacers which seem to help until studs start braking. 

Another issue is going up in rim diameter, which tends to have lower profile tires selected to keep the speedometer police from flashing their colorful lights. Larger diameter tires require correction, and whether with a new cable gear or reprogramming the EFI, its not often done. And for every inch increase in diameter, it generally adds another pound of dead weight which means measurably slower acceleration from weight alone, plus the alteration in overall gear ratio. Braking is affected, it takes more road to stop. The overall result, car or truck, is WORSE performance. Its because we don't understand what physics we changed in the effort to make the car look more performance oriented without understanding what was really involved. It was done for looks. 

Goes to an off road vehicle needed more traction would be better off with a locking differential first, not aggressive large tires which actually help little and require the locker up front anyway, with a gear ratio change front and rear, too. That usually costs 2x the new rims and tires - but, we dont got no money fo dat. So the trails are filled with vehicles that look capable but really are worse off than factory stock. Same for sporty cars, too. Wide low profile tires on a damp curvy backroad  in fall = deforestation.

Do you know how to check for a Parasitic draw? You're going to need a test light. 

Remove the negative battery cable. Attach the alligator clip to the negative battery cable then tough the probe to the negative battery terminal. If the light is on your drawing current. 

Now you want to locate what component is drawing electricity, systematically pull out a fuse, do the test again, as long as the test light is on something is still drawing current. You'll know what circuit is constantly drawing when the test light goes out.

Works great no matter which terminal (+ or -) you touch the test light tip to...with the alligator clip/lead to the other (usually negative) terminal (shows a minus sign voltage if reversed).

Too bad it doesn't self-power-up on 1.5v .. if so I would use it to read AA AAA C D batteries too.

If parasitic draw were the problem... You could disconnect the negative battery terminal every night and reattach before next mission. I know..pain ....

But you want to see the voltage while idling at least... alternator should be delivering around 14v... across battery terminals (ARE YOURS really CLEAN,right?) .. same test points (batt terminals ) as watching the battery.

Usually if you have 12.0v more or less on a cold battery, it will crank your starter (and battery experiences a quick voltage drop to 10 or 11v while cranking.. you'd need a second person to observe that, and you still wouldn't know how many amps your starter is drawing...if under 150-200 amp draw, probably starter is ok)."

1ns9tu1,Light Bar wiring help. Trigger wire confusion.,"Trying to install a small light bar on my son's 2014 Toyota Corolla. I've successfully done this for my Hilux, my motorcycle and my other son's Rav4, this one is killing me. 

The kit came with a ready made harness, including an adapter to plug into the back of the head lamp. The adapter doesn't work because the high beam operates on a mechanical reflector change inside the headlight assembly. I have located the trigger wire with a test lamp and can (with great difficulty) splice into this wire. 

The adapter has both black and red wires leading into the harness. Using a multimeter, I checked resistance across all wires. I would typically use just a single wire from the high beam to run to relay pin 86. I tested this from the black (negative) adapter wire input and it shows zero resistance when the light bar switch is 'on', no reading when 'off'. So far so good. 

My confusion stems from the red (positive) adapter wire input. This is permanently linked to pin 85. Shouldn't this be be grounded? The adapter would have it also connected to the high beam wire. 

Splicing the high beam trigger is going to be a painful exercise so I don't want to proceed until I'm sure. I think it will be OK if I connect the red input wire to ground, the black input wire to the high beam and the other pins as per their respective plugs.

It happened, by chance, just a couple of blocks from the Honda dealer, so took it there for diagnosis.  Technician said one cylinder was misfiring; said that cylinder had watery liquid on the ignition coil and in the spark plug tube.  Also coolant was low, ""radiator wasn't full.""

They suspected the cooling system might be somehow leaking into one cylinder, so did a pressure test, but said no leak was detected.  Said the originally wet coil would still misfire when the engine warmed up, so urged replacing it.  OK, guess so.

The mystery that remains:  how would watery liquid get into one cylinder?  I assume the dealership would have been happy to find a leak in the cooling system if there was one, so probably not that.  If there is no logical explanation, only obscure theory I could think of was:  maybe sabotage by repair shop that handled oil change six months earlier.  Putting water or some more reactive liquid in a cylinder might be an easy and reliable way to bring the customer back soon for a costly repair.

1ns5mqv,2025 Ford Bronco towing module,"Hi everyone,

I am trying to figure out how to get my towing module to work on my bronco. The 2025 Bronco comes with the wiring harness already installed. My understanding is I need the towing module, the 4/7 ping connector and the hitch receiver. I installed the hitch receiver and bought the Ford OEM 4/7 connector as well as the OEM towing module. I installed the towing module which required removing the driver side storage side panel in the back (picture attached for reference).

I plugged my trailer in and the parking lamps work but the brakes, turn signals, and hazards don't work. Any thoughts?

I don't have a crystal-clear direction yet, but I know that's where my passion lies.

The next step is figuring out whether I can realistically take on one of their programs while still holding down my full-time job. I know many of them involve apprenticeships, and I'm curious-has anyone here managed to balance something like that?

I'm not quite ready to quit my current role, so I'd love to hear real-life experiences from anyone who's made a similar leap or juggled work and study successfully. How did you manage your time? What would you do differently? Any insights would mean a lot.

Octane rating - This rating measures the fuel's ability to resist knocking in an engine, with higher numbers indicating greater resistance to premature ignition.

Basically, it doesn't make the fuel burn faster, hotter or make more power... Higher octane ratings prevents ignition prior to when the spark occurs, or pre-ignition (or ""knocking""), which can be devastating to an engine in some cases, and it allows for higher compression ratios, more advanced timing, etc.

Higher octane rating by itself does not increase power, torque, or give any other improvement to the engine unless it was being de-tuned for lower grade fuel. 

In it's most basic form, it actually prevents the gas from igniting as soon without affecting how fast/hot it burns, so it is no surprise it isn't flammable by itself."

1nrsasd,2018 Audi Q5 2.0T Cooling issue,"Hello. 

I'm having a serious issue with the cooling system.

Backstory:
 wife was driving home from work on day and about 5mins from the house she said it started to ""puff smoke"". She then drove it home and then told me. The temp gauge was on red for a little, as a way to cool the engine and to find the source of the leak I put Tap water into it. I found the leak and it was the Y Pipe going from the engine to the Radiator and the heater.I replaced the Y pipe with a Audi Genuine part.

Upon replacing the part, I decided doing a coolant system flush was needed which I did. I drained the water out of the engine from the lower radiator hose and put the bottle of flush into the reservoir and then distilled water until the reservoir was at max and ran it. At first it started bubbling from the reservoir as if was boiling, it then started to pour out the over flow valve from the reservoir, I stopped the engine, waited like 10-15mins for it to cool, topped it off with more distilled water into it, squeezed the upper radiator hose a few times and started the engine again and it was fine. 

Now:
I ran to Walmart to get the required coolant and came back, drained the coolant, opened the reservoir cap and let the system drain. I closed off the lower radiator hose, poured the coolant into the system and topped it off and now to the point where it's reliable, it keeps boiling in the reservoir.

 I'll shut the engine off
Pour coolant into the reservoir
Turn on engine with heat on full blast
Run the engine (it will run completely fine at idle under operating temp, as soon as it's help at 2k RPMs or over past like 4mins it will start to boil in the reservoir)
*Begins to boil*
Shut off engine
Will let sit for 5mins
Unscrew cap and will repeat

There is a crack in the cap of the reservoir from what I noticed (this doesn't have a dipstick or bleeder valve for the radiator)

The gauge is part of a whole computer for the instrument panel and they don't usually fail partially liike that (you'd more likely lose the whole panel), however it will read zero if it's not getting any data and this is one of the variables the car uses to know fuel/air mix, valve timing etc. Without this input, the ECU will likely throw an error code (the check engine light) and is probably why it runs weirdly, as the engine computer doesn't really have any idea what is going on if it doesn't know how fast the engine is spinning. 

I'm not familiar with the layout of Dodges, but there's a chance that the cable to the sensor was damaged or disconnected during the alt service. If it's a well designed vehicle, fixing/replacing the sensor will probably be pretty cheap (unless there's a lot of labour due to annoying design :/ )"

Now today it’s at 198k miles and drives fine. I know a bit about working on cars. However for the life of me I can’t figure out why randomly the lights on this car flicker. 

Sometimes they flicker almost to the point they’re going off and on other times it’s dimming. This includes dash lights, head lights and any inside lights. Almost like the car is losing power but I lose no engine power and power steering is fine.

Now when I google this issue it seems common and no one has an actual fix for it.

I can usually shut the car off and then back on and it’ll stop. It happens randomly though.
3 hours in driving it’ll happen or sometimes first time I turn the car on or after 10 mins.

I had a mechanic look the car over when I first got it and he found a ground point that was disconnected. That’s been fixed. I looked recently and they look cleanish and fine.

Or put more parts on to fix it, probably need control arms to compensate for the lift.

Able-Craft-6449 (Score: 1): you'll need a set of aftermarket upper control arms (UCAs) that provide more adjustment range than your current setup allows, as ball joint spacers and maxed-out stock UCAs are insufficient for a lift of this height. A lift of 3 inches significantly alters the suspension geometry, necessitating upgraded UCAs to restore proper alignment and maintain safety. 
Why You Have a Problem
Altered Suspension Geometry:
A 3-inch lift changes the angle of your suspension components, which puts the upper and lower control arms at an extreme angle. 
Ball Joint Spacer Limitations:
A 2-inch ball joint spacer on a stock UCA can't provide the necessary adjustment range for a 3-inch lift. 
Positive Camber:
This excessive positive camber means the top of your wheels are leaning outward, leading to unsafe driving conditions and poor tire wear. 
How to Correct It
Install Aftermarket UCAs: The most effective solution is to replace your current bolt-in UCAs with aftermarket UCAs specifically designed for lifted vehicles. These UCAs have a different design that allows for greater adjustment of camber and other alignment angles.
Achieve Proper Alignment:
Once the new UCAs are installed, a professional alignment will be required to correctly adjust the camber, caster, and toe settings.
The new UCAs will provide the necessary adjustment range for the technician to set your alignment to factory specifications. 
Important Considerations
Safety:
Driving with an incorrect alignment due to a lifted suspension can be unsafe, so it's crucial to address the alignment properly. 
Ride Quality:
Upgrading the UCAs will also improve the performance and ride quality of your lifted Tahoe. 
Professional Alignment:
Always have a qualified alignment technician perform the final alignment after installing new suspension components."

I plan to keep this truck for a long time so I swapped out the exhaust manifolds for the BD diesel ones and they have been fantastic thus far. I said that to say I am very confident that the noise I am hearing is not an exhaust leak.

Seems to be getting worse so I took it too the dealer and they had the truck for 3 days only for them to of course, you guessed it, say they can't duplicate the noise and that everything is operating as designed. 

Yes the truck seems to be operating as designed, however that noise does not seem normal. My dad has the same truck and his does not make this noise nor do the other Ram trucks I've listed too.

I have seen several videos on YouTube with this same exact noise and you've guessed it again, no one has mentioned a fix.

Does anyone know what this noise could be and or a fix?

1nrgyp4,Does this sound like a healthy engine ?,"

Hello all,

Car is a 2009 Ford Escape 3.0 V6 AWD with about 248000 miles. Father in law gave it to us for free after taking very good care of if for 15 years, although he states that by the end it cost too much to keep fixing everything so the brief for his mechanic was ""do the minimum to keep it running and nothing more."" It always had regular oil changes.

Since I received it, I did a full tune up with new plugs and coils, new PCV, new canister purge valve, cleaned the throttle body and EGR, new oil and filters, transmission flush and ran some concentrated injector cleaner through the fuel system. That fixed the codes and driveability issues (was misfiring a lot and sounded like the worst diesel), all I can notice now  is a slightly worn engine mount and very slight rpm drops when letting go of gas when revving or turning the steering wheel.


 I don't really know where to take it from here. The car drives fine and vibration level is about what you'd  expect from such a high mileage car. My main question is, is it worth putting some more money into the car to fix everything ? It would need a full suspension overhaul and all the engine gaskets/manifolds done to stop some oil and exhaust leaks. I priced all of that on Rockauto for about $800, which I could afford and do myself if it meant the car was reliable and trustworthy again.

Video shows cold start, shifting through gears, some 2k rpm revs on neutral then some revs in drive with foot on the brake.

Apart from swapping the transmission or engine, I feel like I could keep fixing all the smaller things that end up breaking, there is tons of videos on working on the car and I'm quite handy around it at this point.

Here would be my questions: 

- Does the engine sound normal for a 3.0 Duratec ?
- Does it need new engine and trans mounts ?
- How much more can this engine give if I keep changing the oil every 4k miles ? Granted I spend $800-1000 to fix everything it needs, can I trust it to drive very long distances (thinking on going on a road trip) ? 

My wife also drives the car so reliability is very important to me. In law says it would be a waste to pour money into it and have it fail in a couple thousand miles but I feel like the engine and trans are heathy enough to try.

1ns3oko,GT86 vs F22 M240i (Mental Supra and M2 fans need not comment),"Hi all. Just need some input from prior owners on these two cars. My intention is to daily them (I work fully remote so usage will be low). Wanted a coupe and sportier car since I'm a petrol-head and struggle to really pick between these two. Right now, a good example of either car seems to be anywhere between £18K - £20K, they're both generally reliable and both generally eat fuel at the same rate, so it more comes down to fun vs comfort.

I understand many say the GT86 is one of the most fun and best handling cars, though the torque dip does seem to be a real issue, even just if overtaking, and the general ride, cabin noise and interior make it fairly unpleasant on longer journeys. Though it is at least also a rare and more interesting car.

By comparison the F22 M240i is apparently much faster, much more comfortable, has usable back seats should you need them, but apparently from what I've been reading has awful handling and totally dead steering. It is also just another 2-series BMW on the road.

Trying to parse fans, remorseful buyers, badge-shaggers ( I sware some of you take commission trying to push sales of M2s/Supras) and dramatic takes has been extremely hard, and really hoping for some concise insight if I can get some.

Bonus question: I've seen *a lot* of people say that an M2x0i is a nonce's car/chav car. I have no idea where this comes from. Is there a regional association I'm not aware of or is this just more insane badge-shaggery from ""real"" M-cars fans?",1,1759000503.0,21,CartalkUK,1759087932,2025-09-27 19:15:03,2025-09-28 19:32:12,"InViewOfNothing (Score: 5): GT86 is an excellent car ruined by the arthritic Subaru boxer it was saddled with.

VehiclePlastic1882 (Score: 2): Understanding your use case would be handy.

The GT86 has the most direct steering feel of any car I’ve driven. It’s lacking power and therefore you have to drive it very intentionally and ‘consciously.’ Otherwise you will permanently be in the wrong gear and crawling around. It’s also so lightweight that it feels ‘tinny’ compared to most of its contemporaries.

I haven’t had a go in a 240i, although I’ve been in powerful 1’s and 3’s. If they are representative it’s a more grown-up but distant feeling car.

For twisty country roads with low top speeds but prioritising driver involvement I’d take a GT86.

For longer drives to see family in far flung bits of the country, the Beemer.

For track use I’d choose a turbo/super GT86.

Psychological_Post28 (Score: 2): I owned a M240i for 3.5 years. Most of that time it was running approx 460hp. It was flawlessly reliable. I changed the shocks and springs for aftermarket and added a Mperformance LSD which were a huge improvement.

But handling was still pretty poor. Accelerating hard in lower gears felt like launching a speedboat the rear floats around so much. No issues with traction, it’s the bushes and suspension squishing about. Steering is numb and the whole experience can be summed up as “floaty”. Not a patch on the FK8 Civic Type R I owned before in this regard. The engine is a masterpiece though and you’ll not find much in the road that’s so insanely fast, particularly for the cost."

I was told that any faults could be addressed under warranty by my local dealer, unfortunately an Arnold Clark.

The car was making this weird squeak sound when coming off/on the power. My local dealer had the car in to check it out. They took apart and reassembled the rear brakes and told me it was fine. The squeak was still there, and I have now realised that this is caused by the exhaust valve opening and closing.

Unfortunately, ever since they messed with the brakes they have started squeaking at low speeds, and are now slightly binding when first setting off and after firm application of the brakes. The car went in for a diff service, and I asked them to investigate this at the same time.

I was told that they would have to charge me to remedy the problem they caused because the brakes aren't covered under warranty. I asked how much it would be, and they told me 'dunno we'd have to look at it'. Needless to say they didn't, and they didn't quote me a price either. They did give me a nice leaflet explaining how shit M Sport brakes are though.

So now I have a car with two small annoying issues. It's been to the dealer about 5 times now for this. Quite why they think they now have to charge me for the brakes, when they did this work without me asking previously for free and caused the problem, I don't know.

1nrzgab,Bought a used car and finding hidden paint issues. Am I overreacting?,"On 19 September I collected a used (low mileage) 2024 Tesla Model Y from a well rated online dealership. Their model is that you can’t see or test-drive the car before pickup, but they advertise a 7-day return policy.

A few days later I noticed:
	
- A couple of small scratches (dent) on the back bumper (could have been there at pickup or during a quick stop at a service station)
-A sticky, foul-smelling substance on the passenger seat.

Neither issue was visible in the listing photos (an 360 view). I contacted their rep and they offered me a £100 discount. Since I liked the car and had already sold my old one, I accepted.

Now that I’ve looked more closely, I’ve found worrying paintwork, clearly done at their workshop. 

The worst bit is where they painted over Tesla’s protective film (the small plastic strip that protects the paint from stone chips).

The 7-day return window has passed, but I’m still within the UK’s 14-day cooling-off period for distance purchases.

I’m frustrated and worried the poor paint job could lead to future problems and expensive repairs, specially around the protective film. I’m also concerned there may be other, more serious issues that I just haven’t discovered yet.

I've had it for 7 years from 67k and I absolutely love it, well for the fourth time in 2 years my car was broken into, despite not being locked and having nothing inside of it, not even a fancy radio. I've previously lost the blue tinted glass on the rear and front passenger side, now I've lost the drivers side too. I've never been able to replace it with blue but instead green, so atleast it'll all match again.

It's had thousands spent underneath.

Anything I’m missing or have I found a bit of a loophole?",0,1758961172.0,1,CartalkUK,1759087932,2025-09-27 08:19:32,2025-09-28 19:32:12,"Ancient_Farmer7543 (Score: 1): I wouldn't touch anything from Marshall's.

1nrp7s2,Sold a car from salvage auction,"So, bit of a long winded one this but I need some help. Nearly 3 years ago I financed a BMW 440i m sport from a “friend” who sourced me the car from his dealership. He told me the car had some front end damage that had been repaired. Long story short the car was sold at salvage auction on 27/07/2022. He never disclosed this nor was I shown the damage. He said any issues he would take car of, as when I received the car from the dealership there was a fair amount of warning lights on it. Long story short again he had the car back many times always coming up with a new excuse as to why he couldn’t sort, massive time waster.

So I recently ran an in-depth HPI check to fund out the salvage history and the photos etc. I have been mis- sold this car 100% and wasn’t given the full facts and never in my right mind would I finance a car that had serious damage ( trust me it is not minor damage it was bad the whole front end was off) I’m amazed the dealership sourced me this car without disclosing any of this to me the only thing i was told by him was that it had front end damage but was “professionally” sorted.

Now, nearly 3 years on I want rid and to my horror find out all of this now. I feel as though I am stuck with this car as I am paying the car finance still, I have listed it for sale and have been very transparent but obviously the history quickly deters potential buyers. I have e-mailed the finance company with a little help from chat-gbt basically saying I’m in my rights here and was mis sold etc. How could they be ok with this car been financed with the issues it has. I just want to know if anyone knows what my rights are what you would do etc ??

LudaMusser (Score: 4): You were told that the car was damaged repaired before you bought it. Not sure how you have been mis-sold anything. I could understand it if you hadn’t been told but you were. The fact that it’s from a salvage auction isn’t relevant"
1nrorg1,First Car Recs?,"I just passed my test and looking to buy but I’m overwhelmed - I’ve been on auto trader for days but I don’t really know what I’m looking for and every time I think I find a good car I see a bunch of reviews saying it’s shit and has lots of issues (Citroen C3, Peugeot 208, Ford Fiesta etc etc) 

I have a budget of £5K - £6K

Your budget is good but you’ll have high insurance as a new driver anyway. Citroens, Peugeots etc are cheap and plentiful on the market but they are not reliable. Reliability is really with Japanese cars like Toyotas and Hondas (not Nissan which are full of Renault parts). If also buy outright if you can as otherwise you’re tied to the brand or finance company and you also own the thing outright so if you treat it like crap that’s up to you.

queefmcbain (Score: 1): First car, get a Citroen C1/ Peugeot 107/ Toyota Aygo.

You'll get a good one for £2k or less, they're very simple and cheap mechanically to repair for you to either take to a garage, a mate, or to have a go yourself.

My missus has had one for 8 years and we've been all over the country in it. Great around town, but we've done airport runs, a Welsh coast to coast and been all the way to Scotland and Ireland in it.

In 12 months time, see if you want to switch it up and try something else and you'll have saved more money for something else."
1nrkh2r,Winter tyres in Scotland question,"Hi there, I’m wondering if you good people could help me with something. In March of this year my girlfriend and I bought an almost new BMW 118i (74 reg). It had about 7k on the clock at purchase and due to my girlfriend’s commute & my occasional Glasgow to Somerset and back trips home, it’s now approaching its first service at 18k. It’s currently wearing Continental SportContact 6s which I believe it’s had from new. Whilst they don’t appear to have suffered the tread wear the internet would have me believe, I am concerned that they aren’t a good winter tyre, especially in a Glaswegian winter. If anyone could advise on whether or not the switch to a winter or all weather tyre would make a tangible difference safety wise, I would be much obliged. Current dimensions are 235/35 R19(I know) Thanks!

Add to that the variable winter temps we can get, one day it might be cold enough to justify winter tyres, the next it's freakishly warm for the middle of winter.

All seasons carrying the 3PMSF are probably going to be the least amount of hassle, and given the variable weather we often experience, all seasons are probably the best suited to our climate.

How well you'll cope really depends on the local geography though. Contrary to Reddit belief, you're not going to spontaneously skate everywhere and hit 47 trees just because you've got summer tyres on. But all seasons will provide at least some level of improvement in the winter over summers. Winters even more so, but that then comes with extra hassle and expense of having two sets of tyres.

Delicious_Ad_6787 (Score: 21): I would recommend Michelin Crossclimate 3 tyre, it's winter rated and can be used also in summer. It's an outstanding product made to a very high quality. 

Very safe choice when weather gets colder and ice and snow on the road.

No need, winters in Glasgow are in the whole mild and wet, most people .....(99% of people) dont change to winter tyres in the central belt of Scotland, up north towards the Highlands maybe but you're going to be fine staying on a decent summer tyre in the central belt."
