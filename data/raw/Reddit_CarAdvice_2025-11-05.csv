1oon7el,2021 Toyota Venza — gas pump keeps auto-shutting off when fueling (possible EVAP canister issue?),"Hey all,  
Looking for some advice or confirmation before I take this into the shop.

Lately, every time I try to fill up my 2021 Toyota Venza, the gas pump keeps clicking off after only 2–3 seconds of fueling. I have to hold the handle manually and let the gas drain into the tank super slowly to keep it from shutting off. What used to be a quick 3-minute fill-up now takes 15–20 minutes.

This problem seemed to start right after my **gas cap cover wouldn’t open** — even when I pressed the button inside the car (the one near the driver’s side wheel). I had to **manually open it from inside the panel**. The next day, it started opening normally again with the button, but the fueling issue began again immediately afterward.

From what I’ve been reading, it *might* be a problem with the **EVAP canister or vent valve** not letting air escape while fueling, but I’m not 100% sure. **There is a check engine light on the dash**, and the car otherwise drives totally fine.

Has anyone else with a newer Venza (or similar Toyota hybrid) had this issue? Did it turn out to be the EVAP system or something else like a kinked vent hose?

If you did have this problem, how much did it cost to repair or replace the part(s)?

I also turned ever so slightly to make a turn at stoplight going about 30 and I heard a lot of binding and grinding noises.

The vapors after fueling up flood your intake since the purge valve is bad and stuck open, it’s suppose to be closed when the car is off. MAP can’t react to all the extra pressure and ECU can’t compensate fast enough and you’ll have a rich condition and car will either stall or be sluggish to start. Goes away after letting car sit and as the vapors start to dissipate. Next time you fuel up , just go into the engine bay and unplug the purge valve canister connector. It will literally tell the ECU hey we’re not using this part anymore and it will force it shut and you’ll usually be able to start the car right away not need to wait.

The vibration was so intense that I didn't want to brake anymore. I consulted my mechanic, and we had the brake discs replaced. 1,000 km later, the same vibration was incredibly annoying. Another repair, another disc replacement, and this time, the pads were changed again. Another 1,000 km drive, and I still have the same vibration. What could be causing this? What are we doing wrong?

DTV is caused by lateral runout, caused by not cleaning rust off the hub, not using a torque wrench to tighten lug nuts or a worn wheel bearing. Anything that prevents the rotor from running perfectly parallel with the steering knuckle will cause the rotor to spin in a slight wobble. After 2-3,000 miles of running like this, the rotor accumulates pad buildup on opposite sides of the rotor. Or, if you're using semi-metallic pads, they wear opposite sides of the rotor. Then you get pedal pulsation.

1oojlyf,Help diagnosing my Ford 1995 mustang GT 5.0L,"So i have a 1995 mustang 5.0L HO that i’ve been chasing a problem that i keep thinking i fix. the car will start and run and drive no problem. However I turned it off to get gas and it won’t restart. it will crank with out ignition. i had it towed to a shop after unsuccessfully trying to fix the problem my self. In the past i thought the issue was resolved after replacing the following things.
Mass air flow sensors, intake O2 sensor, Idle control valve, and ignition module (also called TFI module in Fox body 5.0L). other things that are new are all the vacuume lines and collant lines. The shop called me before they started to go crazy. they were able to start it fine and drive it into the garage but after that they witness the issue i’ve been having. There mechanic thinks the ECU is going bad because the OBD1 sensors was through it automatic transmission codes despite it being a manual. they told me it would be 130/hr to take a volt meter to each sensor. so i decided to drive it home and do that part for free. Whatever is happening I think it’s ignition based. i’ve heard that if the PIP sensor or throttle position sensor then it will cause this. does anyone have any suggestions? 

edit* technition notes. Engine cranks perfectly fine and starts. Drove the vehicle into the shop and let it run while we checked fluid levels and basic inspection. Shut the engine off and restarted. Engine ran for a second and died. Engine cranks, restarts and dies and check engine light is on now. Installed a fuel gauge to check fuel pressure. Found fuel pressure is 38 KOER. Fuel pressure specification is 35-45. The engine will only stay running if the RPM is held up. The vehicle runs perfect until you shut the engine off and try to restart it. Then the engine does not want to start when it does start it won't idle it just dies. When vehicle does not start the fuel pressure is good, The ignition system is firing a good spark to the plugs and the injectors are getting signal. The vehicle appears to be dumping fuel upon cranking. The vehicle will start and run as long as you continue to open the throttle. All the sensors remain within good specifications. Will need to remove the PCM and perform pin out testing on each and every sensor input and output at the PCM

i called the tech he thinks there some problem with the fuel. the fuel pump is working, there the correct pressure at the rails and the injectors are getting good current.

I’ve been slowly fixing things myself and learning as I go, but I'm stuck now and could really use some guidance.

**What I’ve done so far:**

* Fixed a **coolant flange leak**
* Had a bunch of electrical codes → **replaced battery**, most disappeared
* Still had **P2196 (B1S1 stuck rich)** and **P1114 (B1S2)**
* Checked for **vacuum leaks**, ran **fuel system cleaner**, **cleaned MAF** and **throttle body**
* Replaced **upstream O2** → P2196 went away
* Replaced **downstream O2** → cleared P1114

**Now new codes showed up:**

* **P0456** – Very small EVAP leak
* **P0429 & P0430** – Catalyst efficiency below threshold (both banks)

So instead of getting better, I’ve now got **3 new codes** and I’m not sure what direction to go in.

**Other issues I’ve noticed:**

* Slight **valve cover leak**
* One spark plug well had **oil pooled in it** (plug was drenched)

**I’m still new to working on cars**, so I’m trying to understand the cause rather than just throwing parts at it. My main question is:

**What should I be diagnosing next?**  
Could the valve cover leak + oil in plug well cause these codes?  
Or is my **catalytic converter actually done**, or is this possibly related to the EVAP leak?

1oodvcl,2002 jeep grand cherokee leaking fluid?,"this car has so many issues, 224,500k miles. it’s my dads car that i recently had to take over the title on so we’d have a car, knowing it had issues but not having a choice unless i wanted us carless. the main issue is suspension issues, that sometimes cause the car and wheel to shake uncontrollably especially when breaking going down a hill. it’s up for inspection in December so while i was passing my mechanics place, i decided to stop and ask how much it’d be to have him go over the car and tell me everything it’ll need to pass inspection. but while i was waiting, i was looking out the window at my car and saw it dripping a lot of fluid (to my knowledge it started dripping when i parked) he took a quick peek under the hood and said it was coolant and i likely needed a new water pump.

i was on my way to a friends house when this happened, so i stopped there for a little to see what happened with the car. when i parked there no fluid continued to leak, so i checked the reservoir to see if it was empty and it was still half full, just like it was at my mechanic’s when he looked. later that night i drove home and checked it and no more coolant has leaked. and im pretty sure this is a new thing, because my dads very car savvy and if there was fluid leaking all over the driveway he would have seen it. 

so i’m just confused as to why it seemly only happened once (so far)? do i have to worry about it, like is there any chance it was a fluke? it definitely was coolant tho, because when i looked under the car to see if it has leaked, the front inner left  
wheel had that sticky coolant residue from when it had leaked, so it wasn’t water.

If only on the ground, it may be from the person  parked there before you. 

Sometimes coolant will leak only under certain scenarios. Go ahead and get a gallon or two and keep it in your car so you don't get stranded. Remember that if it overheats, you need to pull over and turn engine off. Irreversible damage will occur if you don't. 

If this happens again, open hood and take pictures of anything that is wet and post it in the comments. It will help get you the right answer.

1oodlvq,"07 Honda Accord, 2.4L 4cyl - Acts like battery is dead/weak even though it's brand new. Won't start.","After being stranded on a street when it wouldn't start... I went over to help my son out.

Tried jumping it, it didn't seem to be ""taking"" a charge at all.  I figured the battery was shot.  I picked up a new one.

After putting the new battery in, it STILL was acting like the battery was super weak.

The starter would run, turn the car weakly over once or twice... then just sort of go silent.

We eventually got lucky after charging it from the jumper cables for a while and it started.

I drove it home and put it on the charger in my garage.

After charging at 2amps overnight (about 14hrs total) I tried it again.  Same thing.  Just acting like it was dead/weak battery.

I figured maybe there was some parasitic drain... so I pulled the battery out and charged it while sitting on the floor of the garage.  

I put it back in this morning and it's the same thing.

It turns over weakly once or twice and then just quits.

So, it's not a matter of the starter turning everything over and the car just not starting... it's a matter of the (presumably) fully charged battery just not having enough ""oomph"" to turn the starter and the car.

The car is currently stuck in my garage (underground) and I'm desperately hoping to get it started ONE MORE TIME to get it to a shop.

Roughly 800 miles on the current oil. Sent the oil off to be analyzed. Lab numbers appear to be ok. Talk with a lab tech and get confirmation. It  also appears the incorrect oil and amount was used. Car calls for 5w-50, viscosity does not match. Also calls for 10 qts. It had 8 in it. I topped it up with 2 qts of the correct oil. The three latter codes (15,17,19) vanished after a a couple cycles.

Motor runs healthy 90% of the time. Occasional rough idle, usually snaps out of it after rpm change. 

What are the next steps I could take to diagnose these issues without spending thousands of unnecessary dollars.

I have been, as a dad who works on his own cars excepting the fuel systems, asked to replace the fuel injectors on a 2018 Kia Soul with a 1.6L GDI engine for a friend of one of my kids. He supplied the new injectors that he bought from GB remanufacturing. Apparently they are not returnable at all. 

The injectors are overall the same length but the metal body of the new injectors is longer than the old injector body. There is a removable metal depth stop clip on the old injectors which keep them from being sunk too far into the rail. The longer metal body of the new ones will not allow the injector to seat into the rail as deeply as the old ones. The bottom part of o-rings on the new injectors is even with the rail instead of being deep in. 

If I install them as is, the fuel rail will sit proud of the head and the intake manifold will not go back on correctly because the rail will be sticking out too far. 

I would order new injectors if it was my car (not knowing enough to know if these are still fine) but he says he doesn’t have another $500 to spend on them and GB won’t take these back. 

Fine as they are because the o-ring seal is all that is keeping the fuel from spraying between the injector and rail and it is in the rail although not as deeply? Bend the clips? Leave the clips off and hope the injectors don’t seat too deeply? 

I don’t want fuel to leak out onto a hot engine and catch this car on fire. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

1oo5zhk,Coolant temperature gauge dropping while driving faster on my Audi A4 B5 1.8T (1999) – can’t find the cause,"Hi,

I own an Audi A4 B5 1.8T APU from 1999. For over a year I’ve been struggling with an issue with the coolant temperature gauge on the dashboard. The first symptoms were that while driving on the highway, the gauge would correctly show 90°C, but then suddenly drop to 60°C in an instant, as if it had stopped reading the correct temperature. After a while, the needle would go back to 90°C again.

I replaced the thermostat — that didn’t help. Then I replaced the coolant temperature sensor with a brand new original one (the previous one was also original). The only change was that before, the gauge would rise quickly to 90°C, but after replacing the sensor, it rose very slowly. Previously, after driving about 5 km, the needle would go straight to 90°C, but after the replacement, it stayed around 60°C. Only after parking the car and turning off the engine — when the coolant circulation stopped — the needle would show 90°C after about 5 While driving around town at about 50 km/h, the gauge stayed at 90°C. However, when driving faster (around 90–120 km/h), the needle gradually dropped to about 65–70°C — as if the airflow at higher speeds was cooling down the coolant too much. The engine oil temperature stayed normal and didn’t drop with the coolant temperature.

I assumed the coolant temperature sensor was faulty and replaced it again. After installing another new sensor, everything seemed fine — the gauge quickly rose to 90°C and didn’t drop at higher speeds. However, I noticed that during warm-up, the needle would slow down around 80°C and take a long time to reach 90°C.

I tested the thermostat by putting it in boiling water and measuring the temperature — it closes properly at around 83°C and opens below that, so it doesn’t seem to be the issue. I took a two-minute video  driving 100-140km/h where you can see the gauge dropping before your eyes.

Any help will be appreciated

1oo2ilb,Blown Serpentine Belt Hissing,"A bit of background. I purchased an 06 Honda Element with a power steering leak. From said PS leak I found that the serpentine belt was fraying and needed replacement. I messed up and drove it before I could fix the belt or leak. While driving, the serpentine belt blew and I lost PS and the car started to overheat, I pulled over and shut it off before it redlined. I opened the hood and the coolant was boiling/spitting all over from overflow reservoir and the belt was wound up throughout the various pulleys. I got the car towed to my house and bought a new belt to replace the old one ripped/wound up one. 

** Here’s where id like some thoughts/opinions.** I open the hood with new belt ready to replace it(it’s been just about 2 hours since the belt blew while driving), and I can hear a very faint hissing sound coming from the area. In the engine bay everything is clumped on the passenger side, so I couldn’t detect exactly where it was coming from whether it was from a line/hose or a unit(ps pump, water pump, radiator, etc. they are all very close proximity to each other and each others lines.) 

It took me about 1 hour to change the belt and the slight hissing noise stayed the whole time(3 hours of hissing since initial belt blow/overheat). After the new belt was installed, I checked the radiator and opened the pressure cap and it didn’t have pressure built up(hissing still persisting), and there was coolant filled to the top still, but the overflow reservoir was low. After changing the belt and checking coolant level, I test drove for a solid 45 minutes to make sure all was correct. The car did not overheat and the ac was still cold. I turned the ac on and off several times and it would blow cold air, but I didn’t run it the whole 45 minutes for fear of leaking the refrigerant(thinking the hissing may be ac leak). When I got back home after my test drive the hissing was gone. I checked the AC  low pressure line and the it read at around 24-26 psi with ac on full blast and blowing consistent 50 degree cold air from the vents. Since the car was hot, I did not check radiator until it cooled off several hours later, and when I did the radiator level had dropped and needed to be topped off about 1/4 a gallon and another 1/4 into the reservoir. Hissing noise still gone. 

Any ideas on what the hissing could have been after the car had cooled off for 3 hours after initial overheat? 

I’m nervous I have some underlying damaged components or leaks that I created when the belt blew off and got wound up.

When a car overheats, that pressure shoots way up over 15 PSI, but the system is designed to slowly release it like a regulator, otherwise all of your coolant would immediately shoot out (that's why you never open a coolant system while it's hot).


You can safely recreate that scenario using a coolant pressure test kit to pressurize the system & hunt down where the hissing is coming from. There are cheaper & more expensive kits, but here's an example:

It was a pure metal on metal sound and the car was reving high by itself, I feel like the reving is a vacuum hose or a sensor not put back correctly but I’m not sure what the grinding could be. I did also get a new clutch put in recently for some context. 

I added an example of what it sounds like, it’s not my car but it’s the sound I hear and obviously my car isn’t moving it’s just in neutral.

2018 LS 500 - ABS system light,  VSC off, all ADAS systems disabled.

I was juat crusing along the highway and suddenly the ABS, VSC and all the ADAS lights came on at once. Brakes themselves work flawlessly, no change in driving experience.

Local garage was unable to even connect to abs module from OBD. They suggested taking it to specialists in electronic diagnosis. Wanted to know if anyone has seen something like this before. Another interesting thing to note is, I took the wheels off to see if any of the wheel sensors were clipped, i noticed the fromt pads were done, so i put new ones on. And to my surprise the lights went away, but they returned after two days of normal driving which really stumped me. Bevause until that point i was hoping it was just a blown fuse.

1oohjs5,Fascinated by how resilient cars apparently are.,"
Don't know if this is the place but I just want to share that fascination. Also, English is not my first language so I might get words wrong.

I recently bought my first car, at 41, because I needed it for work. The car is 21 years old with a fairly high mileage.

Quite soon, I found that one of the brake calipers was stuck. Terrible noise. Took a while before I could fix it. Didn't stop the car from running just fine, but fixing it felt great afterwards.

Then found that it had some oil leak. The crankcase ventilation was completely clogged with oil residue and pressure was building up in a way it really shouldn't. The car? Still running just fine. Fixed it, of course, and changed the cylinder head gasket as well, but the car wasn't very bothered.

Then found that emission values were off, and we suspected the spark plugs. When changing them, we found that they were not only old and worn out - three of them were bathing in oil from some previous leaking, dark, burnt and ugly. And the car? Well, maybe it was a little tricky when starting at a traffic light uphill, but no big deal, really.

So, this old car was somehow running just fine with worn out spark plugs bathing in oil, blocked crankhouse ventilation and a stuck brake caliper. Kind of makes me wonder what it would take for it to actually complain.",46,1762286316.0,41,CarTalk,1762371396,2025-11-04 19:58:36,2025-11-05 19:36:36,"Toll_House69 (Score: 42): Ya it’s pretty cool how reliable they really are.

I live in the Netherlands and I am choosing between two paths. I can finance a nicer EV like a Tesla Model 3 or a Polestar 2. Or I can pay cash for a simple, reliable car. I like comfort, but I do not want to waste money. I am also open to a hybrid.

I drive about 600 to 700 km per month. My cash budget is under €15000. If I finance, I can handle €350 to €400 per month. My take home pay is €2600 now. It might go up by as much as 30% very soon but I am not sure yet. I have €17000 in savings and €11000 in investments. I am 24 years old, licensed for 6 years, no claims or tickets. I have no years of registered insurance in the Netherlands yet. I have parking for €90 per year.

I worry about EV depreciation and changing taxes or incentives. I also cannot import a car from outside the Netherlands because the registration cost makes it too expensive. Roads here are good, so a small car may be enough for me.

What would you do in my place? Should I finance an EV, buy a used hybrid, or pay cash for a simple petrol car? If you can share real total cost of ownership numbers in the Netherlands, that would help a lot. Model suggestions that fit my budget are also welcome. Thank you.

Constant-Arm5379 (Score: 2): Keep in mind that when financing, they register your financing at the BKR (credit agency for the non-Dutch). When you want to take out a mortgage for example, the bank looks at how much you borrowed (not how much is left to pay), multiplies that by 5, and subtracts it from how much you can borrow for a house.

Paying back a car loan takes time my friend. For how many years do you want to finance? If you choose 5 years, a 30k loan ends up becoming €500/month hassle. And you’re paying this on a car that depreciates like crazy. By the time you’re paid up you’ll be almost 30.

Imagine you borrow 30k for your car. You pay off some of it over the years. Let’s say you paid off half of it (15k). Now you go to the bank for a mortgage, and they say that you can borrow 300k. But, you still have that 30k financing on your name. That 30k becomes 150k. They subtract that from the 300k mortgage you can get. Congrats, you can now only get 150k from the bank for a house, unless you pay off the entire loan you took for your car (so you’d need to sell it). Second hand market for EVs is pretty terrible, so selling it is going to be a bit of a hassle. Plus, EVs lose value insanely quickly (at least in The Netherlands).

And keep in mind, even if you paid off 80% of your car’s financing back, the bank still only looks at the 30k, and don’t care about how much you paid off. So they still keep multiplying the 30k by 5 and subtract it from your possible mortgage."

1onw1gw,Need advice – P0016 & P0017 codes on my ‘09 Chevy Malibu 2.4L,"Hey Everyone,

Looking for some help and advice here. I’ve got a 2009 Chevy Malibu with the 2.4L engine 121k miles. Recently, two codes popped up — **P0016** and **P0017**. Over the weekend, I replaced both camshaft position sensors myself. That actually cleared the **P0016**, but **P0017** is still showing.

I reached out to my mechanic, and he referred me to one of his buddies who said it’s most likely the **timing chain** — apparently a common issue on these engines. He also mentioned that Chevy's are known for burning oil faster. He quoted me between **$1,800 and $2,000** for the timing chain job.

My oil life percentage has dropped to **74%**, and I just had an oil change last month. The shop used **conventional oil** (not synthetic), and I’ve been doing mostly city driving, so I get why it’s burning a bit faster than normal.

My main question:

* Is that repair price reasonable or too high?
* Given the age and condition of my car (not worth a ton and it’s been in a previous accident), is it even worth fixing?
* I can’t really afford a new car right now, but I also don’t want to dump money into something that’s going to die shortly after.

Has anyone else dealt with this before? Would you recommend doing the timing chain, or cutting my losses and trying to find a cheap replacement car instead?

Any advice, experience, or perspective would be super appreciated. I’m just trying to make the smartest move here.

In this clip I was at one of my stops waiting to turn so it can be heard whilst accelerating. As you can hear it gets louder as rpms go up, it drives smoothly no hiccups during driving or acceleration and when I let off the gas it dies down to near silence (but can still be heard)

A independent shop should be able to get this fixed for about 7k (with a used engine), the dealer will put a new engine in it to the tune of 15k.


Depending on what warranty Nissan has for these cars (I want to say it's 5 years 60k on the powertrain, but I might be wrong), and if you did EVERY oil change on time, it might fall under warranty.


Looked it up, if your car was purchased after this time in 2020, you haven't missed any oil changes (and you have proof), and it has less than 60k miles, itll be a warranty job.


The dealer will ask you to agree to pay the diag fee, if they determine that it falls under warranty, you won't have to pay it. If they don't, you'll be on the hook for it."

1onus9i,What direction are the arrows?,"2006 C280 4Matic  
  
When I was testing the secondary air change-over solenoid, I removed the vacuum hoses and the ***small blue one way check valves***. Stupid me, I did not look or take a picture of the original configuration before pulling things out.  
  
Now, I can't find a picture, illustration or video online to reference the proper sequence ( direction of check valve arrows). Moreover, the two top AI services each had conflicting answers. One said both arrows ( on those small blue one-way valves) point towards the engine manifold and the other said both point towards the solenoid.  
  
  
I know for sure that one vacuum hose is attached to the fat solenoid hose connector, then travels straight down to the passenger side EGR. That same hose branches off and also connects to the drivers side EGR.  
  
The thinner hose connector on the switch over solenoid is attached to a Y shaped black hose section. At that point it branches out to two different hoses. One connects to the front of the manifold and the other extends behind the secondary air pump, under the ECU and goes somewhere behind the engine or manifold on the drivers side.  
  
**QUESTION IS**  
  
**Do both of the arrows on those small blue one way check valves point to the manifold or the solenoid.**  
  
**Or, does one check valve arrow point in one direction and the other point in a different direction**. If so, what direction for the hose that goes into the front of the manifold and what direction for the hose that travels to the back of the engine?

This is an image I took of the underside of my mother's Ford Edge 2013. We took it in in June to have the front axel worked on, and since it has had difficulty holding coolant. The problem is, it isn't leaking at all we can tell. No dipping evidence on the engine or parts we can see, no spots under the car, no smells. Hoses don't have the right pressure, very squishy, and it IS draining somehow. Twice she has had panic attacks because the ""engine overheating"" signal came on and we found the coolant tank bone dry.

D-Laz (Score: 2): Jack it up put it in neutral and try to spin the wheels. They should all spin freely. If one is binding you will hear a rubbing noise. That will be the wheel that the brakes might be seized. 

While your at it you can test the suspension by trying to shake the tire vertically(ball joints/wheel bearings), horizontally (tie rods), then in and out (I forget).

This can save you time and money if something is wrong, you won't break more things driving around on bad parts.

Such-Teacher2121 (Score: 2): Did he make sure the e-brake was 100% disengaged? The pedal brakes sometimes can be slightly depressed withiut any lights on the dash. 

If the car didnt move far, then all he did was verify the parking brake was in good working order. 

There is a chance, if the e-brake uses the regular pads, that it has a stuck caliper, but that issue would have already been there, it just showed up because the e-brake would be the most forceful braking application used. It would have been stuck whether he hit the gas or not.  On a 2010 anything I would expect stuck calipers at some point, they usually make it about 150-180k miles, depending on climate/region. 

If he drove for a significant amount of time with the parking brake on, it may warp the rotors from heat. Even then 100% not a safety issue on its own. A few mins down the road to realize it, is no problem. And something I'd be willing to bet 80% of drivers have done before. Usually wondering why they arent accelerating like normal. 

With a warped rotor, you would definitely notice. Just uncomfortable while braking hard it will shake, and wear the brake pads quicker. You can likely just wait until they are worn to swap pads and rotors."

The automotive industry sucks. The system is broken. There's a reason theres a technician shortage, The poor environment takes its toll, its one of the lowest paying trades there is and the shop politics, and competition surrounding flat rate is just bullshit, as corporations continue to be greedy and pay less and less on labor times. Warranty work pays less and less but you end up doing more of it than anything. You get treated like trash no matter what company you work for.

I do a little bit of all of that at my new maintenance job, but those are fields that are overall just way better than automotive, and it's easier that way to make money, build a career and a skill-set.

1onxmza,Looking for info on CAN sniffing on a Golf 6 using Pi 5,"I have a Golf Mk6 GTi (Australian). I am attempting to replace my head unit with a Pi. Initially, I thought this would be impossible as the car would go haywire without a head unit. The auto parts store told me my AC wouldn't work without a special CAN bus adapter, etc, etc. After pulling the damn thing out and running the car, I can confirm that was a load of bull. Everything works great, the car just throws a silent code for no communication over CAN to the head unit which is obviously to be expected.

Does anyone have experience with these Golfs? I want to be able to get steering wheel controls from a Pi 5. I see that there is an easily accessible CAN high/low in the head unit harness I can easily pull from since the head unit will not be plugged into it. Recommendations on a HAT or similar I should use for as-safe-as-possible CAN sniffing would be very nice. I strictly do not want to go writing to the CAN bus at all out of fear of getting an airbag in my face or worse.

  
edit: The other thing I forgot to mention is: is there a handshake or similar between the head unit and Infotainment Controller or however they name that (that section of the CAN) to begin communication? Will the CAN controller for that section send messages if its terminated into a device that never sends anything back over the CAN?",5,1762228850.0,12,CarHacking,1762371396,2025-11-04 04:00:50,2025-11-05 19:36:36,"DesolationKun (Score: 3): Just go with any cheap can transceivers hooked up to Arduino or anything savvycan works with. I don't think it's possible to accidentally deploy airbags over can.

half-t (Score: 3): I know the VW cars only up to Golf V but there should be no significant changes to the Golf VI. There are three CAN busses connected to the instrument cluster:

1. Engine CAN: connects ECU, ABS/ESP/EDC, TCU and Airbag control module.

2. Comfort CAN: connects door control module, comfort control module, steering wheel control module and climate control module.

3. Infotainment CAN: radio/navigation, CD changer 

The airbag control module works for safety reasons independently from the rest of the car. Only if it detects a crash with its acceleration sensor(s) it will ignite the airbags. Then it will also shut down the engine via the engine CAN bus. The other usage of its CAN bus is for diagnostic purposes.

If you disconnect the instrument cluster, disconnect the battery, too and measure the resistance between CAN high and low. It should be 60 Ohms. If it's not 60 Ohms it might be that there is now a 120 Ohm termination resistor missing. Then check the resistance in the instrument cluster. It should then be 120 Ohms. Add a 120 Ohm termination resistor to your new connector to fix the termination.

If you connect something to the CAN bus keep the wires drilled like they are originally in the wiring harness.

For a longer extension of the CAN bus you can use two pairs of drilled wire of a Cat 5e cable. Cut the bus open and route one drilled pair of wires to your new connector and the other pair from the connector to the other end of the cut CAN bus. Now you have two wires on CAN high and two wires on CAN low connected to your connector.

In this way I connected the engine CAN bus to my laptop and it works flawlessly without any changes to the termination of the CAN bus.

I use [these](https://www.peak-system.com/PCAN-USB.199.0.html) CAN to USB adapters. They are very reliable and very well supported by Linux. You can use them like network adapters and then use the usual tools like Wireshark. The support is perfect. Not only for the software, also for the hardware. I bought a very old used one and I was not able to flash a firmware update because the firmware was too old for that. I brought it to the company and two days later I got it back via mail. It was  refurbished with a new wire and USB connector and with the most current firmware.

Vector is another company specialized in CAN but their prices are way too much for me.

1ool6li,Dealer damaged trim after detail,"We always use the dealer we bought our car from for deep detailing twice a year (full clean, wax, etc).  This was on their recommendation to ensure it was done well.  It was reasonable price so we did it as my wife really likes to maintain her car / keep it looking like new.

This time however when we got it back we noticed residue and stains on all the inside polished aluminum trim (doors, buttons, dash, ac vents).  We have gone back now 3 times and while it’s better it still looks like the surface is damaged and not cleaning properly (we only used water / microfiber) on it.

Right now we are at the stage of wanting the trim replaced and they are getting back to us on that. If that doesn’t happen we are trying to figure out our options.  Even if they do replace it, we are hesitant to have things like the whole steering wheel replaced due to the buttons on it being discolored or large parts of the dash.  Seems like that could lead to more issues.

Attached are pics of what it looked like the first time we got the car back. IMHO it seems like whatever that was damaged the surface of the aluminum.  They have polished them up but in the sun you can still see discoloration and when you touch it smudges don’t come off easily at all.  I used a brand new microfiber cloth with damp water as a test in one spot and it just makes it more discolored and not even with rest of the trim piece.

Is this something that can be repaired / cleaned in the car? We are very hesitant to try anything.  As I  tried a damp microfiber cloth on a small part as a test and it didn’t seem to work. Or are we just going to need to escalate / sue to get the pieces replaced?

I have a 2024 Toyota Corolla Cross Hybrid. I always park on a narrow road where I have to put two tires up on a small curb. Never had issues before, but today the car dropped off the curb really harshly and after that, I noticed my passenger-side door looks misaligned.

The door doesn’t close as smoothly and the gap between the door and the front fender looks uneven (picture attached). The car still drives fine, but the door alignment definitely changed immediately after the drop.

Has anyone experienced something like this?
Mechanic is checking for the alignment but he said fender needs to be changed etc. but it sounds crazy and like a manufacturer’s fault because the curb is very low maybe like 3-4 inches.

rear brake lines rusted

valve cover leaking (4/10) - can probably do this myself and do sparks after.

today the check engine light came on in my 2024 Audi A4 (first registered in June 2024, currently around 35,000 km). I scanned it with an OBD2 tool and it shows the code P066C – Glow Plug 2 Control Circuit Low.

The car drives completely fine, no loss of power, no strange noises, just the warning light. I already have a service appointment scheduled at Audi. The car still has factory warranty and I also have the Audi service package.

My question is:
	•	Has anyone else seen this code on a newer Audi?
	•	Is this something that should be covered under warranty?
	•	Or can Audi claim this is “normal wear” (even though the car is less than a year old)?

I’m a bit worried because glow plugs are technically wear items, but at this mileage/age it seems too early to fail unless it’s a defect.

1oo4nty,Lug nuts backing out,"Vehicle: 2018 focus RS
Lug nut: Bimec 10 spline 60degree conical 

I use my car as a daily driver during spring and fall and do a few HPDE events over the summer. Been doing this for about 5 years or so. I don’t drive a lot of miles on the street since we have other cars in the household and my work is not very far from home so the focus has a sum total of about 38,000 miles. Every spring, I swap out the brake pads for my high temp track pads and put on a set of 200tw tires which are mounted to a set of Konig Freeform wheels and once we’re into fall I swap everything back to the OEM set. 

This past weekend I did the swap back to the OEM set and when I started driving to work yesterday I felt like the steering wheel was vibrating and it seemed to get worse the longer I drove. So I turned around, parked the car at home and went to work in one of our other cars. Last night when I got home I started with a torque check on the lug nuts as my first step. Found that driver side lug nuts turned about 1/8th - 1/4 turn (all of them turned a bit) before they clicked. Whereas all other wheels clicked immediately at 90 ft lbs. So I thought maybe I didn’t put 90 on it….fine let’s do a test drive. Felt much better, but as I turned around to get home I started to feel some vibration again. When I got home sure enough the same lugs turned a bit again before clicking. This has never happened to be before and I’m planning to take the following steps:
1. Try 100 ft-lbs because I think that’s the spec that ford puts in the owners manual 
2. Try a new set of lug nuts
3. Try the stock lug nuts (I still have them but I don’t like them and don’t plan on using them) 
4. Take of the wheel and inspect the hub to make sure the wheel is seating right 

Are there any steps anyone here can recommend? Or is there a different sequence of above steps? I don’t want to jump to the conclusion that the studs have stretched - but is there a sure shot way of confirming it without taking the car to the shop?

1onz41b,Mysterious Quiet Honking Noise in My 2021 Honda CR-V Hybrid. Any Ideas?,"Hi everyone,

Just a quick note before we dive in: the video I’m sharing is awful because I just realized my dashcam’s sensor is damaged. But the **audio is clear**, and you can hear the mysterious honking noise I’m trying to identify. So no, it’s not your phone or computer acting up!

Now, here’s the situation:

I drive a 2021 Honda CR-V Hybrid automatic transmission (CVT), bought new, currently at \~40k miles. Since almost day one, the car occasionally makes a very quiet honking-like sound. I’ve spent years trying to figure it out, with no luck.

What I’ve observed:

* The sound isn’t audible from outside the car.
* Inside, it’s much quieter than a normal honk; more like a soft chirp or beep.
* It only happens at night or in low-light conditions, never in bright daylight.
* It occurs whether the engine is cold or warm, and in both electric and gas modes.
* Headlights are always on when it happens (as expected at night), but I haven’t tested driving without them.
* It only happens while the car is moving, never when stopped at a red light.
* It happens at any speed other than zero. 
* It’s not other cars honking at me.

I’ve read the manual, searched online, and even asked my Honda mechanic. They couldn’t reproduce the sound or identify the source. The car is well maintained and in excellent condition.

Tonight was especially strange: the noise happened **six times in under 30 seconds, as you can hear in the video**. Normally, it’s once every 30 seconds to a few minutes.

In the video, the honking sound is slightly louder than how I perceive it from the driver’s seat. The dashcam is mounted near the rearview mirror, in case that’s relevant.

I considered whether the dashcam itself might be making the noise, but it only plays a bell sound when powering on/off. I don't see why it would make random noise like this. Still, I’ll be replacing it soon due to the broken sensor.

1onvvby,Oil pressure/engine knock confusion,"Hi All! I feel like I’ve been put through the wringer at the moment and am seeking advice. 

Last month, we bought our 16 year old twins a 2020 VW Tiguan with 140k miles (Yes, yes, I know it’s high mileage, but the maintenance records seemed very much by the book, with all maintenance done on time at the dealership that owned the car). I had a PPI done and everything checked out good. The only issue noted was that the year brakes might need to be done sometime not too far down the road. I wasn’t scared away by the mileage due to maintenance history and the mechanic’s impression of the car after the PPI. 

We had the car for a few days when the “Oil pressure. Stop the car” light came on. It went off immediately, but I made an appointment at a German mechanic near me to get it diagnosed. I honestly thought it was going to be an issue with the oil used or the oil filter the dealership installed. 

Unfortunately, my mechanic told me that they detected a low end knock, and told me that we need a new engine. 

I immediately contacted the dealership to tell them in the hopes they would do right by us, knowing full well that we were likely just stuck in a terrible financial mistake. They asked me to drop the car off and had their mechanic look at it. Their mechanic replaced the oil pump pressure solenoid and 2 oil pressure switches. They said they checked  that there were no metal shavings in the oil pan (I think) and drove the car 130 miles round trip. They said it is all good now.  

We decided to take the car to get a few offers for trade-n, as we do not know whether to trust that everything is good and found that we are basically $8k upside down in the car based on the trade-in valuations. 

My question to you all is whether it is possible that my mechanic was being alarmist when he said we need a new engine. Might the engine actually be okay? I plan to take it to ANOTHER German mechanic for a third opinion now that the repair has been made, however, I’m just trying to wrap my head around everything I’ve been told and all the info I’m encountering through my research.

First, I'd like an opinion on the mechanic. I took it in and described the issue I've been having and even said I wondered if it was the head gasket. It will misfire on cylinder 1 or 2, is losing coolant, does not burn oil, oil is not milky. It has new plugs and coils.   
  
They checked it over and suggested a valve cleaning service which I did. They also pressurized the cooling system and found no leaks. I also bought new tires at their recommendation since they did not suspect the head gasket.   
  
It ran ok for about a month and then everything got worse. I returned and they did the exhaust leak test which was positive. Supposedly it was negative the first visit. They did not seem to want to recommend any further repair. When I asked about a replacement engine they said it would be too costly ($6000 for the engine). Should I go back to this place?  
  
  
Now after all of this it has to be a failed head gasket. Is it worth the time and cost to repair? The transmission has the same original miles. I did use a quick fix repair which stopped the misfire but the coolant keeps disappearing. The coolant will back right up into the overflow and doesn't pull back in. It's been a great car but I'm guessing it's time to let it go.

I started in Fall 2024, so I'll complete it sometime after Fall 2026 ;-; I miss working with my hands in a factory and I really don't want to do my current job for much longer.

  
I work full-time in the tech industry in L2 support in infosec for a very large mortgage firm - basically me and my small team are responsible for the sign-in, user-based, and security functions for 10K employees and many thousands of our clients' employees, who use our systems. It's a rotating 24x7 shift but outside of that, any of us are expected to work evenings (like 9pm - 12am) at a moment's notice for some maintenance or release or whatever, and regularly on Fri/Sat nights well into Sat/Sun mornings.

**TLDR**: it sucks and sometimes I get called at 7pm Monday, 9pm the next night, and 3am on Thursday so we can all be in a meeting fixing shit for 2-7 hours, while still working 9-5, and still losing family/personal time on weekends, and my sanity slowly draining. 

Unfortunately it does pay decently, I'm a junior on my team and I make just under $80k a year (no overtime), which isn't as much as it sounds near a major city on the east coast US.

  
Obviously I plan to quit soon™ and take my partial-or-completed degree and my good electronics and diagnostics and mechanical skills and go find an entry level automotive job. 

I'm very aware it will be a while before I make even $70k as a junior tech, even with a degree and 1-2 years of experience, getting ASE certs when I can etc.

What I'm asking for is **helping to visualise that scale of how early I switch careers**, incl. partial vs completed degree, vs how much I make and how I can advance early on to get to a livable or comparable pay scale.

Because right now, I only care about being able to pay rent and food and bills and tuition and have a couple hundred left over at the end of the month, and I know that's asking a lot when smart junior techs in my area are lucky to get $50-60k with a degree and no experience (despite what Indeed thinks).

I could be part-time at a shop (/parts desk etc) while I keep my current job, but I'm not sure that would be worth it for the time spent -> experience gained vs being full time and there all day and not having 2 jobs.

*Bonus info*:

I know computer hardware and electronics really well and probably want to be a diagnostician eventually, wherever that leads me, and obviously lean into that as a junior where possible.

I also want to/willing to work on diesels/heavy trucks/equipment, and my college has Diesel classes and a Diesel cert, but they take time away from/don't count towards my actual degree so I'm not taking them yet.

Here's the problem I have been chasing on my 2014 Honda CRV:

Yesterday evening EPS, VSA and TPMS lights all came on while driving. (See photo 1)

Get home, shut it off and restart a few times, dash lights are still there. 

Next realize I cant shift out of park, and after that realize there is no brake lights when pressing in brake pedal. Tail lights are still working though. 

Googling the issue brings me to faulty brake light switch which would check out for the lights not working, and possibly not being able to shift out of P due to it not registering the brake is being pressed.

Bought and installed new brake light switch, problem is still present. Checked fuses that I thought were relevant and all looked good.

Gave up, brought to honda dealer for diagnostic. They said they replaced blown fuse #16 in engine bay (see picture 2) and that lights cleared, was able to shift out of park no more problem. 

They think the blown fuse was cause by this fucked up looking break away flat tow braking system installed on the car from previous owners that is still there (see pictures) 

I go to the dealer to pick up the fixed car, start the car and boom lights are still there just like when I dropped it off. Technician comes out to look at it with me, blown fuse #16 again. We replace fuse, start it up and immediately blows the fuse. I did this 4 times.

He says he thinks its something to do with the the flat tow brake system and until I get it removed by a RV place its likely going to keep blowing fuses. Idk why his first fuse worked when they told me it was fixed.

Have owned this car almost a year and this has never been an issue. I can still drive the car by manually unlocking the shifter into neutral and starting the car, it drives great but as soon as I put it in park its stuck unless I manually shift it out. And also no brake lights if I do this. 

Only other thing I can find is it may be a bad shift interlock solenoid.

Also there's just random shit and wires hanging in the engine bay that is related to this brake system somehow.

Apprehensive_Shoe_39 (Score: 7): Outside and inside the windscreen: get some glass cleaner and give it a damn good rubdown. You need to rub it around until it evaporates. With a good lint free cloth (heavy paper towel *can* work but if it leaves behind lint then probs not a good idea).

If that doesn't solve the wipers streaking then new wipers may be needed. Depending on the model shouldn't be more than £20-30 for a branded pair.

Once you thoroughly clean the interior glass with cleaner and ensure there are no streaks remaining, never touch it again. Ever. Any spots of grease attract condensation. Use the aircon instead to demist, never a cloth/rag and certainly never flesh.

The mirrors, do you not have heated wing mirrors? Don't want to sound condescending but can't recall the last car I had without heated mirrors. Albeit, sometimes it's not obvious how to activate the heater. On mine you need the electric mirror control in the central spot and the rear demister on. If it's not in the central spot (eg you have it set to adjust the left or right) it doesn't activate the mirror heater when the demister is turned on.

You can add another manufacturer by adding &make=company in the url, for BMW and Volkswagen it becomes [https://www.autotrader.co.uk/car-search?advertising-location=at\_cars&make=BMW&make=volkswagen&postcode%3Dsn11ab&postcode=sn11ab&sort=price-asc](https://www.autotrader.co.uk/car-search?advertising-location=at_cars&make=BMW&make=volkswagen&postcode%3Dsn11ab&postcode=sn11ab&sort=price-asc)

You should see BMW and Volkswagen both highlighted in the blue pills at the top of the page

I know the mileage I do now will cause DPF issues eventually - but I also assume that’s not going to happen until around 80k which could take another 8 years at this rate. I have it serviced every year, and once a month I try and hit an 80-100 mile motorway trip hoping it helps the DPF. 

I really can’t justify paying for something newer and petrol/hybrid/electric just on the potential for DPF issues, but equally I can probably sell it and get reasonable value right now.

4 years time estimated to be worth **£11,700**

  
Estimate residual value of both cars in 4 years time is not too dissimilar either, again quite strange. 

  
I had a limit of £25,000 where there are quite a few 22/72 plate models, assuming coming back after PCP.. but just above, around the £26,000 area there are a lot of 24/74 plate models, assuming they are coming back from 1 year leases and demos.

  
I'm more keen on getting good value, so look at the drop after 4 years over the initial amount but these prices just don't make much sense to be as it's estimated to have a £600 difference in 4 years time when there is over 2 years difference in age.

  
My guess is that the 22/72 plates are slightly inflated as they are currently the cheapest/oldest versions of the newer Kia Sportage, meaning less supply so higher value.. Could this change in a year or two when there are a lot more on the market? Or will they hold well as they will technically always be the first ones of the newer models?

Any other ideas as I'm not sure what's best. Seems more sensible to pay the extra £2k for the 2024 car although always said I will never by newer than 3 years because of how quickly they depreciate ",0,1762284369.0,1,CartalkUK,1762371396,2025-11-04 19:26:09,2025-11-05 19:36:36,"EavisAintDead (Score: 2): I think people look at features + mileage these days rather than year.

From the above I make my marginal tax rate to be approx. 50%.

For example, there’s an SS deal for £450 a month with suitable mileage, with BIK being ~£20. This includes insurance, maintenance, tyres etc etc.

I currently own a car outright worth just over £20k.

This would save me £60 a month in insurance, £50 monthly maintenance budget, and £150 in fuel with it being an EV. I’d also put the £20k cash into a S&S ISA, which at a rate of 6% annually would increase by ~£100 per month. I also own my house which is a new build & is ‘EV charger ready’, and the lease deal includes one.

I’m trying to do a TCO comparison over 3 years, but I’m unsure on how much the £450 monthly payment will affect my take home pay. Is it as simple as it being ~£225 left, with my marginal tax rate being 50%?

- Nearside front coil spring fractured or broken 
- Exhaust backbox corroded
- Glazed bores leading to excessive oil use and failed emissions test

1oo14ov,UPDATE! Massively overcharged for headlights,"Original post: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/CarTalkUK/s/cxciw5Kz3F

Hey everyone, just wanted to post a proper update and thank you all again! 

Back story: 
We booked our Suzuki Swift 2015 for a repairs check at Halfords as both headlights were out. We weren’t sure if it was electrical or just the bulbs and since we’ve got a baby now, we needed somewhere nearby and convenient.

The staff called and said the issue was just the bulbs but apparently, they were “special bulbs” so it would be expensive - £327.50 for both. No options offered. 

I called back a bit later to agree, as my husband was stuck in meetings, I was juggling childcare and obviously just want it fixed. Done a quick research prior but again I don’t know the normal pricing for these things.

When we got the invoice, it wasn’t itemised, it just said “Renew both headlight bulbs x 2” with no part number or labour breakdown. My husband called to question them about the bulb type and another staff member confirmed again that they were HID bulbs and that he’d show the box when the car was collected.

My husband collected the car right before closing and the guy showed him a Philips D2S Xenon Vision 35 W box. When he asked for an itemised invoice, he was told they don’t provide those and to call customer service instead. They also said the garages are “different” from the retail stores so the prices online don’t match (as he questioned the price already). 

Later that evening, we emailed an initial complaint, at that point mainly about overcharging and no itemised invoice, but didn’t yet know about the bulb mismatch. We then checked the car the next day and took photos. 

A very kind redditor (thank you!!!) saw my post and helped push this up the chain internally. Not long after, someone from Halfords head office called, apologised, said this was very bad practice and confirmed a full refund will be issued immediately. They also said it would be looked into internally and I have requested for an update but obviously they won’t disclose full details. Something like this really shouldn’t happen to anyone else.

We’ve got everything properly documented, from the booking confirmation, invoice and call conversations to the photo of the Philips HID/Xenon bulb box shown to us at collection and photos showing what was actually fitted (which many of you kindly confirmed were halogens thank you!!).

Please be kind! We’re really not car people. We don’t know everything but who does? I’m sure we all have our blind spots 😄 We’ve definitely learned our lesson and will be learning a lot more about cars from now on 😅

I had already fed my feedback to Red Letter Days but thought I’d still go and enjoy my day. What I wasn’t expecting was a phone call on Saturday afternoon literally 10 minutes after I woke up after a 12 hour night shift.

My original booking was cancelled and had to choose a different date, supposed to be a “quick” phone call. Descended into further upselling with so-called “offers”. Then pressuring me further with a deal I had to lock in by the same time on Monday if I wanted to bring a friend or family member with me. “Oh it will be a great Christmas present!”. 

I stupidly paid the extra money apart from the extra person offer, but the guy did not read any T&Cs that it was non-refundable. 

Later that night I emailed to completely cancel, due to the tactics they had been playing. Still awaiting to hear from Red Letter Days but Everyman are refusing to cancel or refund. The tone of one lady on the phone was doing everything to aggravate me. 

These are supposed to be gifts, instead I feel rinsed at every opportunity. It was supposed to be my first supercar experience after many years of filming motorsports.

I’ve also heard people say about these track days that in something like a Ferrari with an 8.5k red line they weren’t allowed to rev it above 5k. Similarly, in other cars they weren’t allowed to go above national speed limit despite being on a racetrack. 

On the flipside, I did the Porsche driving experience up at Silverstone a few years back and that was lots of fun. Skid Pan, passenger lap with a pro driver, brake testing, acceleration test. I think these things are given away as a perk with a new car, but my wife had bought me the day as a voucher.

On a very different note, my wife was gifted a hotel voucher for her birthday but of all the 200 available hotels advertised. I think only one had a room at the price of the voucher, mid-week in Winter. We end up going somewhere nice and just using it as a discount.

ma7714 (Score: 33): I’ve done one of these experiences through Everyman for my son and whist the day was actually very enjoyable the constant upsell was ridiculous. At every point someone is trying to sell you something or pressure you into paying more. The insurance waiver cost as much as the actual experience - try saying no to that on the day and you get hounded relentlessly.

Ricky_Martins_Vagina (Score: 5): I was gifted a 'rally driving experience' with Everyman as a Christmas present a couple of years ago. It was actually two vouchers, intended for me to take a friend.

I work abroad full time and none of my trips back to the UK lined up with the event dates until a good 18 months or so beyond the validity date of the voucher but, to give them credit, there was never any issue with me still using it.

Arrived on the day and it was the big event at local airfield - tons of awesome supercars, but as you say it was very much a continuous turnstyle operation just trying to process as many customers through as possible. 

Non-participants were barricaded well away from the cars - an understandable safety measure but I can't help but feel that separation also enables them to upsell the professional photographs as you say, by not allowing relatives to get close enough to take a decent photo.

When I saw all the waivers and upgrade prices etc I was glad I was only there for the rally experience 😂 even more so when we went up the far side of the airfield, adjacent to the main 'drag strip', where it became totally apparent that none of the supercars were really giving it much welly at all.

At first I was completely underwhelmed by the rally section. More like a short loop of a dirt track with a bunch of cones marking it out, and a couple of beat up rally spec Ford Fiestas and a batter Subaru Impreza going round (in the promotional material it shows top spec Impreza, Mitsubishi Evo, etc). Since I had two vouchers and nobody available to come with me at short notice, I used one for the Fiesta and one for the Subaru.

Once in the cars, it was actually a lot of fun. I really enjoyed it and the 'instructors' were more than happy to not only let me, but encourage me to floor it and get the cars sideways around the turns etc.

The only thing I observed that did annoy me a bit was that there were sometimes up to 3 cars on the track, and if you had a relatively inexperienced or hesitant driver in one of them then the other cars could end up stuck behind them and really not getting to use the track properly which would have really pissed me off.

The rally bit was fun, I enjoyed it. As much of a petrolhead I am, I don't think I'd ever bother with doing the main supercar experience though and I'll be pretty annoyed if anyone ever gifts me that 😂"
1onvvll,Rights when returning a car purchased 10 days ago?,"Bought a VW Polo 2015 from a local used car garage on the 24 October. Drove it until the 29th & did 250 miles before noticing the windscreen wash fluid would leak into the drivers footwell when used, causing a chemical smell. Took it back on the 30th to be repaired and was told 1-2 days, it is now the 4th November & I still don’t have my car  (it is under 3 month warranty with external company)

EDIT- forgot to mention I haven’t heard from the company either, no update on my car, nothing. I called to ask what the problem was & when I could receive it & I got a stern “tomorrow” from them, no update on the problem or if it’s fixed

Paid the deposit on the 13th October & didn’t hear back until the 24th either so speed isn’t their strong suit, however after purchasing the car I figured things would be abit quicker?

The left mirror is also loose and rattles erratically when driving 40mph+ (forgot to mention when I took it back in) & also sometimes when I put the car in 1st with the clutch all the way down it doesn’t fully go in, unless taken back to neutral and tried again (usually takes 3 tries before it goes in).

Where do I stand in regards to returning the car for a refund? Trying to weigh up my options in regards to the problems the car has currently & what could arise in the future if I don’t act now, please no judgment, just looking for advice :)",1,1762223714.0,5,CartalkUK,1762371396,2025-11-04 02:35:14,2025-11-05 19:36:36,"Chaosvex (Score: 5): Because the car had pre-existing faults and you're still within 30 days of buying it, you have the right to reject the car and ask for a refund. They can, however, make a small deduction to account for the miles put on the car, although you've barely used it so it wouldn't amount to much.

Outline the faults in an email (so you have some evidence) and tell them you're rejecting the car and want a refund. You do not need to give them an opportunity to rectify the faults unless you've had the car for longer than 30 days."
