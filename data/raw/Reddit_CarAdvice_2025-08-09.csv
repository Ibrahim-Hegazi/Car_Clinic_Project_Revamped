1mlaupr,Mercedes 190e - tf is this creamy stuff in my trunk?,"Heyy,
I need some help figuring this out because I’m seriously confused.

In the trunk of my „new“ Mercedes 190E, between the fuel tank and the spare wheel well, there are a couple of small holes/indentations. Somehow, a creamy, greasy substance has built up there, it looks like oil mixed with water.

I removed a seal from underneath, and at least 2 liters (probably more) of this nasty stuff drained out. The texture is like a thick cream or grease. Plus some extra water after all the outer stuff was out.

I have no idea if this is old seam sealer, leaked cavity wax, or some disgusting blend of water and something else. But why would there be this much of it?

Any ideas what this could be, and should I be worried?",16,1754696882.0,9,MechanicAdvice,1754768007,2025-08-08 23:48:02,2025-08-09 19:33:27,"Independent_Basis805 (Score: 24): Its cavity wax. Rust prevention and a good thing to see

I also took a video of the tube draining when i noticed it coming out of the MC reservoir anymore and the drain bottle wasnt filling and confirmed. the column of fluid just rises slightly and dips back down. Letting my phone charge before I go back out.

1ml7e5z,"Could my mechanic have loosened my cv axle nut during inspection, brake pad/rotor replacement, or alignment?","I recently had a full inspection done on my car (2018 Mazda 3 Touring). The mechanic said everything looked good except for my front brakes, so I had him replace the brake pads and rotors. I also had him do a wheel alignment.  

Shortly after this, my car started making clunking sounds when shifting to D or R and sometimes when stopping and going at low speeds. The mechanic thought my suspension was bad… so I took my car in to a different mechanic for a second opinion, who found that my front left cv axle nut was loose. He tightened it and said the wheel bearing seemed ok, but that I should watch for any signs of an issue just in case. 

My question is, is it possible that the nut was loosened by the first mechanic during the full inspection, brake replacement, or wheel alignment? I find it hard to believe they missed it during the inspection (it was listed as being checked and ok in the report) and it’s suspicious that it got loose right after I had that work done.

1ml6t8g,Alternator back feeding,"86 Oldsmobile Firenza 2.0 liter v4
   Can’t find out for the life of me why the original exciter wire stopped working after short (positive grounded). Replaced bulb, popped in new fuze… nothing works. So I’m running this new line with a switch, fuse, and diode. Still doesn’t work. Looks like when I attach the exciter wire, it charges but backfeeding occurs someway somehow messing up idle.

Could this backfeed be occurring through another wire not the exciter, with the exciter connecting the backfeed-circuit? Using a bojack 6A10 diode which should handle it. Hm perhaps the red wire is doing it, cause it looks like the fuse link might have shorted although it still carries power

What should I check next? Why is my idle super low? Is it timing? I installed new timing chain (which was broken) and positioned dots together. Although If I remember right, the idle was getting crappy before the timing chain broke and the short. Idk what else it could be I’m not a mechanic. Cause when I take the exciter off after the battery powers up, the idle jumps up to normal, as if indicating backfeeding is wonking the idle. 

I need this car running it’s my only car. I think it only has 19,000 miles on it. I was tolddd it sat in a garage for 20 years. Was in pristine condition when I got it barely any rust. After siting outside in Florida the original pain has now rusted a great deal on top which tells me it was either driven in from another state or it really did sit in a garage for 20 years everything seems really good condition on it. 

Just need help fixing the idle. I drive the car for 2 years running beautifully. 

Everything I know: 
   . Timing chain broke
   .Sat for 2 years. 
   . Shorted it (Touched positive to ground with my wonky battery set up you can see in the video)
   .replaced timing chain (aligned dots. I think tdc is too dead center when sproket dots are at 12/12 cause rotor points to #1 at 12/12… I was driving it this way for years so yeah. 
   . After I shorted it, wouldn’t turn on for days till I took out two fuseless wires from the fusebox in the batt acc terminals. These terminals never had fuses while I was driving it. They take weird 1-prong fuses.
   I took the wires out of fusebox and then it turned on. So maybe the fusebox itself got jacked up? Maybe it fried wires downstream causing a backfeed? But another crucial bit of info is now I can put these two wires back in the fusebox and the car turns on, without fuzes in them. When before I had to take them out before the car would turn on. I had slipped a diy-made fuze into them so maybe it separated fuze contacts that were singed together and now it’s fine. Idk what these two wires are going to; maybe the exciter wire (even tho wiring diagram says gauges fuse is used for exciter). 
   .batt dash light wouldn’t come on when turning key to acc like it’s supposed to…

    But anyways I feel like the idle was getting worse before the short, when I was driving the car while the timing chain was slack. Sooo what might it be? Could it be as simple as spark plugs? Do I have a backfeed through some random circuit and how can I trace it and figure it out?  
   I mean heck the car probiably drives but I know the idle isn’t supposed to be this low.
   Yk what I remember some “mechanic” friends were messing with the idle from the throttle body. So maybe that? Maybe they adjusted it and it slowly loosened by itself… or maybe they made it too high and when other components started failing it adjusted and idk… 

But why would the idle go up to normal when I disengage the exciter wire after allowing it to charge????

Oil pressure switchs don't leak on these if anything it's runoff from the valve cover gasket leak. 

As for people shitting on the engine shampoo, I mean sure it sounds silly. But it is tedious cleaning an engine saturated in oil. Will they do a thorough job with the engine shampoo, maybe all going to depend on the tech doing it.

And the intermediate shaft leaking oil is just flat out wrong. They do look like they are leaking oil, but it's a sealed bearing which doesn't have any oil in it. It's actually the passenger front axle inner joint grease, because the inner joint uses a female splined hole to the intermediate shaft, the way they are machined it's actually hollow between the female splined hole and the inner joint and a plate/seal is installed to seal the joint from the splined hole.

CV grease can separate, kind of like peanut butter where the more solid parts of the grease settle and the liquid can leak past that seal, down the splines of the intermediate shaft and onto the aluminum housing that holds the shaft. So actually they have already fixed the source of the leak by replacing the axle, but it will probably still happen with the new axle. But it never actually causes a problem."

The Hemi uses roller style lifters like most modern engines, so the zinc really isn't necessary in general use. 


The reason that Hemi engines develop the ""Hemi tick"" is due to a poorly designed oiling system that does not provide enough oil flow at idle, which essentially starves the top end of the motor of oil when idling. The only real solution to this would be to replace the oil pump with an aftermarket high volume oil pump which provides more oil volume to lubricate everything.

Duratec he 

I just bought this car at 85,000 miles and it has an oil leak. Took it to the mechanic and they’ve said it’s the timing cover gasket and the oil pan/ sump gasket. They quoted £338 and while I don’t think that’s terrible (opinions welcome), I want to try doing it myself, it’s why I bought the car really is to learn how to fix it up. It’s also a big money saver.

It has a timing chain I believe instead of a belt so it’s also an area that the oil circulates as I understand it.

My question is I’ve been looking for the gaskets I’ll need to do the job and it’s turning up the squeeze-on, jb weld looking tubes. Is this right or am I looking in the wrong places?

I’ve seen it used in places so I know it can be used as a gasket but I’m not sure if they have different properties and such.

The last time I replaced a gasket was on a Lexmoto 125cc bike and that one was more like card.

If anyone knows where I can get these gaskets for this engine in the uk I’d rlly appreciate some advice.

It’s been having an issue lately, which I believe to be an electrical issue. The problem is that the issue comes and goes. Sometimes it’s only there for about an hour or two at a time. other times It’s there for up to a week.

Here’s the symptoms:
1) acceleration only works for a few seconds at a time. It’ll accelerate for a moment then suddenly fail. I take my foot off and accelerate again, and it works again for a few seconds and so on so forth.
2) when the acceleration issue is happening, my cruise control doesn’t work. It might engage for a few seconds and then stop or refuse to engage at all.
3) occasionally the rear parking lights don’t turn off after I’ve parked and turned off the truck. I remove the keys and lock the truck and they stay on. The fix for this so far has been to just press the brake pedal down while the truck is off and it stops.
4) the blower for my air conditioning is also occasionally working sub optimally. Sometimes it pumps full power, sometimes it barely pumps air other times it doesn’t pump at all. Fan speed control, temperature, and the location setting don’t seem to make any difference in this nor does using cabin air mode or AC mode.

TL:DR; Brake fluid leaks (seemingly only when depressing brake pedal slowly); Possible cause? Dropping car on top of metal ramps used to change oil or whatever fluids you might need to change in the front, but I’m not sure. 

Hello, everyone. I need some assistance/ advice in regards to what could’ve been the cause of a brake fluid leak. 

Recently (2-3 days ago) I started noticing when I put *gentle* pressure on the brakes, it doesn’t like to slow the car down, but when I put a bit more pressure on the brakes, they stop easily. 

I would check brake fluid reservoir after every trip (I go to work, before heading in I check brake fluid, I leave work and get home / get food, check fluid again, etc.), and for a bit it didn’t seem to be leaking anything. 

When I got home today, I tested something a little. What I did is gently press the brake as far as I can go before it initiates the brakes, and it went damn near to the floor. 

Then, I did the same test again, but putting more pressure on it, and it didn’t have to travel down basically at all before initiating the brakes. 

For context… a couple days ago, I got ramps off Facebook marketplace (metal ramps to do oil changes on or whatever else you need done on the front of the car. ) and in the process of trying them out, I actually managed to overshoot the ramps and I dropped my car on top of the ramps. 

These ramps are relatively small, wide enough for my cars’ (2012 Ford Flex) wheels, but not too much wider, and the ramps were behind the brake calipers and everything that I (assumed) would’ve been affected that would’ve caused the brakes to be leaking. 

I’ve not been to a mechanic yet, as I wanted to hear some ideas, since normally, the brake fluid would be leaking regardless, but only today did the brake fluid levels actually drop at all, which is why I thought it was a bit odd. 

Not sure if I hit anything, disconnected anything, I’ve got literally 0 clue what I might’ve done. 

As always, any and all help is appreciated. Thanks to everyone in advance.

I broke that...I went out and bought a 24"" 1/2"" breaker bar and gave it a few good yanks then tried the same with a cheater. No luck! The bar was already extremely flexing. I researched the amount a 24"" could take and usually it will snap at around 250 lbs ft of torque, I believe I'm nearing that. I was frustrated and getting careless so I accidentally rubbed the breaker against my rims and scratched a bit of the plastic coating off when I was putting my weight on the cheater. I gave it a few more full sends with the impact and seriously the bolt head is nearing toast. The E24 E Torx that originally fit in there needs the back of the hammer to pry off and if I want the bolt to fit in I gotta slightly hammer it in but I'm afraid if I hammer it inwards too much there won't be enough room to pry it back out of the socket. I'm dreading to attempt it again, but also I've done it so many times. Bringing the jacks and tools out of the garage its like clockwork for me. Every night I restore them in their proper location, telling myself just let a professional do it next morning. But honestly everything in my life I've been able to do when I've put my mind to it and see it all the way through. But this bolt weighting less then 2 lbs and isn't even able to talk back to me can be so cruel. People on YouTube just put a little elbow grease and boom the thing comes off with the least bit of struggle. Why is this bolt punishing me. I've tried having the wheel on the floor, a screw driver on the break caliper which should fundamentally be the same.

How is this possible that it is on so tight? I'm so frustrated that I'm becoming disoriented. I take deep breaths but still often finding myself off centred again. My physical and mental well being is somewhat taking a toll on this, if I do hate to admit. When lowering the car today I scratched a penny size mark on my lower side skirts where the mounting points are located. I doubt anybody will see but it's your own car so you obviously know where the nooks and crannies are which is bothersome, I'm sure everyone can relate.

I eventually come back to forums where people motivate me to try again next day. Tomorrow I will try getting some penetrating fluid and letting it soak. Tomorrow will be definitely my last day to attempt. The only thing I haven't tried is heating with a blow torch but that seems quite excessive on a bolt that is 9 years old. Supposedly this bolt is put on by way of torque to 180 Nm then loosen then torqued again to 120 NM and lastly turned to another 90 deg. Can someone explain the science on how come I can't take it off, if followed procedure does this equate to this conundrum? The science does not compute in my head.

I have no other outlet of releasing my thoughts so appreciate all your time and all the informative input you have given me. You guys have been very supportive and thank you for your time patience with a wannabe mechanic.”

Sounds like they went through it, they eventually took it to a shop which used a torch and 3/4 breaker bar to break it loose."

Estaba manejando mi Ford Focus del 2008 y, por el calor, decidí prender el aire acondicionado. A los pocos minutos de prenderlo, se me encendió la luz de advertencia de sobrecalentamiento del motor. Mientras hacía unas ""pruebas"", me di cuenta de que el ventilador del radiador no se enciende, ni a la temperatura normal de funcionamiento ni cuando prendo el aire acondicionado.

Intenté revisar los fusibles, pero la verdad es que no tengo ni idea. Solo noté que falta el fusible marcado como F15 y, encima, solo hay una terminal metálica (pin) en el zócalo del fusible. ¿Eso es normal? (Adjunto fotos.)

También agradecería si alguien me pudiera indicar cuál es el sensor de temperatura, para intentar desenchufarlo y ver si arranca el ventilador.

Gracias de antemano.

  
PD: I checked the mega fuse F1 and it was working perfectly, so I disconnected the cable from the ""Fan Control Relay Module"" and tested with a multimeter that from the negative to positive cable it gives 12V, and from negative to the blue (PWM) cable, when turning on the AC or reaching about 90°C, it gives voltage. So, I’ve come to the conclusion that the module is not working. I tried connecting the fan directly to the battery and it turned on. For now, I’m going to buy a new module; I hope it works.

1mkwtx3,2008 Toyota Rav4 2.4L Cylinder 3 Misfire - NOT PLUGS OR COILS,"**Background/Issue:** Wife drives 2008 Toyota Rav4, 215k Miles, 2.4L 4 Cylinder engine. Presented with low/rough idle when in gear (shaking the car, 550 rpm low), bad acceleration, especially from stopped or trying to accelerate past 55 on freeway on ramp. This is not EVERY time, but at least daily, usually when the car is cold (65 to 100 degree Fahrenheit ambient temps).   
  
**Tests/Repairs tried:** I initially cleaned MAF, throttle body, put seafoam in the tank for injectors, and replaced the replaced air filter. I also checked most evap hoses for cracks and replaced the PCV hose between the Intake manifold and valve cover (due to minor cracking). Then it threw a code for P0303, Cylinder 3 misfire.   
I replaced all the ignition coils and spark plugs - code popped up again within 24 hours. I pulled everything I had done, cleaned it all, checked gaps on the iridium plugs, put spark plug grease in the ignition coil boot to ensure a good connection, and put it all back together, torqued to spec. Of note - minor carbon deposits were present on Cylinder 3 Spark Plug when I pulled it to clean.   
You guessed it - a check engine light came back on as I drove home from O-Reilly/Autozone lot where I did the repair (about 2 miles).

**SO the question:** Assuming the code is the same P0303: What would you do next?

If the ac is off and it is in park its fine most of the time. Sometimes it acts up but not as severe. If the ac is on and it is in park it slightly does it sometimes. When the ac is on and in drive or reverse it does the rolling idle so much so thay if im at a stop light it will pull my car forward and shakes. It drives just fine. Ive checked the battery, alternator, cleaned the MAP, cleaned the throttle body (which has the IAC integrated) replaced the fuel injectors, replaced the O2 sensors, cleaned the valve intakes, changed the spark plugs and changed the ignition coils. Ive done the idle relearn procedure multiple times. Ive checked for vacuum leaks. Cold starts always start with rpms going straight up to 3000 and then it basically bottoms out, to either then act normal or do the rolling idle. I only get the 2 generic codes P0300 and P0316 SOMETIMES. Or I get a code that has absolutely nothing to do with it like my door chime or a rear vent actuators. They get cleared and dont come back.

1mkqerd,"Help me chose tires Continental, Michelin or Leonard for fuel consumption (and 91V or 94H)","I own a Golf VI 1.6 TDI with 195000km and some pretty worn tires in the front.

Right now I have 4 summer tires Continental 91V front and Michelin Primacy 4 91V at back.

Al tires are 205/55R16

I drive around 10000 kilometers a years doing 5.5L/100km on highway.

Question is, help me pick new tires for the front.

First, **is it worth to switch to all weather tires ?** i drive all year and never looked if it was summer tires before having to switch right now.

I plan to switch to all weather tires (is it worth it ???) and I found several references, **help me pick one please**. I chosed them according to price and european labeling :

* CONTINENTAL ALLSEASONCONTACT 205/55 R16 91V 86.4€
* CONTINENTAL ALLSEASONCONTACT 205/55 R16 94V 88€
* CONTINENTAL ALLSEASONCONTACT 205/55 R16 94HXL 86.4€

* MICHELIN CROSSCLIMATE3 91V 98.9€
* LEONARD 4 SEASONS 91V 68.5€

My main concern is the impact on fuel consumption as I'm driving mostly highway.

Also, would you pick lower tier brands (like the Leonard one for example) ? Hankook,Kleber,Uniroyal,.... are alsomt same price as Continental and I've nerver heard of lower ""Tigar"",""Westlake"",... brand Leonard are french made ""recycled"" tires where they pu new rubber on old tires, would you pick them ?",1,1754644467.0,1,CarTalk,1754768007,2025-08-08 09:14:27,2025-08-09 19:33:27,"Bomber_Man (Score: 1): Not from the EU, but in the US tires also have traction, temperature, and tread wear ratings. The last of these if available will be relevant to you. Higher tread wear numbers typically equate to a harder tire compound and less rolling resistance. It isn’t a perfect relationship, but the longer lasting the tire, theoretically the better the fuel economy. 

Another thing to consider is a different tire size. Thinner tires will reduce the contact patch with the road and get better economy (so maybe instead of  205/55 r16 you can get 195/60 r16 or something similar) Tires with a bigger total diameter will also help fuel economy as it will keep the rpm down. Also running pressures slightly higher than recommended, but I bet you already knew that. 

Just bear in mind there are tradeoffs for this improved economy. With the exception of increasing the overall diameter, all of these methods either reduce safety somewhat by reducing grip (friction), or possibly reduce tire life. It’s false economy to pay less for gas if you have to replace your tires more often."

1mkoo3x,"Volvo V60 AC compressor belt tear, timing belt skip","Hello everyone!

I am writing on behalf of my dad as he does not use reddit and I’m curious if anyone has any thoughts on the car’s situation. I am not with extensive knowledge about cars so I can only describe the situation to the extent I was in it.

My father’s car is 2013 Volvo V60 diesel 1.6. Recently, the clutch of the air-conditioning compressor was upgraded as the AC was not working. Not long after, we went on holiday - the first sprint was about 850 km. At about 620 km into the trip, we were at a border crossing, 35 degrees celsius outside, with the car moving inch by inch due to the long line. We noticed an odd smell, similar to the smell of the brake pad, and dark grey smoke was also coming from under the hood. My dad checked, and it was coming from the AC compressor. For the rest of the inching ahead, and the trip, he turned off the AC after starting the car (or it was turned off before stopping it) until the car was going in a good speed - the smoke stopped and the AC also worked fine.

After the 850 km, and a sleep, we started our trip again, with a few stops to sightsee and whatnot. We moved about 25-30 km ahead. After our last stop, the car was going slightly uphill, my father was taking up the speed as we just started the journey again. This time, the AC was left on before as we stopped to buy groceries beforehand. Just as we are rolling, my dad told me he felt like the AC was blowing warm air - I was in the passenger seat, I checked and the AC was in fact blowing warm air. Mere moments after, we felt a dull, generally quiet sound coming from the car, and in retrospect we could both feel ourselves pull forward, as if the car got caught in some kind of net and pushed back. The engine immediately stopped, and my dad could only steer to the roadside.

The car did not start afterwards upon ignition. There were no clanking, loud sounds, not when the tear happened, not when they tried to start the car. Upon receiving some local help as the car broke down next to a car repair shop, and upon my dad being more knowledgeable, it figured that the belt of the AC compressor tore, of which some parts, if not the entire thing, fell in the way of the timing belt, which is now probably skipped/misaligned (I do not know the proper wording here). The car could not be repaired and will be towed home from the 850 km distance and we had to find emergency stay for a few days.

My question would be - is there any hope that the timing chain only skipped once? Is there any hope that once it is put back into place, the car will start? From what I know from my father, once the mechanic takes a look and puts it back in place, and the car starts, the damages are not so bad financially and concerning the engine. If it does not however, he might as well consider getting a new car.",3,1754637601.0,2,CarTalk,1754768007,2025-08-08 07:20:01,2025-08-09 19:33:27,"PauloHeaven (Score: 1): An engine with the belt off timing bug not destroyed is a miracle more than anything else.

1mki5v9,Run Flats vs Regular tires,"I have a 2018 BMW 430i convertible and I’m trying to decide whether to stick with run-flat tires or switch to regular all-season performance tires. I currently have the Continental ContiProContact SSRs (run-flats), but they’re worn out and need to be replaced.

I like to have some fun driving fast on a highway or open road, but mostly just drive around in the city. And I live in Boston, so I need tires that can handle all weather conditions including heat, rain, snow, ice, and a ton of pot holes.

From what I read online it seems that run flats are a much harsher ride and poorer all weather performance than regular tires. So I’m questioning if it’s ok to give up the peace of mind of having run flats. 

I already carry a portable air compressor so wondering if having AAA and keeping an emergency puncture repair kit like this one will be enough -

Also my previous run flats were plugged once but I’m reading online that run flats usually can’t be plugged so wondering about that too.

Is it worth it to switch to something like a Michelin Pilot Sport All Season 4, and lose the peace of mind of being able to drive on a flat? 

Is the improvement in the ride really that much? 

And is the downside of not having run flats really that bad?

I’ve read that getting a flat on a regular tire can damage the rim of the wheel. Is that risk really a lot higher than on run flats?

The price seems similar for run flats and regulars, so that’s not much of a factor. Mostly I’m just looking for the best ride, with the best all weather traction and performance, while balancing the convenience in the rare occasion that I get a flat.

What did you do on your BMW? Stick with RFTs or ditch them? Any issues with switching?

Which tires do you recommend I get?

I know it’s either the battery  , starter, or alternator. 



But considering how it’s progressively died over time , would that mean it’s most likely the alternator?

The battery is brand new, we got it at the end of 2023

Now, my warranty is about to expire this month, and I’m considering canceling it to get a refund on the unused portion. I called the dealership’s finance department and they said my refund would be $0 because the warranty expiration date is coming up soon and the refund is based on time, not how much I’ve used it.

Curious_Hawk_8369 (Score: 1): Yeah, very common on steel body ford trucks, especially the super duty trucks. Ford puts that piece of foam in there that you can see through the rust hole for noise reduction. Problem is that foam is very sponge like, so it holds dirt and water against the inside of the panel, and eventually you end up with this situation.

The proper way to fix it, unless you really love the truck is too expensive in my opinion for its age. That said if you want to improve the looks a bit for cheap, get some fender flares. I personally don’t like the real big ones, but they usually make smaller OEM style ones.

You don’t have to, but if you do cover this mess up with fender flares, it is best to cut out as much of the cancer/rust as you can and then treat/paint any bare metal when you’re done. This will dramatically slow down the rate that it’ll get worse. Remember not to remove too much material though, or the fender flare won’t cover it.

I’ve done this process on one of my trucks twice now in the past 8 years, and if I don’t tell you, you’d never guess the wheel arches are long gone. I get compliments on that truck all the time, they can’t believe it’s 25 years old. Unfortunately, I’m at the point where if I have to remove the flares and address the rust again, I’ll have to get the big ugly flares.

Bolt/screw was the only thing holding it together creating a weak ignition. Got that replaced and it’s still misfiring but not as bad, and not audibly.

Also the engine light comes on and starts to flash only for about 5 seconds and when I speed up it goes away.

Going back to the start again when it was misfiring, I scanned it with an obd and it was showing cyl 1, 2 and 4 misfire, switched engine on and off and cyl 4 code went away. After replacing the obviously bad coil, cyl number 1 code went away leaving just 2 and 4.

I had no idea what was happening so I didn’t turn the fan off. After that incident, fan speeds 1, 2, and 3 stopped working completely but speed 4 still worked.

I stopped using the AC and the fan altogether and took the car to a mechanic. He replaced either the blower motor resistor or fan (I can’t remember which) and told me it was all good. He also cleaned out the AC drain area and said nothing was clogged. He couldn’t figure out exactly where the water was coming from during inspection.

I got my car back yesterday and on the same day while driving I turned the AC on again. The exact same thing happened, water started leaking from the same spot under the dashboard. This time I turned the fan off right away. I left my windows open overnight to let everything dry and I still haven’t used the fan since.

I really can’t afford to take it back to the mechanic right now so I’m hoping someone here might have ideas on what could be causing this and whether it’s safe to use the fan at all until I fix it.

They said it would take a couple hours and can pick it up same day. Called back next day and was told it needed to be jumped or battery charged because it won’t turn on and they’ll do it over the weekend and do the diagnostic on the transmission on Monday. I said ok.

Called back Monday said it wouldn’t turn on(I thought this was due to something other then the battery, now that it should be charged like they said. I now can infer that they never charged the battery until 4 weeks later)

Long story short I called back once or twice a week even went to check on it one day when I had a ride to see what the hold up was and they kept saying something about the dash not turning on or the battery still needed to be charged. Normally I would have removed the car by this point but my personal car is totaled so no ride. Week 3 I decide to get AAA and have them tow it to another shop but I had to wait 3 days for the membership to activate.

At the end of the 3rd week same day I was going to get it towed the manager calls me and says they jumped the car and when it turned on it was running too rough for them to drive it and do a diagnostic of the transmission so I need to come pick it up and it’s $150

I asked what is the $150 for if they couldn’t do the diagnostic he didn’t want to tell me. I asked him three times for an itemized list then he says we cleaned the battery terminals, charged the battery, cleaned the spark plugs, cleaned the throttle body, and checked the fluids. He said the charge is for 1 hour of work.

My sister called him and he gave her a contradicting story she asked what was wrong with the spark plugs that made you check it he said new spark plugs won’t fix the issue but later advised her on getting a tune up🙄 He told her they jumped it and it turned on but was running rough so they cleaned the throttle body. He also claims thst he doesn’t do engine work because it’s a transmission shop so I have to pay him and send it to a shop he recommends then when it’s fixed back to his shop for the diagnostic. Yet he did do engine work I didn’t authorize.

Other than giving it a jump I did not authorize any of this. I used to be a Fleet and Diesel Mechanic so this sounds very fraudulent to me.

I replaced the EGR valve 4 months ago, cleaned the throttle body, and replaced the power steering pump fluid. When coming to a stop, the RPM drops slightly and tries to go below 500 RPM.

If I shift into neutral before stopping or when turning at low speed, the RPM stays steady. However, when the truck stalls, it won’t start again and highlights all the gear indicators. After clearing the codes, the truck runs fine again. I apologize if the problem is obvious and I’m just not seeing it.

1ml1p03,Rear brake rotors,"Hellow, I just have a quick question. 

About 3 months ago I noticed distinct streaks on my rear driver's side brake rotor. The car brakes without issues, but it didn't sit well on me so I decided to go to my dealer and ask if someone could check them out. Their head mechanic said the rotor would be fine and I just needed to brake harder more often. Did that for the past month and the streaks didn't disappear, car still brakes fine though. 

All other rotors look clean and even, the pads have, from my understanding, enough life in them. On the affected rotor the streaks feel like they're about half a millimeter taller than the rest of it. There's no squeaking or grinding sound when breaking.

It looks to me that the pads don't, for what ever reason, contact the rotor correctly. Should I get them replaced or can I wait until September for the next scheduled service to bring it up again?

I am driving a Dacia Duster 3rd Gen Extreme, TCI 130 mild hybrid, front wheel drive, 20700km.

(Pardon for the rear pics of the brake, kinda hard to make decent pictures when the wheel is still on😅)

I can't see the lubrication on your calipers from your pictures, but this is usually due to not actually servicing some brake components when having components replaced.

There are slider pins in the bracket that holds the caliper, or in the caliper itself that require removal, cleaning and lubrication regularly. I literally do it every oil change but that's overkill

Should also be some lubricant on the top and bottom ears of the pads

If there is no signs of a small amount of grease or lubricant on your pads, or it looks very dry, you need a brake system service. They'll hear this and want to change your brake fluid or think you're wanting new brakes installed. Make sure to let them know you want the components taken apart, cleaned, and re-lubricated.

They look like newer rotors, but rather used pads. This isn't normal, both should be replaced at the same time. If this is the case, have the pads replaced as well, drive a bit and see if the streaks disappear as they should clean and lubricate everything during this process anyways. With the newer looking rotors, I am assuming you had new rotors installed without pads and they probably didn't do the job fully as they should.

I wouldn't be going back to the tech that told you just to brake harder lol

Nada_Chance (Score: 1): Suspect the caliper slide pins starting to seize and the inboard pad is doing all the braking.

1mkz12y,How does rev-matching a constant-mesh transmission reduce wear on the synchros?,"I keep hearing people say that rev-matching reduces wear on the synchros, but I don't understand how that is the case mechanically and would love to hear an explanation.

Here's my current understanding, which may be incorrect, but in short, is that the synchros only exist to allow you to shift from one gear to another, and when you are in gear, the synchros no longer do anything.

The synchros exist to help match the speed of the gear with the speed of the shaft. However, during the act of rev-matching, your clutch is disengaged from the input shaft, so at that point, engine speed has no effect on the input shaft speed.

During the rev-match (i.e. while the clutch is disengaged), you move the shifter into the new gear, which is when the synchros do (and complete) their job synchronizing the speeds to allow the shift sleeve to slide over the new gear.

The clutch isn't released until after you're fully in gear (otherwise you'll grind the synchros) at which point the synchros have already done their job and are no longer in play since the gear is already connected to the shaft.

So then at that point, how does the RPMs you release the clutch at affect the synchros?

To reduce wear on the synchros you'll need to double clutch. And the synchros exists to eliminate the need for double clutching.

Does anyone have any experience with MBF direct? As they have 4-5% APR low interest deals as well as a lot of extras.

I’d just like to know anyone experience if it was easy hard etc what age you are preferably younger people if anyone here has any experience at a young age. 

I’m looking to put down 8-11k for a car new 40k or if I get an approved used 30-33k. 

I’m hoping the bigger deposit makes my application more appealing. 

For starters I have been in my “full time job” for a year and probably have credit history of a year. 

Clean credit file with no missed payments debts etc. everything paid on time and stick to a strict spending of 200 max every month. 

Just want to go into this confident and clear anything.

Getting a new one from dealership after 10k depo, 15k miles and 48 months it is around 43-44k payable with the balloon included. 

The APR is really low and allows this to be the retail value of the car after interest. but if I was to get an approved used which is 30-34k with the 8-11.9% rates it will be the value of a new car which makes me think I may as-well apply for a new one.

I am aware it is harder to get accepted for a new one as they only allow finance from Mercedes and no brokers. If anyone works for MBF and has any advice or suggestions please let me know thank you.

1mkxqii,Most frugal way to buy a car,"I have been the proud owner of a 2011 ford fiesta for 11 years now, its just ticking up to 83,000 miles. It passed its MOT a month with a handful of advisories, and in the past couple of weeks has started making an awful groaning sound whenever I turn the wheel. 

Going to get a quote to get it fixed, but in the event that its a big job and would set me back hundreds, or in the event that it dies and I have to buy another car, what is the most financially sensible way of running a car?

(For info this would be my daily driver, with a 15 minute commute to work and the sporadic longer journey, my other half has a newer car we use for any trips away)

(For info again I have absolutely nothing in savings)

I have identified a couple of options:

- ‘bangernomics’ where I buy something bottom of the barrel for £1000-£2000 and run it into the ground - this seems the cheapest, however I dont like the idea of ‘living life on the edge’ and not know if I’ll actually make it to work okay. (Could put this on a 0% credit card)

- Buy a reliable used car outright (through loan/credit card), and run it for a decade (could put this on a 0% credit card if 6k or under, any higher would need a bank loan at around 8%apr). This is what I would be leaning towards, however I’m a bit lost on a ‘sweet spot’ of age/value/mileage that would get me the most use for my money.

I cant see the positives of financing, other than the bonus of driving a shiny new car - the idea that you could get to the end of the deal and have nothing to show for it blows my mind.

Yeah, they prefer people looking at their cars who *don't* know enough to spot problems with them.

I remember going to look at one car, and promptly lying down and sticking my head underneath it to see how badly corroded it was underneath (the answer was *very*; it blatantly needed both sills doing to get through an MOT done by anybody but the seller) and the guy just casually stated that the price was a starting point for negotiation and knocked the price down by two thirds to account for the work that needed doing to make it safe to move off of the forecourt before I said anything.  He knew how badly fucked it was.

If you just test drove it then i'm pretty sure that not a word would have been said on that subject, and great surprise would have been expressed (if not felt) about how fucked the car was when the new owner later discovered the defects.

I still have time (I started my last look with about 6 months to go) for my contributions to the finance deal to hopefully give me a bit of equity, and I won't be using it quite as heavily as the last 3 years due to the wife now having a car of her own, so less miles might make it a bit more appealing.

1. Hand it back and walk away
2. Use any equity to trade in for another deal
3. Make the final payment (either through cash or separate borrowing) and take ownership 

I’ve done all three in the past.

In this situation, I would understand if you are a “no equity” or “negative equity” position. A quick online valuation through one of the platforms will give an indication as to whether the car is worth more, less or the same as you will owe under your final payment. 

If I was in your shoes, I’d do the following: I it’s worth no more than you owe, then choose option 1 or 3 (depending on whether you like the car). If it’s worth less I’d be inclined to go with option 1, walk away and start a brand new deal. 

The last PCP we had started pre-Covid (so before the stupid price rises we have had to tolerate). When it came to the end of the deal I paid the final payment from savings as the car was (on paper) worth more than the amount owed and I was happy to keep it. The latter part was important - I’d have done something different if we weren’t fine with continuing to own and drive the car.

1mkq0gg,What hatchback to buy as first car with modern features and nice comfortable interior,"Hi car experts,

Sorry, its ended up as a bit of a wall of text. TLDR at the bottom if you understandably cant be bothered reading all of it.

Im getting into driving fairly late compared to most, as Ive lived in London my whole life and public transport here has always worked well enough for me, but due to some personal life stuff going on it now makes sense for me to have a car. 

Im currently getting completely lost on autotrader trying to work out what is the difference between all the different models etc. and thought i'd just ask people who know a lot more than me. I dont really know much about cars so thought i'd ask some experts. 

I dont need anything particularly speedy or fun to drive, i guess i'd definitely prioritise comfort and safety over that. Budget is probably about £15-20k although obviously cheaper would be nice.

With limited driving experience I'll probably get a hatchback as I don't really want a longer car in the city. I think for the same reason I'd also like to get as many modern driver assist features as possible. I dont really have easy access to any charging so electric cars are out. I suppose the perfect car would have :

* auto hold
* hill assist
* lane assist
* traffic jam assist
* adaptive cruise control
* blind spot monitoring
* automatic emergency braking
* traffic sign recognition (i keep missing them lol)
* 360 parking sensors
* parking assist
* adaptive headlights
* auto wipers
* dimming rear view
* sunroof would be nice
* a nice screen display for navigation etc. , physical buttons for things like AC etc. would be nice though
* electric seats

At the moment im leaning towards an Astra, mainly because it just has 3 'levels' instead of being able to choose 50 different options, which makes it a lot easier when looking for used ones on autotrader compared to a golf etc.

TLDR : What are my options for a non electric hatchback with lots of modern driver assist/safety features, with a comfortable interior, ideally a sunroof and a budget of £15-20k. Doesnt have to be a brand new car.

VW Golf R / Seat Leon equivalent £15,000 to £18,000: Fairly cheap to buy, decent MPG when not going hard, hugely common and still just a 2.0L engine should make repairs not too dissimilar to a regular Golf. 

Lexus RCF  £28k: More expensive outlay, but Lexus reliability and potential 10 year warranty if you maintain Lexus main dealer servicing.  I'm not too sure on other running costs, but MPG will be less than a Golf R and I suspect services and the likes will be expensive.

BMW M140i £16k-£18k: Similar situation to the Golf, they're cheap to buy initially, BMW 6 cylinder engines are typically decently reliable and run well day to day.
