(edit) So to sum up, clear headlights with smoked tail lights? Or clear headlights with stock tail lights?

Do you guys have any opinions?

I attached a picture of what the smoked tail lights would look like and also what stock ones look like.

1mkz0xv,My 2018 ford explorer 2.3l ecoboost cant seem to figure out jow to idle.,"A few weeks ago I had my head gasket changed. And since then my rpms do this. If the ac is off and it is in park its fine most of the time. Sometimes it acts up but not as severe. If the ac is on and it is in park it slightly does it sometimes. When the ac is on and in drive or reverse it does the rolling idle so much so thay if im at a stop light it will pull my car forward and shakes. It drives just fine. Ive checked the battery, alternator, cleaned the MAP, cleaned the throttle body (which has the IAC integrated) replaced the fuel injectors, replaced the O2 sensors, cleaned the valve intakes, changed the spark plugs and changed the ignition coils. Ive done the idle relearn procedure multiple times. Ive checked for vacuum leaks. Cold starts always start with rpms going straight up to 3000 and then it basically bottoms out, to either then act normal or do the rolling idle. I only get the 2 generic codes P0300 and P0316 SOMETIMES. Or I get a code that has absolutely nothing to do with it like my door chime or a rear vent actuators. They get cleared and dont come back. I dont know if my throttle body or MAP is just bad or what. But I have at this  suv for 4 years and I have never had this issue before. Im to the point I'm going to run this shit off a cliff. It also doesn't help that no one has ever worked on a 2018 ford explorer 2.3l ecoboost turbocharge according to the internet. Everything is 3.5l or something. And yes I know those engines are notorious for being peices of shit but I didn't know that at the time i bought it. Lesson learned I guess.

The last of these if available will be relevant to you. Higher tread wear numbers typically equate to a harder tire compound and less rolling resistance. It isn‚Äôt a perfect relationship, but the longer lasting the tire, theoretically the better the fuel economy. 

Another thing to consider is a different tire size. Thinner tires will reduce the contact patch with the road and get better economy (so maybe instead of  205/55 r16 you can get 195/60 r16 or something similar) Tires with a bigger total diameter will also help fuel economy as it will keep the rpm down. Also running pressures slightly higher than recommended, but I bet you already knew that. 

Just bear in mind there are tradeoffs for this improved economy. With the exception of increasing the overall diameter, all of these methods either reduce safety somewhat by reducing grip (friction), or possibly reduce tire life. It‚Äôs false economy to pay less for gas if you have to replace your tires more often."

1mkoo3x,"Volvo V60 AC compressor belt tear, timing belt skip","Hello everyone!

I am writing on behalf of my dad as he does not use reddit and I‚Äôm curious if anyone has any thoughts on the car‚Äôs situation. I am not with extensive knowledge about cars so I can only describe the situation to the extent I was in it.

My father‚Äôs car is 2013 Volvo V60 diesel 1.6. Recently, the clutch of the air-conditioning compressor was upgraded as the AC was not working. Not long after, we went on holiday - the first sprint was about 850 km. At about 620 km into the trip, we were at a border crossing, 35 degrees celsius outside, with the car moving inch by inch due to the long line. We noticed an odd smell, similar to the smell of the brake pad, and dark grey smoke was also coming from under the hood. My dad checked, and it was coming from the AC compressor. For the rest of the inching ahead, and the trip, he turned off the AC after starting the car (or it was turned off before stopping it) until the car was going in a good speed - the smoke stopped and the AC also worked fine.

After the 850 km, and a sleep, we started our trip again, with a few stops to sightsee and whatnot. We moved about 25-30 km ahead. After our last stop, the car was going slightly uphill, my father was taking up the speed as we just started the journey again. This time, the AC was left on before as we stopped to buy groceries beforehand. Just as we are rolling, my dad told me he felt like the AC was blowing warm air - I was in the passenger seat, I checked and the AC was in fact blowing warm air. Mere moments after, we felt a dull, generally quiet sound coming from the car, and in retrospect we could both feel ourselves pull forward, as if the car got caught in some kind of net and pushed back. The engine immediately stopped, and my dad could only steer to the roadside.

The car did not start afterwards upon ignition. There were no clanking, loud sounds, not when the tear happened, not when they tried to start the car. Upon receiving some local help as the car broke down next to a car repair shop, and upon my dad being more knowledgeable, it figured that the belt of the AC compressor tore, of which some parts, if not the entire thing, fell in the way of the timing belt, which is now probably skipped/misaligned (I do not know the proper wording here). The car could not be repaired and will be towed home from the 850 km distance and we had to find emergency stay for a few days.

My question would be - is there any hope that the timing chain only skipped once? Is there any hope that once it is put back into place, the car will start? From what I know from my father, once the mechanic takes a look and puts it back in place, and the car starts, the damages are not so bad financially and concerning the engine. If it does not however, he might as well consider getting a new car.",3,1754637601.0,2,CarTalk,1754753162,2025-08-08 07:20:01,2025-08-09 15:26:02,"PauloHeaven (Score: 1): An engine with the belt off timing bug not destroyed is a miracle more than anything else.

Curious_Hawk_8369 (Score: 1): Yeah, very common on steel body ford trucks, especially the super duty trucks. Ford puts that piece of foam in there that you can see through the rust hole for noise reduction. Problem is that foam is very sponge like, so it holds dirt and water against the inside of the panel, and eventually you end up with this situation.

The proper way to fix it, unless you really love the truck is too expensive in my opinion for its age. That said if you want to improve the looks a bit for cheap, get some fender flares. I personally don‚Äôt like the real big ones, but they usually make smaller OEM style ones.

You don‚Äôt have to, but if you do cover this mess up with fender flares, it is best to cut out as much of the cancer/rust as you can and then treat/paint any bare metal when you‚Äôre done. This will dramatically slow down the rate that it‚Äôll get worse. Remember not to remove too much material though, or the fender flare won‚Äôt cover it.

I‚Äôve done this process on one of my trucks twice now in the past 8 years, and if I don‚Äôt tell you, you‚Äôd never guess the wheel arches are long gone. I get compliments on that truck all the time, they can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs 25 years old. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm at the point where if I have to remove the flares and address the rust again, I‚Äôll have to get the big ugly flares. My OEM style ones won‚Äôt cover the damage if I remove anymore material."
