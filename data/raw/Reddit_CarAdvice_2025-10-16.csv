1o7r5ev,21 Honda Civic feels floaty after wheel hub replacement.,"Sorry in advance if this is long.

A few months (maybe 3-4) I got a new set of tirs put on at which point the guy said one of my wheel studs was broken. 
Took it to a shop a couple weeks later, where they replaced the entire wheel hub assembly. 

Fast forward to last week and as I'm turning into my driveway I hear a very loud metal to metal clank sound and the remaining three feet I drove in produced a horrible grinding sound from the front left wheel (the same wheel that had the hub assembly replaced).

Had it towed back to the shop the next day. When my husband talked to the guy on the phone he made a comment about the right wheel hub being replaced but then quickly corrected himself.

They kept the car until the next day, and then claimed it was a rock in between the brake and rotor. I have had that happen before, it was not that.

Nonetheless, we got the car back and it actually felt like it was driving smoother than before. However, now whenever I'm driving on a curved freeway entrance, it feels like I'm about to spin out even if I'm going relatively slowly.

I'm taking the car to a different place to have it checked out, but I'm curious if anyone has any ideas what could cause this potentially. Mainly on account of its been raining for a few days so I fully expect for whoever I deal with to tell me it was the wet roads so I would like to at least be able to point them in a general direction.",1,1760572094.0,4,MechanicAdvice,1760643270,2025-10-15 23:48:14,2025-10-16 19:34:30,"QwopperFlopper (Score: 1): Are the lug nuts tight on the wheel?

The issue he’s been having with it seems to be rather complex. First he was having trouble starting the car, so I replaced the alternator and battery with parts from the junkyard (reman battery and used alternator) and that seemed to fix the problem for a few weeks but now he’s having trouble starting it again. Usually it will start with his jump box but it misfires and I notice the lights seem to be flickering when it runs. So I went back to the junkyard and pulled a new ignition module and two of the three coils (I should have just got all three but I was being cheap). When I took off his old ones I noticed they had definitely been changed before with non OEM parts. So anyways after I did that and triple checked I had the spark plug wires in the correct order I jumped it again with the jump box and barely got out of the parking lot before it died again. My friend said that had happened before and he had to jump the car on the side of the road which is terrifying. So I plugged in the OBDII box and got a P0300 misfire code, so I tried swapping over the only old coil I had installed which was 1 and 4 and swapped it with the coil that was 3 and 6, and now I’m just waiting for the jumpbox to charge back up so we can start it again. Like I said we’re just barely scraping the surface on all the work that needs to be done to this POS but he needs something to drive to work. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Unfortunately, there's no easy way to verify temperatures or see what the computer thinks is happening without some kind of equipment, be it a data reader (scan tool, good code reader) or some kind of a non-contact temperature measuring device (thermal camera, infrared temp gun, etc.).

Highly unlikely to be a water pump (though not completely impossible), and a heater core won't affect engine temperature beyond potentially lowering it slightly by pulling heat out like the tiny radiator it is. You could bypass the core completely and it won't cause the engine to run hot. A clogged radiator could also cause high temperatures at speed (rad fan is only a concern at low speed), but this would also be exceedingly rare without some kind of obvious coolant contamination in a vehicle that new and using that type of coolant.

I was given a 1998 Dakota Sport with 218k miles and as I'm going through it, I've been addressing things after thing.  Most recent was a gushing coolant leak from the corner of the timing chain cover and a very leaky front main seal.

1o7m24i,Can’t get serpentine belt back on my 2012 Toyota Camry 2.5L (2AR-FE) - I’m losing my mind 😩,"
Hey everyone,
I’m working on my 2012 Toyota Camry 2.5L (2AR-FE).

I replaced the alternator and now I’m trying to reinstall the serpentine belt.
The belt is new (Duralast 6PK1255), the tensioner is also new (same size as OEM).
I’ve checked the routing like ten times - it’s correct, goes under the tensioner, around the A/C compressor, crank pulley, water pump, alternator, and idler.

The problem:
Even when I pull the tensioner all the way down, the belt is still about 1 cm too short to go over the last pulley.
I tried every possible order - last on alternator, last on water pump, even tried heating the belt a bit.
It just won’t go on.

Everything matches the old parts, nothing’s seized, and the belt grooves are aligned everywhere.
At this point my hands are bleeding, my back hurts, and I honestly don’t know what else to try.

Is there some trick for this engine?
Like a certain sequence or a way to preload the tensioner?

Any help or advice would be really appreciated 🙏

I’ve been losing coolant slowly, but I can’t find any obvious leaks. Here’s what I’ve checked and noticed so far:
	•	Oil looks clean (no milkiness or signs of coolant mixing)
	•	No white smoke or sweet smell from the exhaust
	•	I do see bubbles forming in the radiator when it’s hot — not sure if it’s just boiling or combustion gases
	•	I added fluorescent dye to the coolant and went over the whole engine bay with a black light — no signs of coolant leaks anywhere

At this point, I’m leaning toward a possible head gasket issue, but I’m not totally convinced yet. I’ve got a video of the bubbling in the coolant reservoir if that helps.

Also — is it safe to keep driving it like this for now, as long as I keep an eye on the coolant level and don’t let it run low? Or could I risk doing real damage if it is a head gasket starting to go?

Has anyone seen similar symptoms on the 3.6 Pentastar? Anything else I should check before jumping to a head gasket?

My car broke down yesterday and had to get towed.

The engine has starts, if a little reluctantly at times, and revs fine. However, there is little to no power when you're on the move. It cuts out completely on a hill even in first. 

The mechanics that came out are certain it's fuel related. There is a smell of fuel in the cabin even when idle which makes them think it's fuel injector related namely one is stuck open?

They also thought one could just be faulty. 

Furthermore, they thought it could be contaminated fuel possibly. 

Anyone got any ideas here?

The vehicle bmw 320i N46 was missing with present faults on coil 2 and 4 open circuit. Initially as process checked pulse, earth and power all tested ok. We replaced the coils and the fault was gone. We did notice a chain rattle and the vehicle has a historical oil pressure issue. We reported this to the client in writing. He drove it and the misfire returned: same codes. We did a deeper dive checking the pins, continuity to ecu etc. Opened the ecu and found burned tracks. We advised the client to get the ecu repaired and suggested that the oil pump and chain get done. 1 day later the client first queried the hours charged on the quote and then proceeded to threaten us with high court action if replacing the parts do not resolve the issue. We advised him the the core issue is the ecu and that the chain and oil pump if not attended to will likely give him problems in the not to far ahead future. He transferred the funds for the pump and chain and gave go ahead. The issue I am facing is, if the person who repairs the ecu does a poor job he will be holding us accountable as we have stated to him that it is the cause of his misfire issue.

I really need some advice because I’m completely lost right now.

Yesterday, I tried to start my 2023 Nissan Sentra. When I pressed the start button, the car made a strange sound, so I turned it off right away. When I tried again, it wouldn’t start at all .  the lights, radio, and dashboard still came on, but the engine wouldn’t crank.

The brake pedal was really stiff and hard to push, and the steering wheel was locked. I thought it might be the key fob battery, but I just replaced that. I tried jumping the car, but it still didn’t do anything.

I ended up having to get it towed, and the tow truck driver had to force it into Neutral because it wouldn’t shift gears normally. Now the dealership wants to charge me $232 just for diagnosis, and they said it could be another $450 if it’s the main car battery.

I’m a college student in Las Vegas (originally from Indiana), and I don’t really have anyone out here to help me with car stuff, so I’m trying to figure out if there’s something I missed or something I should know before paying all this.

Has anyone had this happen before with a newer Sentra or push-to-start car? Could it really be just the battery, or something more serious?

1o7h45n,Dealer says wheel hub needs replacement for grinding noise — should I get a second opinion or just fix it?,"Hey everyone,
Looking for advice on what to do next with my 2021 Jeep Grand Cherokee (59k miles).

I brought it to the dealership for a diagnostic ($180, but $ goes to repair if anything repaired) because it makes a grinding noise when I turn the wheel all the way to the left at low speed. It’s still under the 5-year/60k-mile powertrain warranty, so I wanted to be proactive.

The dealer confirmed the noise and said they recommend replacing the wheel hub assembly, quoted $644 after tax. They said they’d test drive it again after replacement to check for any issues at highway speed.

I’m a bit skeptical since the wheel hub isn’t covered under the powertrain warranty, so it feels like they jumped straight to a non-warranty repair. I also just had the brakes replaced last month at a local shop, so I’m wondering if the noise could be related to that work instead.

Options I’m weighing:
	1.	Get a second opinion from a trusted local mechanic to confirm if it’s really the hub or something brake-related.
	2.	Just authorize the dealer repair and hope it resolves the issue before the warranty expires.

Has anyone else dealt with something similar — a grinding noise when turning, or a dealer recommending a non-warranty repair right at the edge of coverage?

Sway bar end links are super easy to replace.  Thrust arms or control arm is not necessarily hard, just time consuming and you need the right tools. 

My gut tells me that you will get a quote somewhere between $500 and $1700 depending on what they want to replace.  

You will also need to get a front end alignment after parts are changed.


It almost sounds as if they tightened the control arm with the front end suspended vs tightening the bolt to spec when the hub was lifted or at ride height.  

Sounds like the bushing is not happy and will need to be replaced sooner than later.

My car (2012 ford escape hybrid) started going idle once hitting 20 mph. I took it to a regular mechanic a couple weeks ago who said the problem was with part of the hybrid system and therefore it had to go to Ford to fix. I took it to ford, they said the issue was that the hybrid inverter coolant pump was inoperative so that would be what’s causing the issue. They also said there was a suspected transmission leak, and to run a diagnosis would be $200.
I said I did not want to invest a ton of money into this car, so we should do the transmission leak diagnosis first, as I had no interest in doing other work if the transmission was out. They back pedaled and said the main issue was the coolant pump. Ok, I approved the pump.
Now a week later they’re saying they put the pump in, the car is still doing the same thing, and the issue is the transmission…which is $18k but they also don’t even make it anymore. They said the car is “toast”.

1o7ocvs,Hole in frame - worth fixing to pass inspection?,"My father bought a new truck and thought my eldest son might want his old one.  It's a 2013 Ford F150, but had been in Northern Ontario and has some significant rust.

We took it in to get a safety inspection and they gave us a laundry list of repairs needed (brake pads, rotors, caliper, steering shaft, sharp rusted out wheel well, electronic locks not working - could be manually locked -, seized rear door, etc).  They priced out repairs for about $7k.  My husband ordered parts and worked on the truck to address what they listed.

We ended up going to a different place to do the safety again (our regular shop this time) as the original safety was expired - we had 10 days to repair and bring it back without having to pay for the safety again.

This time, the mechanic noted a hole in the frame near the front right catalytic converter,  which the first shop didn't mention.  He said a body shop will need to assess the extent of damage and repair for it to pass.

The truck is 12 years old and has 266,000km.  I'm just wondering if we should even pursue this farther with a body shop?  Can anyone tell by this photo?  We spent about $1500 on parts already.

I’ve got a 2008 Volkswagen Polo (1.4 petrol), and I recently noticed a small brake fluid leak. After checking the reservoir, I realized that the rubber hose connected to the reservoir nipple is loose — it kind of wobbles or “dances” around the fitting.

When I touch it, I can actually see fluid seeping out slightly from where the hose meets the reservoir. There’s no visible crack, but it seems the hose no longer seals tightly on the nipple.

Has anyone dealt with this before?
Would it be okay to cut a bit off the hose and reinsert it with a clamp, or should I just replace the entire hose (or reservoir)?

Also — just to be clear — I know not to drive it until it’s fixed, since it’s the brake system. I just want to know if this kind of loose fit is common with aging hoses or if the reservoir fitting itself might be worn.

After a long thanksgiving weekend, I was working to replace lower control arms and split CV boots on my 13 Ford Taurus. This marks the 4th time I’ve changed the shafts as the boots never seem to make it longer than a year for the 4 years I’ve had this car.

After many long hours of fighting with the ball joint bolt that inevitably needed to be cut off, I was trying to install the new shaft and having barely any strength left to force the knuckle down enough to slide the new shaft in, the new shaft rubbed against the shock tower and ripped the brand new boot. Cue the 5 stages of acceptance.

The tear is only the width of my thumbnail and it’s right up against the larger clamp. I initially covered it with a zip tie cause I only need this car to last one more year (and winter) and I start a new job next Monday. I had to drive around yesterday to get more parts (long story) and it weeped out only a little grease staying off the highways and pulling over to check it regularly.

I did some research and found that Shoe Goo and Flex Seal seems to be a viable option to keep it together. So far I’ve done two coats of the shoe goo, planning on doing a third layer today once it cures. Afterwards I plan on 2 layers of Flex Seal spray just to ease my mind a bit.

1o75ugw,Does location or site really change what you pay for a Vespa electric scooter?,"Hey everyone, I've been researching these Vespa electric scooters, and I think I'm not the only one interested in them. Depending on where you look, the price variations are startling. The model and features aren't the only differences; it appears that region and seller type also have a significant impact on what people pay.

I discovered that the official ""Elettrica"" model from Vespa seems to cost about $7,499 in a lot of places. The same model, however, is listed for about NGN 2,933,319 in Nigeria, where import duty, shipping, local taxes, and dealer margins all play a significant role after conversion.

Alibaba has listings for Vespa or ""Vespa-style"" electric scooters. Some are clearly retro designs or look-alikes rather than the true Vespa brand. Those are significantly less expensive (though quality, parts, and warranty vary).

My intuition tells me that, even for the same ""official"" model, you may pay more if you live in an area with high import duties and few Vespa dealers. On the flip side, buying from sites (or suppliers) that ship from nearby warehouses or via Alibaba factory sources can help if you account for all the extra fees and risk.

Since it's an AWD vehicle, you can also check the driveline for loose or worn out parts as well, such as the CV axles for torn boots at all 4 wheels, as well as the driveshaft going down the middle of the vehicle from front to rear.

Based on your detailed description and common issues reported by other Malibu owners, here are the most likely culprits and suggestions to address them:

---

🔧 Most Likely Causes of Your Steering Issue

1. Steering Torque Sensor Malfunction

• What it does: Measures how much force you’re applying to the steering wheel and tells the electric motor how much assist to provide.
• Symptoms: Erratic steering feel, resistance when turning, aggressive return-to-center behavior.
• Fix: Sensor replacement or recalibration. This is a known issue in 2008–2012 Malibus 9F742443-6C92-4C44-BF58-8F5A7C53B6F1.


2. Electric Power Steering (EPS) Control Module

• What it does: Controls the motor that assists your steering.
• Symptoms: Inconsistent assist, heavy steering, or sudden loss of assist.
• Fix: Module replacement. Some vehicles had recalls or service bulletins for this 9F742443-6C92-4C44-BF58-8F5A7C53B6F1.


3. Steering Column Assembly

• What it does: Houses the torque sensor and motor.
• Symptoms: If the internal motor or sensor is failing, it can cause the wheel to fight you or feel overly weighted.
• Fix: Full column replacement may be needed if individual components can’t be serviced separately 9F742443-6C92-4C44-BF58-8F5A7C53B6F1.


4. Steering Position Sensor

• What it does: Detects the angle of the steering wheel to help the system provide proper assist.
• Symptoms: Poor centering, twitchy steering, or pulling on uneven roads.
• Fix: Sensor replacement or recalibration 9F742443-6C92-4C44-BF58-8F5A7C53B6F1.


---

🛠️ What You Can Do Next

• Scan the system: A diagnostic scan can reveal fault codes from the EPS module, torque sensor, or position sensor. Even if you’ve had alignment done, this step is crucial.
• Check for recalls or service bulletins: Some 2009 Malibus had steering-related recalls. You can check with GM or a dealership using your VIN.
• Visit a trusted mechanic familiar with GM EPS systems: Not all shops are equipped to handle electric steering diagnostics properly.


---

⚠️ Why This Matters

Your concern about safety is valid. A malfunctioning EPS system can cause unpredictable steering behavior, especially at low speeds or during turns. If the system overcorrects or fails mid-turn, it could lead to loss of control."

I finally got around to buying and replacing the MAF sensor in my 96’ E36 328is.
Previously with the old MAF sensor I would run about -8 to -11 fuel trims, one day I got a thrown code for fuel trim bank 1 and 2 (P1188 and P1189) respectively, with this I also noticed that when coming to a stop the car would tend to almost stall out and have a really “bouncy” idle (would rev between 100rpm and 900 rpm) until settling down after idling for a bit. 
Now that I have replaced the MAF sensor I no longer get the P1188 and P1189 codes anymore, however my short fuel trims run anywhere from -16 to the highest I’ve seen of -26, and my long fuel trims settling into about -8ish all the time.

As far as I know, you have to drop the tank to see the top of that stuff.   It is no easy task, and one they'd likely not do just for a diagnostic estimate.  I don't know why they'd recommend a new tank if the rodent just chewed some wires.  If it did,  your car would have a ton more problems than just an evap leak, like not being able to start. 

Just so you know, the fuel system is vacuum pressurized to keep the gas fumes from escaping.  If the system detects a vacuum leak, it will throw one of those codes, but not usually both.  You shouldn't have a small and big leak at the same time.  The most common cause of an evap leak is a faulty gas cap.

Bondo is body filler designed for filling small imperfections in solid metal. It's not structural and it's not waterproof. When it's used to fill a rust hole, water gets behind it and the rust continues spreading underneath. Six months later the bondo falls out and the hole is bigger than before. It's a temporary cover up that makes the problem worse.

Rust happens because metal is exposed to moisture and oxygen. Once metal has rusted through completely, that metal is gone. It can't be brought back. The only real fix is cutting out the rusted section and welding in new metal. This requires welding equipment and skills most people don't have.

For surface rust that hasn't eaten through yet, there's a proper process. Grind or sand down to bare metal, treat it with rust converter or encapsulator, prime it immediately, then paint. The key is getting all the rust off. If any rust remains under the filler or paint, it keeps spreading.

The fiberglass mesh method some people use is slightly better than straight bondo but still not a real fix. It might hold longer but water still gets through and rust continues. It's basically a bandaid on a structural problem.

For anyone with rust holes on their car, the options are: learn to weld and do proper metal repair, pay someone to weld in patch panels, or accept that it's a temporary cover up that will fail. There's no magic product that permanently fixes rust holes without welding new metal in.

Small surface rust is totally manageable with proper treatment. But once there are holes, it's past the point of simple fixes. Trying to cheap out with bondo just delays the inevitable and usually makes it cost more to fix properly later.

If the car is worth saving, invest in real rust repair. If it's a beater being driven into the ground, understand that bondo is temporary at best. Just don't fool yourself into thinking it's actually fixed.",23,1760516956.0,31,autorepair,1760643270,2025-10-15 08:29:16,2025-10-16 19:34:30,"Tall-Control8992 (Score: 6): You're supposed to use spray foam, not bondo

Found the slightest bit of crust buildup behind the pulley, but my levels are good and temps are good so I’m gonna hopefully make it to next week when the part comes in, but the tensioner arm is in fact giving up, it’s screechy upon pulling back, and the pulley is spinning too freely. The compressor clutch may have a slight click to it when pushing but it’s barely noticeable if so. But the culprit is mainly looking to be the pump.

I’m not averse to doing my own work, I’ve swapped valve covers, do my diff and trans fluid changes, etc anything I can do without a lift, alignment lift, or compressors etc, I will, but this is going to be the biggest job I’ve taken upon myself yet aside from upgrading/overhauling things like a sound system, deadening, wiring etc. If anyone has any specific knowledge to these cars, and things to look for while I’m in there, or things to be more careful with please let me know, but after about a week of nonstop researching and planning here’s my idea, I’ve got a shop that offered $55 to fully vacuum the ac system, and I plan to drive it back to where I’m working on the car, with the ac off of course, and then get her up, remove the belt, alternator and compressor, and everything else in the way, do my repairs, and then bring it back somewhere to have it recharged.

1o6x5os,2010 Grand Caravan SXT 3.8 will not crank.,"After seeing a similar post to my issue I figured I would post again to see if anyone has answers. I have a 2010 Dodge Grand Caravan SXT. It has the 3.8 engine. A couple of years ago it would intermittently not start. You would turn the key and it would have power but it would begin to turn over and then it would stop. Almost like a hard crank but it would never do a full crank. It got to the point last year where it wouldn’t crank at all anymore. Same issue everytime. I have had multiple mechanics come by and look at it and they couldn’t figure it out either. I have replaced the ignition switch, rekeyed it, put in a new TIPM unit and replaced the starter twice (the first one was bad off the shelf).  I’m truly at a loss. My next move is tow it to an automotive electric shop near me and let them chase whatever ghost is causing this. If anyone can help or has any answers I’ll try just about anything at this point.

1o7rd8y,Transmission Shop Put ATF Instead of CVT Fluid,"Hello everyone! I wanted to get your thoughts on something that happened recently.

I went to a transmission shop and asked them to do a partial fluid change on my 2012 Scion iQ (55,000mil). I even showed them the exact fluid the car requires Toyota CVT Fluid FE. But they ended up filling it with ATF instead of CVT fluid. When I found out, they admitted the mistake and said they would fix it by doing a double flush with the correct OEM Toyota CVT Fluid FE and refill it properly. I drove about 4 miles with ATF before they started the flush.

My question is after this full procedure, will my CVT be safe and works good or could this mistake have caused permanent damage? Has anyone else had a similar experience?

1o7ratj,I feel like they are just trying to scam me. 2017 Volvo s90 T6,"I bought my car used in February. 2 weeks of having it the check engine light came on. I took to the dealership I got it from (not a Volvo dealership) they said they recommend a fuel system cleaning and it’s a cold start misfire that they can only replicate on cold starts. I ran two rounds of Techron through about 2 months apart because the check engine light would go away on its on for a couple weeks after 5 drive cycles and I thought it was the Techron. During this time I was constantly scanning the ecu and it was showing random misfire with a sub code of cylinder 2 misfire. Now it moved to cylinder 3 and 4 for the sub codes but still main code is random misfire. The light went away for a while, mind you this entire time I have ZERO misfire symptoms, no consistent rough idle, no loss of power, or anything like that. I took it to a Volvo dealership and within an hour or two of me dropping the car off they send an estimate for a full fuel injector replacement. When dropping it off I explained that my symptoms line up with being a carbon buildup issue rather than injectors and I’m looking for that so could they do a leak down test, compression test, and see if it’s only replicated on cold starts. 

The service advisor told me the tech only scanned the ecu and did a duty test saying the 3 and 4 failed the duty test. Even though the duty test doesn’t show the root cause it’s just showing that there’s a compensation to opening the injectors, which can be cause by weak airflow from carbon buildup. However they didn’t do any other type of test to confirm the injectors being the issue. This is the conversation I had with him. Am I over reacting or being difficult? They haven’t fully diagnosed it and is going off of experience and I understand I’m not a Volvo tech but if my symptoms don’t point point to injectors, they didn’t fully check it and are trying to charge me $615 for the “extra” test outside of the ecu scan.

Then the top of the dipstick just uses a bolt and holds it in place on the flange. 

If I were to bet, that bolt eventually worked its way loose and the dipstick probably just fell out on the road. 

Now measure your oil level and refill to appropriate. You are certainly lower on oil than you should be and just plugging the hole is probably going to result in the plug being forced out due to blow by, so I don’t really recommend you try to plug it. Nor should you try to thread a bolt into that hole because it’ll never seal correctly with the replacement dipstick - and its $$ to fix that tube. 

To clean the engine , grab some dish soap like dawn, a brush and a garden hose. Or a bucket of warm water depending on how cold it is that day. 
You can do this while the car is running if you want but be careful of the belts, but generally you will drizzle soap everywhere and then spray the car down. Try not to blast things with high pressure water, the connectors and things are old so they’ll not seal as well as it used to. If the car shuts off while you’re doing this, wherever you sprayed water is whats not sealed and needs to be drained and dried. Usually its going to be spark plugs or your distributor/HT system. Otherwise, don’t spray it in the intake, you car doesn’t breath water… and the exhaust is gonna steam up. Once you’re done, let it run for an hour or so, maybe take it for a drive and let things dry off. If all is good, you’re done.  

If you don’t feel like a garden hose, soap and hot water in a spray bottle will also work."

Over the weekend, my dad and I added about **8 quarts of transmission fluid** to my 2014 Hyundai Elantra (125k miles, 11 years old). The car had been showing some **signs of transmission noise** over the past few days, and then it suddenly **stopped moving in Drive**, though Reverse still worked.

We were worried it might be a serious issue, so we topped up the fluid ourselves. Since then, I’ve been driving the car, and I **can hear a slight whine/hum from the transmission** when accelerating.

I also took the car to a mechanic to check everything, and they said the transmission is fine — only a **small leak from the plug**, probably just needed bolts tightened. They didn’t see anything major wrong.

So my question is:

* Is it normal to hear transmission noise **after adding fluid**, especially in an older car like mine?
* How long should it take for the noise to go away?

As soon as i left and got home, i left my car running for 10 minutes since i was going inside to change quickly to go somewhere after. I come back out and my driveway is full of oil, like full. As soon as i noticed…….. i drove back to the shop since I only live two minutes away from it(I probably shouldn’t have) but the people who helped me previously, helped fix my car again. I parked on the side after i was done to make sure it wasn’t leaking anymore. Surely enough, it happens again but this time while still there. They have me pull back around and they work on it again. For the third time, for sure i was reassured i was good to be on my way(i had to drive two hours away) and said i should be all set. I notice there’s a leak before i leave but the mechanic tells me it’s just degreaser, nothing to worry about since it’s not oil. I really had my doubts and kept questioning him but he was insistent on it being degreaser. I get to my bf’s house and have his dad check it out for me- surely enough it was oil still leaking and he recommended I didn’t drive my car no more. I left it there and the next day- the same guys from the shop came over to my bf’s house personally to work on my car. Whatever, assured me again and said all good to go- if it was to happen again give them a call… indeed it happened again but since it was Saturday they were already done for the day. On Monday, they sent out a tow truck to come pick up my car from my house to take it to an auto body shop they recommended(all cost and fees, on them) and yesterday I went to go pick up my car since they said it was ready. Auto shop assured us the car was all set. Apparently there was a plastic inside of the oil filtration system that was broken while somehow getting my oil changed- so they fixed it and sent us on our way- assured us it was that for sure. Well…. Half an hour later my car is leaking, AGAIN. For the 6th time now. I am not sure what to do. Should I go through my own auto shop and have somebody else check it out and send the bill to the shop that initially caused this? Should I go through my insurance or just let them know what’s been going on so they’re aware this isn’t on me?? My car was completely fine before I even took it into the shop!

By cracked plastic, I'm assuming they mean that the oil filter housing is cracked, probably from over tightening the filter cover, and now it's leaking. The ""V"" of the engine can hold nearly a quart of oil before it starts spilling out and down onto the ground.

These oil filter/cooler assemblies are known to fail in this way on all 3.6L Pentastar engines. They are a plastic unit, with a metal oil cooler bolted on the top, and the entire assembly is bolted to the top of the engine. I had a similar thing happen to mine in my 2018 Chrysler Pacifica minivan. In my case, the seal between the oil cooler and the engine deteriorated, leaking oil, rather than cracking. There are several all-aluminum replacement assemblies available that can be installed, that will prevent future issues due to the OEM units being made of plastic. Here's some links below.

I have a manual 2022 peugeot 208 GT line, Has done around 45,000miles.  
I bought it 2nd hand in January so just caught the end of the 3 year warranty period (now expired).

The electrics have always been a little but temperamental, for example:  
\- occasionally stuttering on ignition

\- Sometimes console/ screen would restart whilst driving.

\- ""Auto-dipping headlamp failure"" would ping for a second or so perhaps once an hour when driving

\- Very variable whether the engine would cut for fuel efficency during stand-still (sometimes works for a month or so and then doesn't happen). Occasionally when did cut out would need a full manual restart.

\- AC/ heating sporadically not blowing appropriate temperature. If I turn the car off and on then would usually fix this.

Anyway the ignition stuttering got worse- I just assumed a problem with the battery.

Taken to the garage and they have repaired the wiring around the battery and now seems to have at least fixed the ignition. Haven't driven for long enough to see if other issues are resolved.

The garage said it ""looks like somebody has been working on the car"" and that it looks like the battery has been replaced but in a sloppy way. They said it could be someone privately doing it or could even be a bad job by a garage. Said there was no way to find out if/ why other work has been done on it.

The car was a bit messy when I bought it, cigarette smell/ sticky wrappers and I got the impression the previous owner was a bit chaotic.

Anyway my question is, why would someone be fumbling around with the electronics in a less than 3 year old car? Is there anything that sounds suspicious here? Is there any steps you would take to find out more?

After many long hours of fighting with the ball joint bolt that inevitably needed to be cut off, I was trying to install the new shaft and having barely any strength left to force the knuckle down enough to slide the new shaft in, the new shaft rubbed against the shock tower and ripped the brand new boot. Cue the 5 stages of acceptance.

The tear is only the width of my thumbnail and it’s right up against the larger clamp. I initially covered it with a zip tie cause I only need this car to last one more year (and winter) and I start a new job next Monday. I had to drive around yesterday to get more parts (long story) and it weeped out only a little grease staying off the highways and pulling over to check it regularly.

I did some research and found that Shoe Goo and Flex Seal seems to be a viable option to keep it together. So far I’ve done two coats of the shoe goo, planning on doing a third layer today once it cures. Afterwards I plan on 2 layers of Flex Seal spray just to ease my mind a bit.

Just curious if these efforts are futile, as getting a hold of these shafts is honestly an endeavour in itself with the high cost and availability getting worse each year.",1,1760538900.0,4,AskMechanics,1760643270,2025-10-15 14:35:00,2025-10-16 19:34:30,"2seatersportsvan (Score: 1): https://preview.redd.it/rq253weigavf1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67b2c1a329f51deb4b6f55ec3b09534ab3b9440e

Once removed the inflator is a live explosive but stable, I’m not sure how you’d be best to dispose of it, do not just toss it in the trash.  Best would probably be to secure it to a board, and set it off with a 12v pulse to the pins, then toss it in the trash

I have a 2024 Mazda 3 Turbo and I’m currently experiencing some weird jerkiness in my car at low speeds.

It happens in 1st gear, around 6km/h - 20km/h, after I brake. It feels as if the car is jerking forward and backward in the body (I don’t feel anything in the steering), regardless of whether I’m in Drive or Reverse gear. The weird thing is that it completely goes away when I shut the car off and re-start it. I’ve also realized that the RPM meter doesn’t stay stationary when this happens, it moves in between 600 - 750 RPM. When my foot is on the brake, I can sort of feel some sort of shaking as it tries to stop the car from shaking forward and backwards. The car does stop shaking when I press on the brakes firmly, but as I let go of the brake, the car starts to shake forward and backwards again until I pick up speed above 20km/h. This happens erratically and I’m having a hard time identifying the issues through my research online. Any clue what the issue may be?

1o70vhw,"Have to remove the right cylinder head on 2006 4.0 V6 Mustang after having sparkplug issues. Have some questions, would love to hear from someone who knows more about this than I do.","As of last week, the car ran perfectly fine, no issues whatsoever. Started to hear a ticking noise when in idle or accelerating, but had no noticeable difference in handling or performance, so I didn't think it was a big deal (bad idea, wouldn't do this.) Was on the interstate and car started getting real jumpy whenever I pressed the accelerator, so I pulled over. Had a buddy come save me with an OBD2, and it gave us a code for a misfire on cylinder #4.

So I started simple and went to change the sparkplug. When I popped the hood, the sparkplug was very loose, you could wiggle it with your fingers. Pulled it out and saw that the electrode was bent over on itself. The last owner used a heli-coil kit and had an adapter on the plug, so I went to Autozone and got some new plugs and inserts. Unfortunately, the largest sized inserts the store sold weren't quite big enough for the new threads, so I was kind of out of luck for the time being. So I figured I'd have a go at re-gapping the old sparkplug and putting it back in to see if it'd work as a temporary solution (bad idea, wouldn't do this).

Engine made a sort of crunchy noise when I fired it up so I turned it off and took the plug back out. Electrode was now completely gone. Put a borescope through the plug hole and took a peek in the cylinder, you can see fragments of the electrode all over the cylinder. I think the plug was probably just threaded too far into the head and the piston was hitting it. Thankfully the cylinder walls and piston looked undamaged, and the threads in the sparkplug hole look fine, so I'm gonna try and fix it.

So now I gotta take my head off and get the electrode crumbs out. This is my first time taking a head off of any engine. I've already got a new gasket and head bolts in the car on rockauto, and got torque specs for the head bolts. But is there any general knowledge about this I should know about? Anything to be wary off/careful with? Any common hang-ups or mistakes to avoid? Like I said, first time taking a head off, and I'm pretty new to car maintenance in general, I am a bumbling moron who can't afford a mechanic. So pretend you're teaching your 14 year old son how to take a head off. The biggest thing I'm worried about is messing up the timing chain or camshaft. Is one of those camshaft holders strictly necessary? or can you get by just ziptieing it in place?

The GSR2 is technically in force, but the UK's law overrides it and the Automated Vehicles Act in its current form doesn't outright stipulate that ADAS are a legal requirement in new cars.

So basically to cover their arses, pretty much every manufacturer is just selling cars with EU spec safety systems, which means all ADAS features are hard coded to switch on every time the car is started.

In some models you can set up driver profiles which will turn the features you want on or off with the push of a single button, but at this stage pretty much every manufacturer has them programmed to reset and turn on the next time the car is powered on, so it means using the button every time the car is started. They can't be permanently turned off.

Since Brexit there are a lot of weird legal quirks like this all over the place where post-Brexit UK legislation hasn't caught up to EU directives, so most companies are just following the latest version of whatever law covers their arses the most.

I'd imagine that UK law on ADAS will fall in line with the rest of the EU in the next few years, more than likely.

1o7nr5l,Changing Pads and Discs on a Q5 but I am stuck,"I have a 2010 Q5 2.0 TDI. I figured I would save some money and do the front pads myself. It's not a big job and I am fine doing this on my other smaller car. For the life of me though I cannot get the caliper back on with these pads on. The caliper is TRW and the discs are 320mm. I tried first of all with the existing discs.. couldn't get it back together. I saw the discs were lipped around the edged so probably needed a replacement which I then did but with the new discs.. exact same problem.

I get the pads in the caliper, piston completely withdrawn slip the caliper and pads over the disc but I am about 3mm off on the inward direction from being able to get the caliper back over its mounting points. Is this a normal issue or am I being an idiot in some way?

Worth mentioning too that this isn't a piston issue, there is plenty of room between the pad and the disc on the piston side of the caliper. The far side has no piston - just caliper against bracket - but it doesn't seem to have enough room to fit around the disc. I did search for thinner pads but every one I found was 18.9mm, which seems the standard for these calipers.

These are the pads and discs:

I (not a mechanic) have done loads of brake changes on my A4's of that era (so almost definately the same brakes) and every time the tolerances are tight, but do-able. As the other poster says the most common problem is that the ""ears"" of the pads are too wide to fit into the carrier and need to be ground down.

If this is the problem then yes, the pads can stick out too much and prevent installation. ~~If you aren't sure then remove the anti-squeal shims and try that. If they fit fine without the shims then that's the problem. Regardless, if they need a lot of force to install into the carrier (due to the tolerances being too tight) then you'd be wise to grind them back regardless. They'll only get tighter over time until they potentially become stuck. Been there, done that.~~

~~Aside from that maybe check all the shims are correctly installed, free from corrosion and not bent or deformed. They are fragile and can be distorted if you aren't careful. ECP sell the shims.~~

It's about time she goes away for the winter so I am going to SORN her.

I was wondering whether it would be worthwhile keeping the insurance going (it was £350 for the year) or whether to cancel it (refund would be £135, as admiral take £60 as a fee).

As far as I can tell, they don't offer a ""laid up"" option that I could change the policy to or anything like that, otherwise that would have been the best option.

So I think my only options are £135 cash, or keep the insurance going and start building the no claims discount, essentially costing me £135 for one year of NCD - I do know that the NCD isn't really impactful though, I checked a few times on different vehicles and 10 years NCD made a very small difference if any. On top of course if you do ever have to claim, you lose it, so I don't really think it's worth building the NCD in this costly way.

I recently moved in with my girlfriend and her family 7 hours away from my hometown. I took a seasonal job and bought my first car there, however, plan to move back to my hometown after my contract is finished at the end of November. 

I took out provisional insurance with Sterling. I put down my temporary address as I was told to by the Customer Service representative. After I paid for the insurance, they asked me to provide a proof of address. As i’m moving back to my hometown, I haven’t changed many of my addresses. Sterling asked for proof of address, for which I provided my work pay slip (the only thing with my temporary address on it). 

This wasn’t enough apparently. Even after an hour long phone call, the customer service representative basically told me it would have to be cancelled. Now all my premiums are 3x more expensive when I put that I had my insurance cancelled. I was wondering that since I still paid, and it wasn’t really all my fault the insurance cancelled, do I need to declare it?

What you ultimately need to ask for, is what standard of proof was required, what did they actually ask for.

The fact your driver's license isn't at that address isn't a matter for insurance, it's a regulatory issue.

This is vague as there are a lot of suspension components but basically you can't have severe rust within 30cm of suspension. This is likely just surface rust, you can do some preventative maintenance (wire brush + rust converter + paint/wax treatment)... or you just ignore it until it becomes a fail and replace the component then. Really depends on _what_ is rusty though.

Anti-roll bar bushes or drop links are wear items so they've probably noticed it's starting to go so should be replaced. You'll hear knocking when going over bumps, or have looser steering when they fail. 

These are inexpensive and quick to replace, so shouldn't cost too much. You can safely leave this until you hear knocking though.

My Passat has a 6spd, so I can't comment on the 5spd but I would think being a diesel it wouldn't be revving that high when cruising on the motorway. My 6spd sits ~2000rpm@70mph so I would imagine the 5spd is ~2200-2300@70mph

I believe there might be some early Mk7.5 registered in 2016, which would be under the old VED rates. My 2016 Passat is £20/year tax and is equipped similarly to a Mk7.5.

I think its worth looking at Seat and Skoda's offering too, as fundamentally the Leon and Octavia are the same car as the Golf. Also the Passat and Superb are built on the same platform, and as diesel saloon cars are quite unpopular nowadays can represent quite good value."

Push harder for a courtesy car, explain your need for a vehicle and suggest you will go through insurance or look to recoup costs of your own rental if they are not forthcoming.

After taking the car in, I get a call saying it’s failed it’s MOT because the two rear indicator bulbs are too pale and need replacing. I said okay i’m happy to replace those. The guy then went on to list a lot of work that needed doing on the car including spark plugs, the air vent and most significantly the timing belt, given the cars age. He told me this work was going to cost around £1000; I authorise this as I was under the impression this would fix all issues with the car. Nowhere did he mention any other issues with the car regarding the MOT other than the fail on the bulbs.

I then pick my car up and ask for a print out of the report. It’s not until I get home that I realise he hasn’t issued me with a fail MOT certificate/print out which my partner has had previously from the same garage. Even more oddly, he hasn’t issued me with a pass MOT certificate given I was under the impression that changing the indicator bulbs would mean that he would then pass the car.

I look on the gov.uk website to find that under the fail MOT there are five advisories that I was not informed of by the garage, including all coil springs corroded, corrosion to the car body itself, an irreparable puncture in my tyre and front near side brake disc corrosion. 

So I’ve spent £1k on the car which didn’t even fix the advisories I wasn’t informed of - if I knew I might not have even authorised the charges - and he’s let me drive away with a puncture in my tyre I was not informed of, and I have no MOT pass.

In terms of petrol vs diesel, it depends on your driving habits. Will you be using it for regular short commutes (less than 15 miles/ 20 mins), where petrol would be preferential or will you be doing a lot of miles on the motorway often (diesel preferred).

CatFather93 (Score: 2): Worth noting there may be a difference in insurance costs between the two also

I purchased a 3.0TDi A5, (slightly different fish I know) when I was shopping around and doing insurance quotes the insurance on the S-line was 2x, sometimes 3x more expensive than the SE model

I got lucky however and managed to find a SE that the original buyer had paid for all the options that would be included in the S-line model (still have the original purchase receipt) 
So I essentially have a S-line spec, SE model

Unsure if it works the same with the Q5 
But figured I'd mention it so you don't get a shock when it comes to insurance 

Insurance for me at 32 with 9 years no claims is £560 for the year with mods declared 

Where as the S-line was being quoted at £1500+

Just thought I'd add, that my sister in law has the 2.0tdi Q5 with the DSG box
There is an inherent issue with a certain generation of DSG box where you can develop severe rattle in the flywheel.

I would personally recommend that people looking at buying a Q5 depending on the driving style they do to avoid getting the 2.0tdi and instead go for the 3.0tdi
It may be slightly more expensive in the tax rate..
But because of the weight of the car, the 3.0tdi is actually more economical to drive because it doesn't have to work as hard to move the weight of the car itself

There is numerous posts on audi forums specifically talking about how much more economical the 3.0tdi can be in comparison to the 2.0tdis.
But it's all personal preference really."

1o6wecx,Insurance for bigger car at 21,I was looking for a new car after driving a fiesta for around 2 years now and as I was looking for new cars I stumbled across that A4 bmw 3series 2007-2010 are more expensive to insure rather than a w211 or a passat b6-b7. How is this the case? Like 1.9tdi a3 is more expensive then a e270. Is this a loophole or are the quotas right since i used all my answers and used my current car to check and the insurance was basically the same so the answers I gave are correct and they are the same answers for every model in the quota. I did put my parents as additional drivers and myself as main even tho up till now I was only as second driver to my fiesta. Does anyone recommend any other cars that will have cheaper insurance for a younger driver? If I can get away with a sedan or estate with cheap insurance I will go for it.,0,1760487526.0,13,CartalkUK,1760643270,2025-10-15 00:18:46,2025-10-16 19:34:30,"Beneficial-Drink-998 (Score: 1): Assuming your employed try the money supermarket job picker you would be surprised how much of a difference that can make I did it and took over £400 off my insurance just make sure the title still somewhat relates to your job and can be realistically tied to your current position.

PrinceRicard (Score: 1): Common things are more expensive as they're common and often smashed up, that or they attract certain folk, Audi, BMW - draw the conclusion yourself.

Odd or rarer things can often be cheaper as they expect people to take care of a rarer car.

Try some Volvos out, maybe a Saab estate - anything you think might be driven by a 'boring' person.

Ziemniok_UwU (Score: 1): Insurance is mostly statistic based. The typical driver that attracts a BMW or Audi is statistically more of a bellend and drives like one too so is more likely to have an accident.

For cheap insurance you want to avoid anything that appeals to young people so find yourself a boring dad car like a Toyota or Volvo."

I’ve heard some things about these engines and they could go wrong but also a lot of good things about the power & performance of them. I would just like some quality information to clear my worries about this potential purchase as I really like the car but don’t want to be burnt in the future if anything goes wrong as they’re not the cheapest things to replace.",0,1760486873.0,1,CartalkUK,1760643270,2025-10-15 00:07:53,2025-10-16 19:34:30,"Ziemniok_UwU (Score: 1): The engines are fine. They will never be as reliable as naturally aspirated engines which is why you sometimes hear people with issues but overall they are good.

They are powerful for what they are but if you car about performance then you are looking at the wrong car. A 1L turbo is fine for the city but on motorways it leaves a lot to be desired."
