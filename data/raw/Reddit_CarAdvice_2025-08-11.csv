1mmy1s4,Physical Key Only Works Half of the Time Unlocking Door,"Super funny story. 

I drive an 06 Honda Odyssey, about 235k miles. Love the van but it's falling apart in small ways. The other day I stopped at a store, and when I came back out, my key wouldn't go in the lock at all. As if it were completely the wrong key. And if you did manage to get it inside, it definitely wouldn't budge at all. 

Called a locksmith, they came out and got inside, but my key still wasn't working for the lock at all. Started the van just fine still. 

Locksmith coded a new key right then & there. It worked, maybe twice. The replacement key also struggles, but maybe like 2 times outta 10 unlocking the door so as long as you take it slow, it works. 

Any clue on what the heck happened? I figure i need to get it to a pro for sure, but was hoping to get a point in the right direction.

1mmxs12,My 2007 Ford Escape feels like it starts fighting its brakes after half an hour or so of driving >60,"Hey all, my car (2007 Ford Escape XLT 6.0L) has been having really weird symptoms that nobody has been able to diagnose & I figured it was high time to ask the internet for help. I think the problem is with my brakes, or possibly the alignment, but I don't really know anything, and the thing is that I already just had my brakes & rotors done to try to solve the issue. It has gotten slightly better in some ways but the biggest problems are still present & my brakes guy doesnt know what's going on. I will try to explain the symptoms as best I know how in the hopes that you wonderful geniuses will know what's up.

Basically, it feels like my car starts fighting itself after driving it for long enough (sooner at higher speeds). When it first starts, it feels like I am slightly pressing the brake all the time, such that the vehicle no longer moves slowly forward from stopped when no pedals are pressed while in drive. Over time it gets worse to where the vehicle feels very lurchy, as if the wheels are suddenly a little bit square, if that makes any sense. Once or twice it has gotten bad enough that it started making very unpleasant metal scraping sounds and once stopped would only move VERY slowly such that even parking was an unnerving challenge.

My brakes guy replaced all my brakes & rotors plus one front caliper that was bad, but all that did was make the brakes stop squealing. He isn't sure what's going on and so far all he has been able to point out is that one of the rear caliper mounts seems to have dents in it that may be preventing something from releasing properly. I have no idea if that makes any sense so, you guys be the judges. I reallly need this fixed so I will be watching this thread closely to answer any questions or perform tests if needed. Thank you all in advance.

EDIT: It might be important to mention that the vehicle always feels like it pulls slightly to the right while braking, and in fact even while driving the steering wheel is very slightly misaligned, like it has to be about 2 or 3 degrees to the right (clockwise) to drive in a straight line. Additionally, any time I am going over around 70mph (or slower if going uphill), the steering wheel has subtle but definitely there, intermittent shakes back and forth. It will shake a little for a few seconds, then stop shaking, then start again and so forth until I slow down. It does this always, even if the ""sticking"" issue hasn't started to manifest yet. I don't know if any of that could be related.",1,1754869388.0,4,MechanicAdvice,1754940980,2025-08-10 23:43:08,2025-08-11 19:36:20,"Vic_Pirelli (Score: 1): Have your brakes guy check the brake hoses on the front.  When the hoses age and internally delaminate, they can act as a one way valve.  Brake goes on when pressed, doesn't go off when released.  The brakes may function normally when they are cold and get worse as they warm up.

I've seen this a lot on Escapes and other Fords from around those model years, and always the front hoses.  Maybe the rears can do it too, but I've not seen that happen.

The solution is to replace both front hoses, and of course, bleed the brakes after the replacement."

Last week, I was replacing the intermediate steering shaft, and right after I jacked it up and took off the left front tire, I saw coolant start to leak out pretty fast on the right side in the area of the water pump (it was dripping right over where the right output shaft would be--at first I thought I blew the seal before I saw it was clearly Dex-Cool, not ATF). It lost enough coolant that I had to fill up the expansion tank most of the way. 

By the time I finished the job and went to inspect the leak, it had stopped completely. I've gotten it up to temp and driven it multiple times with no issues whatsoever.

I don't know if the leak was pure coincidence, or if the vibration from the impact wrench did something (I wouldn't think it would be any more than normal road forces). And no, I didn't jack it up by the radiator or anything lol. But now I'm not really sure what to do. 

I strongly suspect it's the water pump, but until I can see coolant actually dripping out the weephole, I'm reluctant to go replacing it. Of course, now I'm kicking myself for not replacing it when I did my head gasket last summer 😅.

The light no longer comes on, is this issue fixed or should I still be concerned there is an issue with the battery? Is it true the battery flattened just because I wasn't driving enough?

If you're in the US get one of the shops to to a battery test on it, I think they do them for free. Or buy a battery tester on amazon for $20 and follow a YouTube video on how to do it, it's very simple.

SpitefulMechanic351 (Score: 1): ""Dark current"" can cause a battery to fail if a vehicle isn't driven very much.  The term ""dark current"" refers to the minute amount of electrical energy that is used to keep things like clocks accurate, radio stations remembered, driver seating positions remembered (if your car has electric seats and has push-button settings for different drivers), what phones are paired to the Bluetooth, any sort of adaptive engine/transmission stuff that the car may do on it's own, that sort of thing.

If the battery has never been changed it might be simply worn out.  Easy way to tell if the battery has been changed is to simply look at it and see what brand name is there.  If it says ""Citroen"" or whatever the name of Citroen's in-house parts brand is (Ford calls it's parts brand Motorcraft, Gm calls theirs AC Delco for example), then it might be the original battery and after 10 years should probably be replaced.

However, let's presume that the battery has been replaced in the past and is less than 5 years old (which is a normal lifespan for a car battery).  If the car is going to spend a lot of time just sitting instead of being driven, getting a battery tender might be a good idea.  A battery tender is a little device that can either be clipped to the battery terminals when the car is parked and then plugged into the wall, or it can be wired directly to the battery cables.  There are also solar-powered ones that may or may not work for you depending on how much sunlight is available where you generally park your car.

When I say battery tender I'm talking about this sort of device https://www.amazon.com/Battery-Tender-021-0128-Maintain-Damaging/dp/B00068XCQU, but I'm not specifically endorsing this particular one.  I had a similar one on my motorcycle that worked for several years before a lightning strike to the building fried it."

Sometimes Subaru's won't bleed their cooling systems correctly if all 4 wheels are on the ground.  It should be noted that you should have the heater on full-blast during this process to make sure that you get the air out of the heater core.

Alternately, if you've got access to an air compressor and a tool called an AirLift, or some other vacuum cooling system refilling tool, you could drain the coolant into a clean container, put the entire cooling system under vacuum and refill it that way.

Then using the timing indicator for the damper pulley rotate the engine to 0 degrees.

Now look at the distributor gear and the location for #1 cylinder on the distributor cap. The rotor should be positioned slightly before it points to the #1 cylinder. As you drop the distributor, it should start moving towards the #1 position and stop short as the distributor stops dropping into the engine. Now you need a second person to bump the starter as you hold down on the distributor body and when the distributor shaft lines up with the oil pump drive, the distributor will drop the rest of the way in.

With the damper on there's a top dead center mark that lines up with the timing cover. Set that with the valves closed, bump engine until compression air starts to come out then finish lining it up by hand. Then check distributor rotor alignment at the 8 mark on the distributor base. Really good to double check."

By that I mean, take the door panel off and unplug the window motor.  It should only have two wires going into it.  Let's pretend, for sake of this explanation, that the motor has 1 red wire and 1 black wire going into it (your actual colors may vary, I don't have a wiring schematic for your vehicle) and that when you're looking at the connector with the locking tab on top the red wire is on the left.  Remove both wires from the connector and put the wires back so that the red wire is on the right and then plug it back in.  The window should work the same as the others meaning that pushing the switch up should make the window go up.

Let's pretend that you're not comfortable re-pinning a connector.  Using the above example, you could simply cut the wires several inches away from the plug and splice them back together (using butt connectors or solder/heat shrink) connecting the red wire on the plug side to the black wire on the harness side.

1mmphgm,Car battery confirmation,"Took my car ('10 Mustang GT) to a new mechanic  on a recommendation. Did a really good job fixing what needed to be fixed. Idk if it was overpriced or if he fixed more than he needed to or did exactly what needed to be done at a great price - no assumptions one way or the other.

Anyway he said my battery was ""very weak"". I have replaced my battery before (as well as starter, struts) so I told him I'll handle that figuring I could do that for less than the $350 he quoted for the battery replacement (that seemed pretty high even with labor rates included).

First, I tested with a multimeter. Researched a few sites and tested cold, during crank and then post-crank a few seconds after. 

I got 12.54, 9.87 and 14.36. (Also did wife's ('14 Mustang GT) and got 12.28, 10.7, 14.24. 

From what I have read my battery (and her's) obviously isn't optimal but doesn't seem like it falls in the very weak category either from what I have gleaned. 

So is my battery ""very weak"" immediate replacement needed or was the mechanic being a little too conservative?  Or is my multimeter test an ok approximation but what a mechanic has is more substantial and gives a better picture?

1mmojil,Brake Trouble 07 Silverado 1500,"So I bought an 07 Silverado 1500 with the 5.3 vortec. Not surprisingly the steel brake lines rusted through so I replaced them all with the AGS NiCopp lines. After installing couldn’t get fluid to the rear brakes (front are disks rear is drums) when attempting to bleed. Performed an ABS bleed with a scanner and then was able to get fluid to rears. Fully bled all the brakes but they were still squishy. After doing some reading I bled the master cylinder yesterday followed by fully bleeding the lines. Brakes are slightly better but still squishy and now make a strange noise. (See video)

I believe brake booster is good due to brakes being firm when motor is not running, then get soft when motor starts. Also can feel brake pedal sink when engine starts and booster kicks on.

The bleeder screws on the rear drums are a pain to get at and is nearly impossible to fit a hose over the nipple while having a wrench on the fitting to tighten or loosen it. This leads to having to remove hose from bleeder screw and possible air entry? 

Don’t have a ton of experience with brakes so am just trying to troubleshoot this. Any advice helps. Thanks!

I’m video I first step on brakes when going about 10mph and then it makes the sound. I then show how soft they are with the engine on. Then I kill the motor to show how they get firm when it’s off, then start engine to show pedal sinking (booster engage)

1mmoa2d,Guess my Turbo has whistled for the last time,"I bought a Golf MK5 1.4 TSI 2008 140hk the other week.

The car runs fairly well, though I felt the turbo was laggy after a few days and I also noticed some light smoke from the exhaust at the same time. Though the more I drove, the more often I got the grey/blue smoke.

Yesterday, the engine light popped on, so I hauled out the OBD scanner and found it was a fault with the O2 sensor. I checked the O2 sensor today and it was far away from clean, see here: [https://ibb.co/21rZcS0Y](https://ibb.co/21rZcS0Y)

So I did what anyone would, I removed the air intake to the turbo and checked the CHRA, and there was my answer. CHRA is in poor condition and is leaking oil. All the oil must clog up the O2 sensor and causing the grey/blue smoke.

  
So, to my question.  


1. Can I replace the CHRA with an aftermarket alternative, but still using the remainder of the turbo parts? Will of course replace all gaskets and bolts. I'm looking at an aftermarket alternative from Meat & Doria [https://www.autodoc.se/meat-doria/7758325](https://www.autodoc.se/meat-doria/7758325) . The only reason to why I want to replace the CHRA instead of the whole turbo is because it's a fraction of the price.
2. I've looked at a few youtube videos on how to do this, and it seems rather straight forward. I'm no mechanic but I've done various 'mechanic things' throughout the years and I'm usually able to fix anything myself. However, I've never touched a turbocharger before.

1mmpqwm,Car regulator/motor troubleshooting - 2000 Carmy,"I have a 2000 Camry that is still going strong mechanically, so I keep making small repairs when needed.

The passenger side window recently stopped going up and down. Generally, it would go down but not up, I'd wait a day, and then it would let me roll it up, but then it stopped working all together.

Last year when the same thing happened on my drivers side, I replaced the regulator & motor, but since then the window has never lined up quite right no matter what I did. I've read that often you can reuse the regulators, and that the newly manufactured ones can cause this kind of not-lined-up issue, so this time I decided to try to swap out the motor but reuse the regulator. 

I put a lot of grease on the old regulator and made sure it moved smoothly. I attached the new motor to it, re-installed it, hooked everything up, and tried the switch. It moved down, but then would not move up. This is the case with both the master (drivers side) switch and the passenger door switch. I can't move it up manually. I sometimes hear a clicking noise when pressing the switch. 

What could be wrong at this point? I had assumed that if I could get the regulator to move freely when it's out of the car, it's working fine. Is that not true? Or is it possibly some kind of wiring issue, even though neither switch works? Left to my own devices I would probably try buying a new regulator assembly and installing that, but that's an additional $100+, I'm not sure it will work, and if it's manufactured poorly like the one I got for my drivers side, the window won't line up, which is annoying.

Car has recently been making a lot of clunking/vibrating noises when driving on dirt/bumpy roads. Did some troubleshooting and think I found the issue. 

Not sure what part this is but believe it’s related to a control arm? Regardless - looks like the two threaded bolts attaching to frame came loose. When I found it the piece had been sitting on the CV axle but I was able to push it back into its proper position. -hence why I believe this is the cause. My questions:

1) for a quick solve - anyone know the size of these bolts so I can grab some and reattach to the frame?
2) knowing this happened - what issues could this create, and what should I be concerned with and/or start looking at replacing?
3) if anything needs replacing - how difficult for someone to do the work themselves? I’ve replaced my front CV axles, am generally pretty handy and tool savvy and like DIY. If I can save some $$ on service fees that’d be great

When it's running, hold a mirror to the tailpipe and see if it fogs the glass. If it does, coolant is getting into your oil, and probably getting oil into your coolant. 

Find out if it's leaking from the timing chain cover, as well as the water pump.

You probably need to fix (replace) your water pump, drain and replace coolant, drain and replace the oil, and the oil filter. 

If you're still losing coolant after that, you might have a blown  head gasket, possibly a cracked head.

Good luck.

Most ""cold air intakes"" basically do nothing. You aren't getting enough extra airflow that the PCM (computer) can't compensate for it

It shouldn't, but if you change the size of the MAF tube without re-programming the PCM it can cause issues with how the car runs/idles. May even send it into limp mode. But if you aren't messing with the MAF tubing, it shouldn't cause any issues"

Switching to power mode could’ve bypassed the issue because the combustion engine and transmission control systems get full priority power.

It’s worth getting the 12V battery checked just to rule it out, but from my experience, if the problem goes away after running for a bit, it’s likely a heat-related voltage drop and not a major transmission fault. Still, for peace of mind, especially if you’re planning hillside drives, it’s best to have your dealer run diagnostics so you’re not stuck somewhere remote. They're really efficient anyway."
1mmmuv8,Electrical System Issues: Battery or Something Deeper,"Vehicle: 2015 GMC Terrain
Mileage: 128810
TL;DR: What started with a warning that blind spot alerts needed service to now the display flashing and setting off alerts. Is this a battery issue or deeper electrical system issues? 


Approximately two weeks ago, I had an alert pop up saying blind spot monitoring needed servicing. A bummer, but not the end of the world and I figured I can wait until I have a bit more cash to bring it in to be fixed. 

Fast forward to last week: the air conditioner would sporadically stop blowing and the display would seem to lose and regain power (the video gives an example of this). Also, turn signals will either not start when engaged or blink once and shut off or freeze and then shut off. 

This morning when going to drive: battery is completely dead. I get it jumped, drive for about 30 minutes and at first it seems everything is back to normal. At about the 20 minute mark, I start having the same issue. 

My question is whether this means the battery is no longer taking a charge or could this be an alternator issue?

Never had an issue again or even a symptom while we kept an eye on it for the next 24 hours. (Also, this is all new with no prior symptoms)

On a 2007 Nissan Xterra, the factory Nissan Vehicle Immobilizer System (NVIS) will cut power to the fuel system — specifically disabling the fuel pump relay — if it doesn’t detect the correct transponder key signal.

When the immobilizer is active:
	•	The starter may crank (or in some cases be disabled, depending on wiring), but
	•	The ECM will prevent fuel pump operation and injector pulsing, so the engine won’t start.

This is why if the immobilizer light is flashing and you try to start it, it will turn over but not fire.

If you’re troubleshooting a no-start issue, it’s important to confirm whether the problem is:
	1.	Key/immobilizer related (look for the security light behavior)
	2.	Fuel pump circuit failure (relay, fuse, wiring, pump)
	3.	Other ECM inputs (like crankshaft position sensor)."

The 1st one was ""regular"" tight. Had to use some grunt and it broke loose. A nice shot of PB Blaster on all the bolts too.

2nd and 3rd bolts I went up the chain. Big box end, 1/2"" ratchet, breaker bar, BF hammer and a box end finally got them.

4th bolt I started with the wrench and hammer. The wrench broke around 5/8 up the handle. I cleaned it up and welded the box end into the open end and got back to smacking the shit out of it with the BF hammer. It broke closer to the box end so it was done for.

I ran out and got a 1500ft pound rattle gun. It doesn't do anything but shake the dirt off the bottom of my car.

Grabbed a 4' pipe, welded a box end to the end and gave that a try. It just flexed the suspension enough that the pipe hits the floor before it breaks loose.

A ""normal"" bolt would have twisted the head off. these are brand new looking ARP bolts. I got this car from my dad who bought off a guy a few years ago. Never driven in bad weather, and these bolts are rust free, clean, 12pt ARP bolts.

I am at a loss.

After installing couldn’t get fluid to the rear brakes (front are disks rear is drums) when attempting to bleed. Performed an ABS bleed with a scanner and then was able to get fluid to rears. Fully bled all the brakes but they were still squishy. After doing some reading I bled the master cylinder yesterday followed by fully bleeding the lines. Brakes are slightly better but still squishy and now make a strange noise. (See video)

I believe brake booster is good due to brakes being firm when motor is not running, then get soft when motor starts. Also can feel brake pedal sink when engine starts and booster kicks on.

The bleeder screws on the rear drums are a pain to get at and is nearly impossible to fit a hose over the nipple while having a wrench on the fitting to tighten or loosen it. This leads to having to remove hose from bleeder screw and possible air entry?

1mm7mqw,What would you guys do in this situation?,"Hi guys, not sure if this is the right place to ask but I am looking for some advice. Just bought my first car yesterday,from a co worker. The car had just gone through a safety inspection (mandatory in Ontario before purchasing /selling a car). and spent a week at the mechanic to get everything up to road safety standards  in Ontario( replaced the windshield, gaskets,tie rods,muffler shield etc.) I took it for a test drive, everything sounded good and I purchased it the day it was done at the mechanic shop

When driving the car home I found that the car was getting significantly louder when accelerating, coming from the muffler. I checked it and found it was super rusted and decided to drive home to get a better look at it after. During that drive home the muffler detached from the exhaust pipe (??) due to the rust and it almost took my back bumper off the same day it came out of the mechanic shop. Long story short I told my co worker about the situation  and she said she would contact the mechanic who did the safety inspection and ask about it. I’m not really sure where to go from here, is there  mechanic liable for not telling the seller about the rusted muffler during the week long inspection ? Is there anything that can/should be done about this ? Do I just suck it up and go pay for a 800$ muffler replacement or ask the seller for some compensation ? What would you guys do in this situation?


I got a second opinion from another mobile mechanic and sent him photos of the muffler /pipe and he stated that the car should not have passed the safety inspection .

Few months ago a lifter turned in the tray and took out the cam, so I changed the cam, the lifters, trays, oil pump, timing chain and tensioner, VLOM, and a few other small things.

There were zero ticks before, and I’m lost as to why with all the new parts, it’s now ticking so loud like this. I’ve pulled the valve covers and rechecked the rockers, everything looks good, no loose bolts on the exhaust manifold, nothing I can see visually to locate it. Curious if anyone can tell by the sound what it would be. I’m really hoping it’s not a bad lifter and something simple I’m overlooking.

posted yesterday night (copy pasted below) about how my car would not turn on at all, and received a couple of comments from some helpful people about how the battery most likely went flat. 

today morning, the car still was not working at all. i could only schedule a servicing with my regular mechanic for Monday, so the car had just been sitting at the same exact spot. 

another person was cleaning the interiors, and probably accidentally switched on one of the interior overhead lights, but it didn't actually turn on so it went unnoticed by then. 

however when I went out tonight, I noticed the interior light had turned on, so immediately went to check on it. somehow on its own, everything was working just fine, the car was driving well, all the lights sounds and displays were working. the clock displayed the time to be around 5am, so that's probably when the battery died yesterday? 

the only thing that could be noticed was there was a very slight buzzing noise when the car was turned on. 

im not sure how this would happen, as a completely flat battery wouldn't likely just recharge on its own just sitting with no external factors? 
would that indicate the issue to lie with the wiring/alternator instead?

However, about 3 days after installing the new battery, I started getting the same “Battery Saver Active” message again.

Here’s what I’ve observed:
	•	When I start the engine, the voltage goes to 14.3V (as shown in the second image, vehicle in park), so I don’t think it’s the alternator.
	•	When the car is in accessory mode (ignition on but engine off), it shows 12.6V and the voltage drops quickly.

Extra details:
	•	Since installing the new battery, I’ve driven the car only about 4 times, ~40 km each trip, and not at high speeds.
	•	During the battery replacement, they connected an auxiliary battery to the front to avoid resetting the system.

*To get started, I am not a mechanic, but I do like to tinker. I had a reliable mobile mechanic put in the new pump since that didn't sound like a fun afternoon for me.*

About a month ago, the fuel pump in my 2003 P74 went to the big junkyard in the sky. One day it just didn't prime and never primed again. I did the usual diagnostic things (check fuse, check relay, check inertia switch, etc) and process of elimination left the pump and the module. I was planning on doing the pump regardless for future preventative maintenance.

Now she has a new Delphi pump (as well as a brand new battery, charged, with freshly cleaned terminals), and there's the sweet sound of it priming every time I turn the key. So, after the install, I primed it a few times and fired it up.

And it started! Glorious day. Engine ran for about 2-3 minutes, just enough time for me to get in. Literally the moment I shut the door, she dies.

Now, all I get is a solid crank but it's not turning over.

Out of the three things needed to start (spark, fuel, air), I'm guessing this is still a fuel thing just given the recent fix, but I'm not sure exactly what the best approach to diagnosing it is. I also ran it for 10s in clear flood mode (pedal to the floor, start attempt), primed it a handful of times, and tried again, but same result.

So today, I hooked up Forscan and pulled some fuel-related data, and now I think it definitely seems like a fuel supply issue to my non-mechanic brain.

https://imgur.com/a/vNqylBn

No related hidden DTCs, but if this is accurate, the pressure at the rail ranges from 2.3-5.3 kPa (so, less than 1 psi), which seems way too low, so obviously no fuel at rail = no start. I'm also seeing a big 0 across the board with fuel tank pressure - not sure if that's the sensor itself, but FTP_F displays ""no fault.""

So...

* Fuel pump module?
* New pump went bad despite still priming?
* Issue in the fuel line or with the filter?
* Tank pressure sensor? Would that affect the actual delivery or just throw a code?

Any diagnostic wisdom at this point would be really appreciated. I have the mobile mechanic coming back out tomorrow to take a look if I can't get it figured out, but if it's something I can do myself I definitely want to do it myself.

1mmvtxz,Is this $3k+ car repair quote reasonable for a minor parking scratch? Need expert opinion.,"Hi all,

I’m looking for some expert advice because I feel stuck in a frustrating situation.

A few months ago, while parking at very low speed, I lightly scraped another car’s **left rear wheel arch**. It left only a **minor surface scratch** — no dents, no deformation, no visible structural damage. The **right-hand side, wheels, and mudflaps were untouched**.

I couldn’t find the owner at the time, so I did the honest thing: left a note with my details.

Fast forward — they’ve lodged a claim and I’ve received two quotes:

* First: **over $3,600**
* Updated: **just over $3,000**

Here’s my issue:  
The quote includes repairs and replacements for areas **not related to the actual scratch** — including the opposite side of the vehicle, wheel/tire replacement, and paintwork far beyond the scratched panel.

From a mechanical and technical point of view, there’s no way a slow, gentle parking scrape could cause this level of “damage” or require such wide-ranging repairs. The incident was highly localized, and the attached photo clearly shows that.

My concerns:

* Scope of work covers **unrelated areas**
* Possible inclusion of **pre-existing damage**
* No evidence of **hidden/internal damage**
* Paint blending far beyond what’s needed
* Repair scope seems **disproportionate to actual damage**

I believe I should pay to restore the car to its **pre-incident condition**, but only for the **actual damage I caused** — not unrelated issues.

Am I being unreasonable to push back on this $3k+ quote?  
What’s the standard practice for situations like this in the industry?  
Would a fair repair just involve fixing and repainting the affected wheel arch?

Brown - on small post and leads into engine harness but can't find where it ends. 

Purple/red - originally was on same post as brown, but leads to safety disconnect switch (a switch that you can hook to the driver and if they fall out of the boat it cuts power), which then leads to ""ON"" position on key switch. 

Red large wires - go to battery and starter

Large yellow/red wire - go to starter

Large purple - on same large post as the large yellow and red wire and goes to some relay

--------------------

 I used a multimeter and realized that in the key switch ON position, we were getting 12V to both small posts and 12V to the large battery post. I was confused why we had 12V at both small posts and it wasn't cranking, and I assumed one of the small posts should be a ground and the ignition wire should be 12 only when ignition is trying to crank. I removed the small purple/red wire and brown wire from the small post. Brown is not connected to power or ground, but strangely I found that purple has 12V. Since I assumed this side of the solenoid should be a ground, I disconnect both brown and purple/red and ran a new wire directly to battery negative and the engine cranks and fires fine, but then won't stay running. I assume that's because the purple/red wire is what is supposed to run fuel injectors, etc and keep the boat running, since it eventually runs back to the key switch ON position. But I don't know why the 12V purple/red wire would be on the same post that should be a ground to get a voltage differential across the solenoid when cranking. I assume this wire is either in the wrong location, or it's supposed to be a ground wire and I have a short to power somewhere. But if it's supposed to be a ground, why would it be routed to the key switch on position? Already replaced most components like neutral safety switch, solenoid, etc. now it just seems like the purple/red wire has an issue or is routed wrong. As a side note, the ignition wire is on the post labeled ""S"" and the brown and the purple/red is on the post labeled ""I"". Is the ground through the base or a small post on these solenoids?

For engines with a distributor and a coil with 4 terminal starter solenoids - One of the small terminals is the start signal in, and the other is power out to the coil while cranking, because the coil may lose power when the switch is in the crank position. 

That sounds like what you have here, and the safety switch essentially sends +/- back to the coil, to defeat the +/-, and kill the engine. 

That all makes sense for a grounded, non insulated ""starter"" solenoid...

Did this fire up and run before?

Since mid-May, I've occasionally come out to find my car battery dead. Thought it was the battery at first, so I replaced it. It kept happening. 

Took it for a diagnosis at Autozone after the battery died again. Battery, alternator, and starter all checked out fine. The computer showed a couple error codes (61-11 ""Modulator-Control Unit Power Source Circuit (IG) Low Voltage"" and 83-14 ""Electric Parking Brake System Malfunction""), but I THINK those were because the system lost power, not the actual cause of the issue.

Took it to the dealership and after a week they said it needed a new On/Off switch and door jam switch for the driver's door, which I told them to go ahead with. 

Four days after picking it up I drove it to the store, TURNED IT OFF, and was getting ready to go into the store when suddenly what's happening in the video starts happening. It's like the car is trying to start itself and I think this is what's been happening the whole time.

Took it back to the dealership, showed them the video, and they kept it for another 2 weeks. Checked the battery, alternator, and starter (still good), and ""reset the system"". Said they didn't have any issues with it after that and I could come pick it up. That was 3 days ago.

It’s louder if I shift quickly, and almost gone when shifting between Reverse, Neutral, and Drive. And the car has always ever so slightly vibrated while idling. Don’t know if it did while driving can’t feel anything tbh. 

So I did some testing myself:
	•	With the car parked, handbrake on, engine running in Park, I lightly revved the engine while someone watched the engine bay.
	•	The engine visibly shifted left and down noticeably each time I gave it some gas. I saw some people saying it’s normal torque but idk??
	•	I also noticed the thunk noise is strongest moving from Park into Drive or Reverse, but barely there between other gears.
	•	The brake was fully pressed, and I always pressed the gear button while shifting.
	•	Shifting quickly made the thunk louder, slow shifting made it quieter but still noticeable.

From what I’ve read and observed, it seems likely the engine or transmission mounts are worn, or there’s some play in the driveshaft or differential causing this sudden torque load to make the noise.

The error code C101D4A in your 2016 VW Golf Sportwagen points to an issue with the right rear ABS wheel speed sensor. Potential causes

* **Incorrect Sensor Installed:** If you've recently replaced the sensor, the C101D4A code might indicate that an incorrect component has been installed, even if the part number appears similar.
* **Water Leakage:** Clogged sunroof drains in the A-pillar area can cause water intrusion and corrosion at the TIUL coupling connector, potentially leading to this fault code.
* **Wiring Issues:** A damaged or corroded wiring harness leading to the ABS wheel speed sensor can also be the culprit.
* **Faulty Sensor:** Though you've replaced the sensor, it's possible the new one is also faulty, or the initial replacement may not have fully resolved the underlying issue.
* **Damaged Wheel Bearing:** The wheel bearing contains a ring that the ABS sensor reads, and damage to this ring can also lead to sensor malfunctions.
* **ABS Module Failure:** In some cases, the ABS control module itself might be faulty, leading to various ABS-related error codes. 

Troubleshooting steps

1. **Verify Sensor Installation:** Double-check that the correct part number and revision of the ABS wheel speed sensor have been installed on the right rear wheel.
2. **Inspect for Water Damage:** Access the TIUL coupling connection in the lower driver's side A-pillar and check for signs of water damage or corrosion.
3. **Inspect Wiring Harness:** Visually inspect the wiring harness leading to the right rear ABS wheel speed sensor for any signs of damage, chafing, or corrosion. You may also want to use a multimeter to check for continuity and shorts.
4. **Consider Professional Diagnosis:** If the issue persists after checking the above, it's recommended to consult a qualified mechanic or dealership for a thorough diagnosis using specialized diagnostic equipment capable of communicating with the car's ABS system. 

**Note:** After replacing components or clearing codes, it's often necessary to perform a basic setting adaptation or drive the vehicle for a short distance and cycle the ignition to allow the system to recognize the changes and clear the fault codes. "

1mmm8p6,DIY piston soak or new car,"Hey everyone,

Me and my wife are a one-car family. We have a 2018 Kia Sportage with 86,000 miles. Two months ago, we had the oil changed, and just recently the oil light came on. We topped it up right away, but it got me worried.

We’re the second owner, so Kia’s oil consumption coverage doesn’t apply to us (it’s only for the first owner). We do have a CPO warranty, but the dealer said they’d have to take the engine apart to inspect it. If it turns out the issue is related to piston rings — which the service advisor said is most likely — the warranty won’t cover it, and we’d be charged to reassemble the engine. That’s not a gamble I want to take.

We still owe about $5,500 on the loan, and trade-in offers are around $9k. Our original plan was to pay this off and then get a second car, but now I’m wondering if we should just trade it in toward something newer and more reliable.

For those who’ve been in a similar situation:

Would you trade it in now or try to fix it and keep driving?

Has anyone done a DIY piston soak with B12 Chemtool or similar to clean the piston area and reduce oil burning?

I’ve also seen people mention using Valvoline Protect Oil — did that actually help in your case?

If you fixed it, how long did your Kia last afterward?

1mmgmmg,My car only drives in reverse now — transmission mystery.,"Hey Reddit mechanics and car wizards,
I’m in deep with my 2009 Pontiac G6 (4T45-E transmission, 120k miles). My lovely car currently only drives in reverse. Yeah, you read that right. Reverse only. It’s like it wants to moonwalk everywhere.

Here’s the deal:
	•	Got into an accident. Ship repairs included replacing transmission cooling lines, radiator, tire, and an alignment.
	•	After repair, the transmission started slipping and hesitating in 1st gear (and a little in 2nd). Not catastrophic, but enough to raise alarms.
	•	Took it to a mechanic, who declared: “You need a new transmission.”
	•	Friend said, “I bet my bottom dollar it’s your transmission fluid.” So me and Dad checked it. Surprise! It was overfilled by about 2 quarts. 🤦‍♀️
	•	I drained and refilled with the correct Dexron VI fluid — about 3 quarts plus a half quart of Lucas additive. Some improvement, but hesitation stuck around after 100 miles.
	•	Did a second drain and fill, replaced the transmission filter (Napa kit 1-9761). The gasket in the kit didn’t line up. So we reused the old one - didn’t touch the o-ring. (Big mistake?)
	•	After driving about 15 miles post-filter change, I stopped at a sign… and suddenly: no forward gear. Nada. Full RPMs, no go. Only reverse now. My car basically said “I’m done with forward progress.”

Current theory from ChatGPT: It might all boil down to the gasket or o-ring.

More fuel to the fire:
	•	The shop’s estimate post-accident mentioned using CVT fluid instead of ATF. Typo or tragedy? Not sure.
	•	Pulled some ominous OBD-II codes:
	•	P18BF
	•	C0040-0F
	•	C0035-18
	•	P0FBB-0F
	•	P00FF-00

I get that P18BF signals transmission pressure or solenoid trouble — but are these codes caused by fluid issues, a failed transmission, or just a cranky sensor?

⸻

So, can anyone help a girl out :
	•	Is my car salvageable or is this the end of the road?
	•	Can wrong or missing gasket/o-ring + fluid drama really cause a car to refuse going forward?
	•	Any ideas on what to try next before I sell it for parts or light it on fire?
	•	Is the Lucas additive a secret magic potion or just snake oil here?

1mmgeb6,CLK (C209) or E46 coupe?,"Hey folks, at some point in the future I'd love to upgrade my 90s econobox to something a bit more interesting.

I'm tossing up between something like a 2002+ Mercedes-Benz CLK320 or 350 (C209), or a BMW E46 coupe, something like a 330ci or 325ci.

For me, the Merc is a beautiful, elegant car with its semi circle window line and frameless doors. I've done a comparison with ChatGPT and am aware the 350, though more powerful has issues with its balance shaft gear / timing sprocket wearing prematurely, and is expensive to fix (pre 2008 models at least). The 320 seems far more reliable, but less powerful.

I really love the E46 coupe too, I think it's a great looking car. The gist I get is it's more ""exciting"" to drive rather than ""cruisy"". Though it does seem to have its own problems with VANOS seals, plastic cooling system parts, suspension bushings and rear subframe cracking.

After driving it for a bit my check engine light came on, I have an OBDII reader and it said it was the O2 sensor so I had brought the car in and had that component replaced and no issue with that but didn't resolve the problem. I had also explained my issues and they said that this would likely resolve it. 

I had it at another shop for a week and they said there was nothing wrong with it but there is.

1mm8lh0,Orange crusties in Chrysler 1.4L-head gasket material?,"2012 Fiat 500, 96k miles with 1.4L MultiAir non-turbo. Had a cyl 3 misfire fault paired with the P1063 oil supply solenoid fault, figured it could be either a plugged oil passage/sticky solenoid or a bad MA solenoid assembly. Fairly regular oil service history provided by the customer.

Did an oil flush for 25 miles with Seafoam just to see if we could clean out any gunk that may be in there, then pulled the MA filter from the side of the head; very clean, just a few tiny specs caught in it. Did the oil change and never got any misfires to return after 100 miles of driving. Car also had some leaky spark plug tube seals, so I wanted to wait until we knew if doing the MA solenoid assembly as it overlaps heavily with valve cover. Since no faults, I pulled the Valve Cover with the intention of just fixing the leaks.

However, I found at the base of all 4 spark plug tubes these strange orange crusties. Looks like ocean coral, and they are very brittle but not magnetic. Thinking it may have been orange RTV that squished up from when the head was installed and isn't an issue, but it definitely caught my eye and wanted to see if anyone else had some insight on what these may be. 

Some of it seems to just be hanging out and not attached, although I doubt it could have stayed there without any sort of attachment with the oil splash happening around it. Other bits seem to be jammed between the tube and the head, lending credence to the idea it squished up.

Also makes me wonder if maybe some of this was contributing to the misfires, could definitely see these jamming up a solenoid.

Middle-Jackfruit-896 (Score: 69): I have a hypothesis. 

Your brake master cylinder has a brake booster that uses engine vacuum as an assist. A leak in this line can affect the air/fuel ratio.

Now why would the booster get damaged by a brake change? When you reset the caliper to install the new pads, the fluid is pushed back through the master cylinder, unless you opened the bleeder screw. If your reservoir was closed and your brake fluid level was already high, there could have been an disturbance on your master cylinder. The master cylinder is connected to the brake booster. That effect on the master cylinder could have somehow disturbed your brake booster or its vacuum line. I would start by looking at that vacuum line to your brake booster for looseness or leaks.

Now you said you changed the calipers so maybe the above hypothesis doesn't hold. Perhaps in installing the new calipers and pumping the brake, you bottomed out the master cylinder and damaged a seal that in turn disturbed the brake booster or its line?

Admitted this may be a stretch but I think it's beyond coincidence that the engine problems occured right after the brake work.

On a related note, how is the brake fluid level in the reservoir? It is very high or very low? Do your brakes work as expected?"

1mm6nuw,Will a bad lower control arm cause ball joints and sway bar links to fail?,"Car: 2011 Toyota Venza AWD with base 4cyl, 180k miles, owned since new, very well maintained  
  
I'll try and keep this brief-ish.  
  
I am a former farm kid who is very mechanically inclined, but not an expert at diagnosing issues. My father went to school to be a mechanic in the 70s and wrenched for a few years before becoming a farmer. He taught me so damn much, which I am incredibly grateful for. I do the lion's share of work on our cars, sometimes after taking it to a mechanic to diagnose an issue.  
  
Last summer, I replaced sway bar links, both lower--and only, on the Venza--ball joints, both CV axles, the top motor mount, and did a full brake job. There had been no issues until recently when my kiddo started experiencing a sort of oscillating or pulsing under acceleration. The rate of oscillation does not change under harder acceleration or at different vehicle speeds.   
  
I took it for a drive and the issue is clearly coming from the front right. My first thought was that the CV I installed had somehow failed. Though, that didn't really jive with the oscillation not changing at higher speeds. Unsure, and not wanting to throw parts at it, I took it to a local Brake Masters I had previously only used for alignments. I let them know the CV was still under warranty. They came back with a list of things: both lower control arms and the right ball joint, sway bar link, engine mount, and wheel hub. (Do shops not just replace bearings any more?) 

When I took the wheels off, I was surprised to see the rubber boots on both ends of the right sway bar link and ball joint were completely blown out. The dust boot on the engine mount had mostly disintegrated and the bushing in both control arms were dry rotted--I have lived in Las Vegas the entire 14 years we've owned the car, so dry rotted rubber is a lifestyle.  
  
Before taking things apart, I grabbed a channel lock and twisted back and forth on both CVs. They felt the same with just a bit of play in both directions. All the boots are clean with no sign of tearing, etc.  

Especially after an unpleasant conversation with the service writer who dropped his quote from $2900 to $2500 after I reiterated I would do the work myself, I am thinking they were going to do the CV because I could get the new one under warranty. I have zero confidence in their word it is bad.

One more note: I replaced both front struts around five or six years ago. After my test drive, there is no reason to believe they are bad.

My questions (finally):   
  
1. Could a bad lower control arm cause the failure of the sway bar link and ball joint? The rubber is dry rotted, but it felt tight on the car and hasn't failed. 

2. Is it possible the engine mount could be responsible for the oscillation I feel under acceleration? 

3. Am I crazy to think the CV is fine and they were just trying to make a few extra bucks?

A torn CV boot or strut mount clunk here and there is more common. That top left side engine mount does like to go early though.

The bushings and boots might look a little tired but they are usually a long way away from causing issues.

Either way, a bad lower control arm will clunk under initial braking from wheel fore/aft movement but not very much under acceleration. The rear side bushings is what always tears. If you see small rips, they are fine, I'm talking stick a screwdriver through the rip kind of tear. And no they wouldn't really cause other suspension components to fail early. The rest all have enough range of motion to deal with bad control arms  
  
For engine mounts, have someone watch the engine while you change gears and see how much the powertrain moves around. It will move some, but with bad mounts it will jump

CVs will vibrate hard under full throttle but not so much when cruising like wheel imbalance. Front right Toyota axles are by far the weakest in reliability.   
  
Not pointing fingers, but do consider installation errors, especially the axles. We all do it. Incorrect axle shaft splines in the hub can wreck it, so can leaving the nut loose or under-torqued."

Since the mounts were just replaced, I ordered another set under warranty and come to find out, the transmission mount was fine, not damaged. Got them all replaced for good measure since I had the kit warrantied, and it is still making a clunking noise when shifting into gear, however it doesn’t do it every single time. It seems like it’s only the first couple times and is intermittent.

Any ideas? Could the lower control arms be making that noise if the bushings are bad? Sounds like it’s definitely engine bay but can’t say for certain. I’m scared it’s the transmission but unsure how to verify.

Few months back I started to notice knocking sound coming from engine during cold startup. The noise goes away after few mins of running.

My questions are:

1. Is it ok to just change the tensioner instead of replacing the entire timing belt kit? I can change the tensioner on my own with help from friends, but for the TB kit I'll have to go for a mechanic who is charging a hefty $1200.
2. Can I just replace the spark plugs and not do valve adjustment and other stuff? That mechanic told me to get a complete tune up at the same time and is charging hefty $700. I consulted another mechanic and he said that these newer vehicles don't really need valve adjustment and getting spark plugs replaced should be enough.

A tune up won’t help with that, no. “Tune up” is generally engine related maintenance. You have a transmission problem. 

Honestly I would focus on that since it’s probably the most pressing and expensive. If you have a transmission problem and changing the fluid did something for it and now it has problems again then that’s a deeper problem inside the transmission. Changing the fluid and it getting better was a bandaid over fixing the actual problem."

I'll try to be as detailed as I can in my post; but it's currently 2:30am and I have been awake for like 40 hours

car in question; 2000 Hyundai Elantra, 1.6 petrol dohc, 193k km (roughly 120k miles), second owner, 

the car used to occasinally misfire on some rainy or damp mornings, but I replaced the spark plugs, cables and coils roughly a year ago and that fixed it

it only happened a couple times since, until today, when I parked my car like normal at a friend's birthday party, but when I started it back up 6 hours later I noticed an immediate lack of power

limped it home on 3 cylinders, ran OBD2, only mentions cylinder 3 misfire; I did disconnect (and clean) that cable to confirm the cylinder in question but I won't be removing the spark plugs or coils right now (I should still have the original coils to test with)

context; I ran it pretty low on fuel but I tend to do that somewhat often, student things, filled it up and it drove just fine for 15 minutes before I parked for the event

I did however haul myself and 4 others there, and back, which is significantly more load than just my usual self


so, question, where do I start digging?

I have a connector under the steering wheel which can shut the car off if messed with and even trick the speedo into giving a reading, it can also shut off the check engine light while the key is in the ignition position,nbut I don't see it being cyl per cyl wiring from here, at least I hope

do I change back to original coils first? do I pull the spark plug out and check for spark first? if I have spark, could a blocked injector cause this? how the fuck do I even pull an injector 😔

Sometimes it's when going straight (rarely), then other times it's when only slightly turning the wheel but most often it's when turning in and out of junctions. No longer is it just a quiet little squeak occasionally happening when the vans in full lock.

As a general overview, they will probably ask for photos of the damage, proof of your travel dates and whether you think you could drive it home. If you can't drive it, they will decide whether to repatriate it (you will need to provide them with the V5 for this) or dispose of it abroad. This will be dependent on where it is, the cost of the repairs needed and the value of the car. It will not however happen immediately.

1mmq744,Avoid MAPLE CARS – Unprofessional and Aggressive Experience,"Just wanted to share a warning about a small-scale car dealer based in Burton-On-Trent called **MAPLE CARS**, run by Ian Hibberd (not to be confused with Maple Garage, which is a completely different business). This dealer does not have a website and operates on a very small scale, but the whole interaction raised a lot of red flags.

From the start, he kept talking about being a chartered accountant and selling cars to his neighbours, even specifying where they work, as if that alone proved his trustworthiness. Things went downhill quickly once my dad started doing basic checks to see if the car had been in any serious crashes. He became visibly agitated and manipulative, muttering things like “I feel like a criminal” or “ridiculous” when we asked him to start the engine with the bonnet open so we could hear it.

He repeatedly pressured us, asking several times whether we were “interested”, lecturing us about how great the car was, and becoming defensive when we pointed out obvious red flags such as mismatched tyres (winter tyres on one side only). At one point, he even called my dad “crazy” for asking about it.

After about 20 minutes of this tense back-and-forth, he claimed other customers were coming, still with that pretentious and aggressive tone, clearly trying to rush us into a decision. Not long after, I received a text from him (pictured) that summed up his unprofessionalism: passive-aggressive, guilt-tripping and arrogant.

In my opinion, he came across as manipulative, defensive and mentally unstable. I would strongly recommend avoiding MAPLE CARS altogether.

The service history is a bit odd: the first service was 3,000 miles late, and then it wasn’t really driven for a year.

After some further research, it looks like the car was a long-term loan media car for Evo magazine. This probably explains the heavy mileage in the first year and the sudden lack of usage in the second year—on the assumption that it was just parked up at Renault HQ once returned.

I’m possibly being overly cautious but I’ve been caught out in the past getting overly excited when viewing a car and not noticing the car had missed its 3rd service (an M3 on 62k miles).

The early cars can be had for under five grand. Low mileage pristine ones perhaps a touch more, and the coupe is more expensive than the convertible. The Z4M is of course more again. 

Maintenance is surprisingly cheap, particularly if you’re willing to get your hands dirty - they’re old enough that not everything is fully electric and you can fix it with a socket set rather than requiring a computer. On the flipside, because they’re older some things will need replacing just due to ‘ageing out’ even if the mileage is low. Parts aren’t that expensive though, I’ve replaced the shocks/springs and all the brakes on mine and barely spent £1000 - but I did all that myself. A new starter motor cost me 100 quid - again DIY.

Have really narrowed it down to:

Audi Q3 2.0 TDI - Not bad and the wife is fond, but I am concerned with the boot size as my Golf is only slightly smaller and we agree that for our needs we need a bigger primary car.

Audi Q5 2.0 TDI - Budget only really gives us the bottom of the barrel choices without S Line so might have to pass on this.

BMW X3 2.0D M Sport F35 - Personally my favourite as a BMW fan. However do need to take into account the n47 timing chain which am budgeting to get replaced as soon as purchased if we went X3.

Volvo XC60 2.4 D4/5 - This was a surprised as never looked at Volvos before but has a good right up, looks like more pre facelifts are in budget. Tax is a bit higher and so is MPG but a larger engine so no suprise.

Kia Sportage 2.0 CRDI KX (QL 4th Gen) - Looking at the 2.0 Diesel which engine apparently is reliable however seemed a mixed bag of reviews on the gearbox. Do quite like the 'tiger' front, however feel interior is my least favourite from the above.

You can ask, but it's very unlikely that they would give a refund, in my experience car dealers are hard parted with their cash. The wording around this is that you have to give them fair opportunity to fix the issue, and they have to do it in a reasonable time, but I'm not sure how long that is relevant for. I think at 10 months, it would be determined that the fault wasn't there when your Dad bought the car (I could be wrong, so someone please correct me if I am, I have it in my head it's 6 months, as a 3 month warranty is doing yourself out of 3 months, as all cars should get a minimum 6 months).

Do you have the documentation for the 12 month warranty? You need to know if it should have been covered, and if they owe your dad £700.

I had a similar argument with a dealer recently, I bought a bag a shit off them, and my Dad also has terminal cancer, and I needed to get him to the hospital etc.

I have a total budget of £9,000 for both a car and insurance. My current insurance ends in November this year, but I’d like to get a new car by October if possible.

I’m looking for something that’s visually appealing, has plenty of features, and feels reasonably modern.  
One option I’ve been considering is a 2015 Mazda 3 I like the interior, it has a lot of features, and I could upgrade it to support CarPlay. Insurance would be around £4,500, and the car itself would be about £4,000.

1mmju6w,How do people feel about the new vehicle tax rates from April 2025?,"I was looking over the latest vehicle tax bands that came into effect this April, and I’m curious how others see them. The highest band is now £5,490 for the first year, plus a £425 supplement if the car’s list price is over £40,000. That’s £5,915 in year one, followed by £620 annually until the vehicle reaches six years old.

I know we’re still cheaper than some parts of Europe, but I can’t help remembering the 2006 changes - back when a Ford Mondeo was suddenly £400 a year in tax (now £735). That felt like a big jump at the time.

My current car is £430 a year, but if I were to buy the same model new now, it would jump to £3,300 for the first year, plus the £425 supplement.

I get that everyone’s priorities are different, but for me, it’s another nudge away from buying new, especially with all the electronic features that still feel a bit rough around the edges.

Normal insurance companies can get a little scared of this, especially if you're a newer driver (I assume so given the 1 NCB).  

Specialist ones specifically for car modifications can be more expensive initially, but after all the declared mods normally work out a bit cheaper than traditional insurance companies. Will let you google for these.  

You should speak to your insurance companies to see how they handle putting parts on the car that came from the higher trim levels onto yours. Mine said they didn't care/it didn't cost any extra.  

So, if you're celica is the one without the spoiler, you may be able to just chuck on a OEM spoiler without having to tell your insurance. Or to chuck on T Sport wheels without telling them. 

For my celica, I have the seats, door cars, and wheels from the higher trim without additional cost. Tho I will say, I much prefer the cloth seats to the leather ones after changing :P

So I'm thinking that if I'm priced out with notably higher salary than median average, won't the majority of Europeans also be priced out? Second hand market will explode but what happens with car industry?

All companies seem to be chasing big profit margin and the biggest one is in premium class. But if all companies chase top 10% of buyers and those top 10% keep buying BMW/Mercedes where will money come for the likes of Volkswagen and Renault? They are pricing out their own customer base. Do you pay 35k for brand new Series 1 or Golf that is worse in every way than BMW?

Provided the oil has been changed in line with manufacturers intervals, which is yearly or every 12k miles, they are an incredibly robust engine, and generally a very robust car, 300k-400k miles isnt uncommon on one of these, common wear and tear issues are trailing arm bushes, and dpf pressure pipes, which is two pipes that run from dpf to the dpf pressure sensor they cost about £5 and take 10 mins to fit.

We have had few of them in the family and they have all been very reliable, i ran a 2008 car from 90k to 170k in two and a half years, only things I had to replace on top of the normal items was the trailing arm bushes, and dpf pressure pipes, clutch was the original.

1mmbhvw,Audi S5 2017 for Mercedes A250 2019?,"Hello all experienced car enthusiasts!

I am in the market to buy a “faster” car. I have put down a small “refundable” deposit on an Audi S5 with 80,000 miles, FSH and no known issues. 

I would be PXing my 2019 Mercedes 2.0 A250 (Premium Plus) and £1700 cash.

I’m not asking if this is worth the money as it’s not really a problem and don’t mind spending a bit extra for more power. 

My question is, is it worth my while just for a bit more power? And is buying a 80k well maintained S5 a good choice?

Thanks

You can tweak to your hearts content with upgrades and tuning. Engines always have way more potential. Just have to remember that you’re moving to an older car, more chances of things to go wrong, albeit only two years. But who knows the same might happen to the merc.

Does the Audi put a smile on your face in a test drive? Absolutely yes, with the biggest grin? = then go for it.

If it only sorta does, and you go ‘this is nice’ = stick with the merc, save up and maybe get something a little newer.

pb-86 (Score: 1): Imo there's no doubt the Audi is better than the merc. It's in a different league and it's definitely worth the swap. Just bare in mind the maintenance will be more expensive on them though. I'm always wary of higher mileage performance cars, and would definitely spend a bit more to get a lower mileage example,ornspend some time saving up to make that possible.

Things to consider, the 2017 model had a flawed rocker arm, which was revised in autumn 2018. The tell that this part is failing is a build up of noise, so pay attention to that as this is a very expensive repair

The water pump and associated equipment tents to fail at around 90k miles.

The pc valve is a common failure point on these cars and can cause a very rough idle and misfires. Worth seeing if this car has had it replaced, and if not do some research in to trying to clean it out to make is last longer.

Transmission fluid should be changed every 50k miles, just verify this was done on one of the services, or get it done yourself when you get the car

Wellidrivea190e (Score: 1): An A Class is not a well built car, an Audi S5 is. It’s likely to give you less trouble, but parts will be more expensive. The Audi for sure will be more expensive to run but will likely be the better car. Audis are solid."
1mm5gmw,ULEZ woes,"Put a refundable deposit down on a new (to me) car - Mercedes C class C220 Blutec sport line 2015 advertised as euro 6 and ULEZ compliant. I was convinced that ULEZ wouldn’t be a problem and on HPI check coming through as ULEZ compliant. However when checking actual UK Gov website with the Reg number it says not ULEZ compliant. I found this quite baffling as I’ve checked dozens of the same car, same exact spec from the same year from various other dealers with all of them coming up with ULEZ compliant including even a year older models of the same car 

Haven’t been able to check the log book for actual emissions standards/recorded (which I will do tomorrow revisiting the showroom) but what are the chances there has been a mistake in how the vehicle is registered on the UK Gov ULEZ checking website 

Just seems a bit strange that this specific car is recorded as non compliant whilst all others I’ve seen are compliant. ",0,1754788049.0,19,CartalkUK,1754940980,2025-08-10 01:07:29,2025-08-11 19:36:20,"Unfair-Software-4240 (Score: 5): Most diesel cars after 2016 are ulez.

Tried the Vax SpotWash and found it to be quite loud. I measured around 78db with a 'decibel meter' from the app store about 10cm away from it.

I find around 70db to be acceptable since my regular vacuum and air duster are of this sound level.

Would appreciate if anyone can send in readings of their extractor vacuum if it is around 70db.

Everything else is diabolical. 120 odd quid for air and pollen filters should be criminal, it's a 10 minute job to do both and most cars you don't even need tools to do them, just undo a couple clips and replace a filter. Easier than replacing a filter on a vacuum or something"
