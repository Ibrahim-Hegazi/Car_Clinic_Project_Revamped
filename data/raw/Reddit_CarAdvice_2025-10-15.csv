1o6vz0q,Not the head gaskets...,"Recently I've been noticing a few indicators of blown head gaskets in my 2008 Dodge Grand Caravan, 3.3L. White smoke from the exhaust, EGR and cylinder misfire codes, and poor shifting.

1o6v6de,"Went to Jiffy Lube and they overfilled my oil, what should I do to prove that they are at fault?","I have a 2017 Volvo xc60 t5 inscription with 125k miles. Pretty regular oil changes although I haven't been the best always. Well I went in to get my oil serviced (now I know better and to take it somewhere that deals with European cars) and no problems when I drive in besides my check engine light that's been on for a couple of years (please don't come for me, I'm trying to get everything taken care of). But I have had no problems with my car with how it drives. So they change my oil, I ask for them to show me the quality of my oil because my husband said it didn't need an oil change yet but I want to take care of my car and get it done more frequently so I ask to see, they said it was fine and I probably didn't need an oil change yet. But then, they cannot get my oil filter off so they nice enough didn't charge for the service at all and gave me the oil filter. I thanked them many times and left.

 As soon as I left I had major problems before even getting less than 1 mile. The car was stalling and acting like it was going to die. I pulled over and stopped the engine immediately, then I call Jiffy Lube, they ask to bring it back (which I did because it was super close and thought it was my best hope). They looked at everything and said you have some codes popping up and only have a few miles left before it just won't start anymore. The codes they pull are attached ---- PO54B B B1 Camshaft Position Timing over-retarted, and P0014 B Camshaft B1 Pos - Timing Over Advanced or system performance. The head guy tries to explain what's wrong with my car and I tell him these codes have been here for a while and my car has always driven just fine with no problems until immediately after I left the shop. They check my oil level, but then I find out my oil pressure gage isn't working and have no manual dipstick. So I decide to leave I try to drive off after he told me I wasn't going to damage my car by driving it but just that it won't start anymore once these sensors fail, he said that the clean oil must have uncovered the sensor and failed due to the clean oil and that the dirty oil was preventing them from failing due to something I can't remember the exact logic. So I drive off but then realize my tail pipe is smoking bad! I pull over and have my car towed home. 

My husband checks it and sure enough they put 12 quarts of oil in my car which I took a picture of. We researched this scenario and found that the excess oil should burn off after drained and the proper amount is put in. My husband did that and put a new oil filter in. It's much better but still smoking and driving a little rough. 

My question is, what would you recommend I do and how to prove that they are liable? I think I need to bring my car to Volvo and have them inspect it at Jiffy Lube's expense to start. But if there is any other advice that I could use with personal experience I would greatly appreciate it. My husband is quite good with my car and if there is a much simpler option to start with I'm open to anyone that is willing to help.

Recently noticed my outer driver side CV boot had a slit in it and was spewing grease. Inspected the other side and passenger inner boot is completely separated in the middle. So my questions are this:

1. Thoughts on aftermarket vs OEM axles/boots?
2. Would grinding be from axles?
3. Replace whole axle or just replace boots?
4. Do I need different/longer axles to reconcile the leveling kit?

cparks1 (Score: 1): CV axles usually make a clicking or popping noise while turning when they start going bad. If you're hearing a growling or rubbing noise only when hitting a bump while turning, it's more likely that your tires are rubbing on something.

As far as the torn CV boots, in my experience it's less of a pain to just replace the whole axle. If they aren't clicking yet you can put it off for a little while, but they will need replaced eventually. For just a leveling kit stock axles are fine."

1o6sqme,How can save my 2009 Chevrolet Malibu 3.6L V6?,"TLDR; bought a car two days ago, mechanic at pre-purchase inspection said it can be saved, Firestone mechanic says i should not have bought it. Need advice on what to repair/if it's worth it.

Hello mechanics of reddit,

  
A couple of days ago I bought a car to help me move about, but not for my commute. At the pre-purchase inspection the mechanic gave a laundry list of repairs (\~$1700) needed but said this is to be expected with a used car from 2009. Given that I was buying the car for only $2100, a total cost of $4k fell well within my budget so I gave the green light. As soon as I drove off I get a check engine light come up, but the mechanic said the engine and transmission are fine, so I didn't think too much about it. But as I was driving i noticed the power steering was struggling a bit and something told me to get another check, so i did that.

  
Fast forward to today, I got it checked out at Firestone and they tell me DO NOT BUY THIS CAR. My shock+shame stopped me from correcting them and saying I have already bought it. The firestone pretty much noted the same thing as the previous guy but very different conclusion. My question is what can i get away with not fixing? What can I fix myself/what needs to be fixed in shop? I have basically no experience but I am not in a rush so I am fine with learning. Just to reiterate: this is not a commuter vehicle or anything critical to my life.

You also don't need a second car at all. A standalone battery would do the same job, if charged enough. A running engine would just increase the current voltage from 12V to something up to 14,7V which could help when you have bad connection anyway.

You can also put the ground cable basically anywhere on the car. Bare metal parts are often a good spot for this. I like to use motor hooks, where you hang up the engine, for this (Don't know the exact name put I'll show you a picture.)

1o6s0a0,Ford Escape 2014 camera not working (from 2013 donor lid),"I have a 2014 ford escape (SE), referred as Main, with a dented trunk lid. I have found a new lid that was on a 2013 Ford escape (SEL), referred as Donor, with the same functionality, rearview camera-automatic liftgate.

After replacing the lid, everything works well but the camera. I get an error saying ""Camera is unvalable Please contact your dealership"".

I've used ForSCAN to get details on the issue (2013 Module):

I have replaced the camera and its connector cable with the Main's, and still have the same issue. My next guess is either the Rear Gate/Trunk Module itself, perhaps 2013's does not match with 2014, or the cables on the Donor trunk.  
I am unsure on how to diagnose the issue further and solve it. Thank you for your help!

I have replaced the Donor trunk module with Main's (2014), and I got different errors. I believe these are much more relevant to my issue. See the issues below:

Are they missing something obvious?,"Hey everyone, I'm at my wit's end and hoping some pros can shed some light on what might be happening with my car. I think my shop is in over their head, and I need to understand if this is a common diagnostic nightmare or just incompetence.

**The Car:**

* **2006 Toyota Corolla**
* **Original Code:**¬†P0420 (Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold)

**The Saga:**

* The shop's initial diagnosis noted the¬†**upstream O2 sensor was saturated with oil from a valve cover leak**. This was their own finding.
* They replaced the catalytic converter and, later, the O2 sensors.
* It's now been¬†**THREE MONTHS**. The shop has been ""driving cycles"" trying to get the monitors to set, but they can't.
* The car was finally taken for an emissions test and was¬†**rejected for ""monitor readiness""**¬†‚Äì it wouldn't even run the test.
* They've claimed to consult with Toyota and try ""tips,"" but nothing works. They've now told me we're at an ""impasse.""

**The Big Red Flag:**  
Their own notes pointed to an¬†**oil leak from the valve cover**¬†as the root cause that killed the original O2 sensor. I have a sinking feeling they never fixed that leak, and it's now contaminating the new O2 sensor(s) and possibly the new cat, preventing the monitors from running their checks properly.

**My Questions for You Pros:**

1. **Is it common for a P0420 repair to turn into a 3-month ordeal trying to set monitors?**
2. **If a valve cover leak was the suspected root cause, how critical is it to fix that**¬†***before***¬†**or**¬†***at the same time as***¬†**the cat/O2 sensors? Could a persistent leak cause exactly this kind of ""monitors won't set"" hell?**
3. **From the outside, does this sound like a legitimately tricky diagnostic case, or does it sound like the shop is just throwing parts at the problem without a logical diagnostic process?**
4. **What would be your next diagnostic step if this car was in your bay?**

Any insight would be hugely appreciated. I'm trying to figure out if I need to give this shop more patience or if I should immediately tow it out of there and cut my losses.

Trucks starter should not do anything at all, until you push the key full start. If the starter is making noise in any other position you have some mixed up wires. 

The ignition switch has multiple switches in it and each one receives power at different times. You can put the key in (switch one powered) turn to ACC (switch two powered) move to start position (switch three powered) then pushing it forward powers the fourth switch which also sends power to the starter to start. 

I would absolutely check your wires for any unwanted resistance, if everything else is powering expect the starter

River_2675 (Score: 1): Should and is, are 2 different words

Pull the ignition relay and see if there is power being supplied to attempt to start the truck in any of the given ignition positions, just so you don't damage the starter and you can leave the truck in given ignition positions for extended periods for testing

Power to the ignition relay control side should only exist on start, if it exists in any other position then the circuit is being commanded on by the ignition 

I'd be curious if the start command exists when the ignition switch is out but the key on power is being jumped manually to the fuse box from battery 

Since the problem only started since the steering column and the transmission was changed, maybe pull any of the wiring harnesses apart that you have connected in the process of changing those parts and see if there is still the same start command to the starter relay, once is suddenly stops attempting to command the starter relay control side then you are getting very close to the potential crossed wire"

The Sonic was down to a ¬º tank and I figured I‚Äôd just top it off with fresh gas and dilute everything out. Didn‚Äôt think much of it or rather I rationalized it to myself that everything would be OK. 

After I filed up I ended up with about a 50/50 mix of bad gas and good and almost immediately the engine would hesitate and id get a P0171 code every time drove. If I tried to pass someone at ~3.5K-4K RPM with 50% or more of throttle it‚Äôd puke smoke out the exhaust.  First time it did this I thought I fried my rings or blew a head gasket but both oil levels and coolant levels were fine. 

Feeling like I had no other option I proceeded to drive the car with that bad gas till I got down to ¬º tank then filled it back up with with fresh gas and a can of BG 44K.

I‚Äôm about 50 miles into that 2nd tank with the 44K in it and I still get the P0171 error every now and then, and once I got a P2270 code.

1o6dog4,"Tick, and then cylinder lost power?!","The alternator in my sisters 2011 chevy cruze 1.4L was making a clicking noise, definitely coming from the alternator or somewhere very closeby. It sounded like pens clicking, randomly, no pattern to it at all. You could feel the clicks in the alternator (This alternator click was definitely not from inside the engine, it sounded and felt like the alternator gear teeth were slipping inside of the alternator). The tensioner was not jumping around. I took the alternator to a parts store, they tested it and said it passed, and it wasn't making any noises for them. 


I put the alternator back in and we started the car, and again began to hear the clicks from the alternator after about a minute. The car was running fine, just as it was before, with a click from the alternator area. I stood watching the car for about 3-4 minutes while running, trying to decide whether or not to replace the alternator or wait for the noise to get worse (the noise was not that bad or too loud). Suddenly, after 3-4 minutes of running normally, a completely different click appeared. This one was loud, rhythmic with the engine, fast paced, and it was coming from within the engine. I grabbed my phone and recorded a video, in which I pointed to where the noise was coming from. After running with the new loud click for about 60 seconds, the car seemed to lose power from one of the pistons, and began revving up and down. I am pretty sure the clicking stopped when this happened. The car continued to run on ¬æ pistons for maybe 7-10 seconds until we shut it off (as fast as we could). We never heard a loud bang, or any bang, just the sudden loss of power. Oil was checked 4 days before this and was full. Oil is still full.

Where do I start and what small things could I check first, in order to try and avoid opening the valve cover. Any advice would be helpful.

1o6lhau,My experience with 2nd gen Ford Escape,"This might be a long read but wanted to share my personal experience with these cars. My first introduction of it was when I happened to rent a 2011 Escape from Turo and I fell in love with the boxy shape and the space. Last year in Jul I broke my hand falling from an e-bike and decided to buy a second hand Escape. Money was tight as a student so I bought an as-is 2011 Escape XLT from a private seller for $2800CAD. It had 175k km, rust on the tailgate and rear wheel arch but I wanted to use it as a winter beater until I graduated and could buy a better one. From the moment I drove it, it had issues. A CEL from a misfiring cylinder that wouldn‚Äôt go despite new spark plugs, ignition coils and fuel injectors. It broke down on the highway due to some broken front brake calliper so I got that towed and fixed as well. A few months later, the CEL was flashing and the car would shake horribly on the highway so I decided to get it inspected at Ford. They said it is something deeper in the engine and it would cost a lot. I had already spent $2000 in maintenance, diagnostics and repairs. So, I declined spending more and drove it until the end of winter when the muffler broke and was dragging on the road. I scrapped it and got $200. 

Since I was still absolutely in love with the car design I decided to look for another one but in the Limited trim and sold by a reputed third party dealer. I bought a safetied 09 Limited for $10,000 that included the cost of one year warranty from Lubrico. This car was in great condition and 142k km mileage. Three months later, the alternator and AC condenser broke, so I got it fixed through the warranty. I also had to get some suspension repairs (front control arm, rear struts, stabiliser links, front axle/cv boot) that wasn‚Äôt covered so spent out of pocket for that. I didn‚Äôt mind it since I wanted to use this car for long term, so I also got all the fluids serviced. The car ran fine all these months for 6000km until yesterday when there was a coolant leak, and the car started overheating. I immediately stopped and had it towed. The battery also died for some reason. 
So it‚Äôs at the mechanic shop right now and I‚Äôm crossing my fingers that the head gasket hasn‚Äôt blown or it‚Äôs not anything major. 

I am completely broken mentally. I concede that the first Escape was my fault since I bought an as-is car for only $2800 so I can‚Äôt expect much out of it. I was okay getting just $200 after spending nearly $5000 on it since it served its purpose for 7 months when I needed it. But with this second Escape, I took as much as precautions I could. Buying it safetied from a reputed dealer, paying the extra $1000 for warranty (which has come handy), and I have babied it from the start. I‚Äôve been on top of maintenance and taking care of it like it‚Äôs brand new. I see so many 2nd gen‚Äôs on the road in worse cosmetic conditions than mine but somehow I‚Äôve been very unlucky. My gf strongly advised me against buying it again but I convinced her it‚Äôll be okay. I feel absolutely gutted and hopeless.

But hopefully we can find an answer!

So there is an imported RHD Japanese car on a website that I'm looking at.

The car is located in Minnesota and has a clean Minnesota title. I‚Äôm located in New Hampshire. 
If I buy the car, is the Minnesota title all I need to register the car in the state of New Hampshire?

Or is there other import paperwork that is needed? Because the Japanese VINs are not like ""traditional"" USA car VINs.

So I don't know if there would be any potential issues at the town clerk when registering.

So, I would be getting a bill of sale, and the Minnesota title signed into my name. Is there anything else I would need to register an imported Japanese vehicle in NH?

Ive seen a lot of those little Kei trucks running around in NH, and I'm sure those guys have had the same registration questions in the past!

I'm not looking at a Kei truck, but I would imagine they're the same process!

So any insight let me know!

now, i tested it out once again and it will not let me shift gears! my car is automatic (if that matters)

i checked the transmission fluid to see if i was just low on fluid, but it seemed fine. however i didn't check the fuses so i'll be doing that tomorrow. and then i'll check under my steering wheel the little compartment and see if its the shift solenoid

1. if it's a blown fuse, where can i get a new one? and which fuse would i replace for my braking fuse. how do i tell if it's blown? im assuming if it looks burnt.

2. how expensive is it to buy a new fuse

3. how expensive is a shift solenoid and is it a hard repair to do myself?

id rather not spend a lot of money getting it fixed if its an easy fix that i can do myself with a screwdriver.

If your Jetta went completely dead, no power, no crank, no dash lights and then randomly came back to life a week later, even with a new battery, you‚Äôre likely dealing with an intermittent electrical issue, not something mechanical. Here‚Äôs a quick hit list of things worth checking.  Main ground connection. Loose or corroded grounds can kill all power and then fix themselves when things shift or the weather changes. Battery terminals or cables. Even with a new battery, bad or loose connections can shut the whole system down. Fuses & relays. Especially the main fuse or power distribution relay. If one‚Äôs cracked or overheating, it could cut all power intermittently. Ignition switch or start/stop button module. These are known to fail in some VWs and can kill power completely. Water damage in the fuse box or ECU. Seen this happen after heavy rain. Super annoying to diagnose.

Honestly, dealerships suck at tracking down problems unless the car is actively throwing codes or failing in front of them. You might have better luck with a VW-specialist indie shop that‚Äôs willing to dig in. Also, not gonna lie this kind of random surprise failure is exactly why I got CarShield. My car left me stranded once, and after paying out of pocket for a mystery electrical fix that cost way too much, I was done gambling. They‚Äôve covered a few repairs since, so it paid off for me worth considering if your Jetta keeps acting haunted. Start with grounds, relays, and wiring. Skip the dealer if they can‚Äôt find it and find a VW-savvy shop. And yeah‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre not wrong for not trusting it anymore."

You'll need a balljoint separator.  You'll need a jack and sturdy jack-stands.  You'll also need some grease for sure.  Maybe some loctite.

So I decided to take my car to a highly reviewed mechanic nearby because the mechanic I usually go to is super unresponsive and never answers. My 2014 Hyundai Elantra had a transmission issue the other day ‚Äî it wouldn‚Äôt move in Drive ‚Äî and my dad and I ended up adding transmission fluid ourselves to get it working again.

I was worried I might have a leak, so I brought it into this shop just to have them check. They went over everything ‚Äî transmission, brakes, etc. Their comments:

* **Transmission:** only leaking from the transmission plug, nothing to worry about.
* **Rear brakes:** 5% left, rotors rusted, D-side caliper locked up.

The mechanic was stressing that the car was unsafe to drive. Based on that, I‚Äôm wondering ‚Äî is it really that bad? Could I realistically wait until Saturday to work on the brakes myself with my dad? The quote they gave for replacing the rear brake pads and rotors was **$1,000**, which seems crazy given that my dad and I just did the front brakes not too long ago.

Pros of the shop:

* They were thorough, checked everything.
* Likely tightened up a few things on my transmission plug, which might explain why the fluid hasn‚Äôt leaked since.

Cons:

* They made it sound like the car was extremely unsafe to drive immediately.
* $1,000 quote for rear brakes feels outrageous.

I‚Äôm leaning toward just doing the rear brakes with my dad over the weekend instead of going through the shop, but I‚Äôm curious ‚Äî am I underestimating the risk here, or is this pretty common for mechanics to stress the danger to upsell?

I suspected a failing turbo charger, and found that there is a special warranty for the turbo charger for my make/ model.

I'm the second owner, and the Carfax shows that there was a 17,000 mile gap where the first owner didn't report any oil changes ( bought around 24k miles). The car is currently at 60k miles and has gotten oil changes every 10k miles - which I'm aware is not what is suggested.

I brought the car to the dealership. They confirmed that only the po299 code was displaying, and they replaced the warrantied part for free. 
I also asked them to perform an oil change and they forgot to do it. They called me to come get my car after they thoroughly checked it.

As soon as I start driving away the engine is making a knocking noise that it definitely was not making before. The sluggish issues return immediately. I brought the car back immediately and let him know that there were additional issues. 

Days go by and the service member is refusing to share the cel codes with me, and is basically insinuating that the lack of oil change broke the engine. I explained that the engine knocking was not there when I dropped the vehicle off, and that they didn't find any issues when they repaired it initially, so I would expect that we were all on the same page that the engine was fine when I dropped it off. 

Now that I've been handed over to a manager they are looking at the oil change history and saying that the engine was bad when I brought the car in and that is what caused the turbocharger to fail. Since I know that there was no engine knocking prior to dropping it off, and that no additional CEL codes were showing initially, I feel like something happened to the car during their repair and they are trying to get out of being responsible for it.

I feel like I need to challenge this further, but would like some advice on if the irregular oil change history over 60,000 miles would cause the engine to break, or if it is more likely that something happened to it during their repair and they're trying to cover for it.

Ok so here‚Äôs the deal

My wife‚Äôs 2021 Mazda CX30 with 48k miles broke down and wouldn‚Äôt go into drive and all the urgent alerts go off. We got it towed to the dealership. They told us that there‚Äôs very little transmission fluid (pictured is the note from the dealership.) there were no signs of a leak. So they added transmission fluid and it works fine, but does make some noises that it never did, and that concerns me because it is relatively low miles.

When they were explaining what happened, they asked if it had any work done in the past little while. There had, an oil change from a mom and pop shop with great ratings that‚Äôs been around for a while. They said that the shop probably drained the transmission fluid instead of the engine oil.

On a separate occasion, around the time of the oil change, the check engine light came on so we took it to this same dealership. They said it had a bad catalytic converter so they replaced it since it was under warranty.

I know that engine oil and transmission fluid look totally different, plugs are totally separate. I imagine that‚Äôs pretty tough to do and not fix, even if you did accidentally drain it.

The point of a plug-in hybrid is you can do electric for the vast majority of journeys and use the engine when needed for longer range.

1o6kspb,Trying to wrap my head around PCP with extras vs cash,"Advised by r/UKPersonalFinance to also post here.

Advice wanted for my family member who is looking to buy a ¬£12-13k used car. We have the cash to buy outright. The dealer made it sound like buying with cash wasn't worth due to the loss of incentives, though I have read this is mainly because they get commission from PCP sales.

I'm trying to weigh-up the cost of PCP interest vs the cost of the free services + deposit contribution, and also struggling to wrap my head around opportunity cost.

PCP offer as I am aware:

* ¬£8,309 finance over 24-months, after initial deposit of ¬£4,500 + dealer ¬£250 deposit contribution.
* 11.9% APR.
* Includes first two car services (expected yearly for two years) - if not cancelled within first 7-monthly payments.

Using money facts compare APR calculator, it states the monthly repayment would be ¬£388.41. Compared to ¬£346.21 (¬£8309/24) if I were to theoretically save again. Making the difference about ¬£40 per month.

So 7 months interest payments would cost around ¬£280.

Looking online, it seems car services cost around ¬£200 (interim), ¬£250 (full), ¬£300 (major) locally.

I get confused given the reported 'benefit' of ¬£400+ in service costs by using PCP for 7-months at an apparent costs of ¬£280 interest. Yet, from looking online it seems buying outright with cash is preferable unless you can't afford to.

In terms of opportunity costs, family has a cash ISA at 4.06% AER, and cannot be reassured to put any significant amount in S&S ISA due to perceived risk. So putting the ¬£8,309 in cash ISA instead of buying car outright would net about ¬£200 over 7-months.

The way my brain sees it is either:

* Paying ¬£280 PCP interest, gaining ¬£200 cash ISA interest, to gain ¬£400+ value of service costs; or
* No PCP interest + no cash ISA interest, requiring ¬£400 in service costs.

Because it seems so close or I have got myself properly confused, especially with service costs actually varying dependent on garage, I am seeking your help.",1,1760460487.0,1,CartalkUK,1760556875,2025-10-14 16:48:07,2025-10-15 19:34:35,"Minidooper (Score: 1): Or better, finance to get the ¬£250 dealer contribution.¬† Then immediately pay off the loan sacrificing the services."

1o6fksb,"W205 C-Class Coupe ‚Äì Battery error, reverse camera freezing, and start/stop not working","# Hi everyone,

I bought a W205 C-Class 220 Coupe (Premium Line) 2016 a couple of months ago and have been really happy with it overall, except the start/stop feature has never worked since I got it. Everything else seemed fine, so I didn‚Äôt worry too much at first.

A few weeks ago, I had to leave the UK for a family emergency, and the car was parked up for about three weeks. When I got back, I started it up and immediately got a **battery warning,** the little battery symbol along with the message *‚ÄúStop vehicle ‚Äì leave engine running‚Äù*. I‚Äôve tried leaving it running for long periods, but the warning doesn‚Äôt go away.

One morning, the battery completely died to the point I couldn‚Äôt even lock the car. I jump-started it, and it‚Äôs been fine since, in terms of starting, but I still get the ‚Äúleave vehicle running‚Äù message about half the time.

I recently had the car serviced, and the technician said the battery was showing a healthy 12V, so he advised not to replace it yet. However, this week I‚Äôve noticed a new issue: whenever I put the car in **reverse**, the camera comes on but immediately **freezes**, and when I shift back into **Drive**, a bunch of warning lights flash up on the dash, including *‚ÄúCollision Prevention Assist Plus Inoperative‚Äù*. Everything clears within 30 seconds, but it happens every time I reverse.

So my questions are:

* Do you think I should just replace the battery despite the 12V reading?
* Could this all be related to a weak or failing auxiliary battery?
* And if I do replace it, is there a good chance my start/stop feature will finally start working?

Sorry for the long post, but I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice or similar experiences from other W205 owners.

The Venn Diagram of people wanting to spend ¬£240/year (and it will, of course, go up) and who also want a probably AI-generated dangly freshener of their car is likely very small.

Also, delivering 4 a month means lots of postage and packaging materials, lots of transport, all for a novelty. Some people may even be put off on environmental and sustainable grounds.

Service regularly and change oil religiously before the interval.  Fix things at first sign they are not quite right.  Leaving problems on vehicles makes them much bigger than if you sorted them right away.  

Lastly and most importantly, making a vehicle last a long time has more to do with the way you drive it than anything else.  Warm it up gently and cool it down before parking it up.  Gentle gear changes with minimal clutch riding and no labouring the engine.  No sitting at lights with the clutch pressed.  

Drive it like you love it and it should be dependable for a long time.
