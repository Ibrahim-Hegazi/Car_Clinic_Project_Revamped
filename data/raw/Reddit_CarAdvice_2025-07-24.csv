1m7kz49,2008 Toyota Matrix P0138,"I recently replaced my upstream O2 sensor about 5 months ago because it was stuck lean. I replaced the sensor with a non oem brand, but not the sketchy looking ones you can get on amazon at least. I am now getting code PO138. I know this could be caused by either sensor, but I'm wondering if i just need to go ahead and get the Denso brand sensor for the recently replaced upstream sensor. I know toyota can be picky about sensors, but I tried to be cheap the first time. I do have a code reader that I can watch the live data. Are there certain parameters I can watch to determine if the issue is with the upstream or downstream sensor before I get the Denso sensor this time around?",1,1753304153.0,2,MechanicAdvice,1753384568,2025-07-23 20:55:53,2025-07-24 19:16:08,"lampministrator (Score: 2): A 138 code ONLY applies to the rear (downstream) sensor and is 95% of the time a faulty sensor.  You can watch your upstream trims and if they look good -- A healthy rear sensor should read below .09V -- You can test that with a multimeter, and if it shows that it's higher than that, it's an indication the sensor has failed, being that the fuel is, in fact, not running rich.

And I use Denso sensors all the time.  If Bosch is close enough in price I'll go that route, but it's usually more expensive.  O2 sensors aren't rocket science internally, it's a pretty rudimentary sensor...  Any brand really should do, but I personally stick with Denso if I can."

1m7kj33,"Trying out a new mechanic, is this normal?","I wanted to break away from the local dealer so i took my car into a local shop. It's having AC issues so seemed like an easy non-critical thing to try them out with. 

It was blowing cold for like 10-15 minutes and then petering out to just coolish air for any longer drives. They tested it and said it had zero pressure in the system, did a vacuum test which showed it held a vacuum. They added dye and refrigerant and found it was blowing ice cold inside. The dye showed a condenser leak. 

A couple unusual things: 
1. they say there was no pressure on initial test...i was expecting something, otherwise how was my AC working at all? I had it blasting cold air when i dropped it off. 
2. picked up my car about an hour after they finished and the AC only blows hot as duck now. I was expecting the recharge to last me a little while. 

Are they ducking with me? I could totally see them having de-charged the system to get me back in faster for the follow up work. Unless the vacuum/dye test or recharge drastically exacerbated what was a minor leak and the refrigerant just all poured out immediately afterwards.

i'm annoyed they're booked up for 2 weeks before i can get it fixed and now my AC is totally ducked. but that's how it goes i guess. 

(since when does reddit not let you use the f word?)

edit - i would like to say my gut tells me to give these guys the benefit of the doubt. I suspect the tech notes were overly brief e.g. 'no pressure' could mean not enough pressure to pass the test. I am a little concerned that there's more than just a leak going on though. like maybe there was a very slow leak but that's not what is giving me the issue.",0,1753303104.0,9,MechanicAdvice,1753384568,2025-07-23 20:38:24,2025-07-24 19:16:08,"lampministrator (Score: 5): Nope .. For most shops it's standard operating procedure to not charge a system that is leaking.  It's actually part of the certification -- You agree to adhere to EPA laws, state and local environmental laws etc etc .. Which include not releasing refrigerant into the the environment.  They are not fucking with you.  They evacuated your system and closed it up so that no more refrigerant could leak out.  What little refrigerant you had in the system is now safely tucked away in a collection tank until you get the condenser fixed and they can properly charge your system. 

OK That said ...  A leak would not (in my opinion) produce the problem you are experiencing.  Where it would consistently run cool to start and slowly warm up.  This tells me the the condenser might be getting ""warmed"" by something or the condenser fan might be failing.  A faulty expansion valve could cause this as well.  Also a weak variable duty compressor that has a weak ""Max Duty Cycle"" could also cause this.  A leak is a leak, and the system would eventually reach 0psi across both sides, making the AC completely inop.  I fail to see how a leak could cause the long standing symptoms you were experiencing. 

So while I understand why they evacuated your system, I don't understand their findings after troubleshooting.  But there is always more to the story so I could be missing key information as well ..  Take it all in with a grain of salt.

dieseltechie1991 (Score: 2): Yea something seems off the car definitely had some refridgeant in it if the ac system was making any cool air.

Did the new condensor fail or has a leaking line seal?
You need to test the low side pressure.

Also they aren't lying with a bad condensor could cause warm ac air after 20 minutes. Normally revving the engine at idle or driving the car on highway can confirm a bad condensor.  Clutch fan or electric fan may not providing enough cfms at idle to compensate cooling condensor.  Could be condensor clutch fan or orifice tube sounds like a high side restriction issue.

1m7kenu,My mechanic destroyed my engine block threads. Says it may become more expensive.,"I took my car to my mechanic to change a spark plug and repair a thermostat housing leak in my 2007 f150 4.6.

He told me he has to change all of the spark plugs and the intake manifold (which I don't think was actually necessary).

He could barely get the nuts out for the manifold, and ended up COMPLETELY destroying one of the theards, to the point where it can't even be threaded again because the side is cut out...

Now he tells me it may end up being another $1500.

My perspective is NOTHING was actually wrong with the thread itself, though I understand it was badly seized, it wasn't broken.

He could see damage coming from a mile away, and didn't ask if I wanted him to continue but instead proceeded to damage the thread of a very expensive part.

Also, he's had the car for over two weeks now... I can't see how he could manage to do that? 

Now we may be from the original $600 quote to around $2600.

I don't have faith in him right now and I'm considering towing it to a more professional shop.

Also, it doesn't seem fair that I should have to pay that much more after he didn't consult me be about something he knew he was slowly destroying; the threads of a very expensive part...

1m7j4gq,I need an A/C doctor for diagnosis help,"2010 Honda Civic

TLDR: My compressor clutch seems to turn off randomly, and stay off for a random amount of time. This has been a multi-year journey trying to diagnose the root problem, so I am trying to gather a little more information. 

**Assuming there is no leak in the A/C system, and the compressor is brand new, what are all the things that could cause a compressor clutch to turn off, and stay off for a random amount of time (sometimes minutes, sometimes days) before coming back on?** 

**My current theory is that an old and clogged condenser is causing the freon pressure to go wonky which is causing the clutch to turn off, which then further messes up the freon pressure.** 

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**



**Background** every time I’ve had the A/C recharged or looked at in any way, the air blows a little colder and the A/C seems to last longer before the clutch shuts off, but the performance gradually gets worse, and the clutch stays off longer and longer. I would have sworn this means a leak, but after 3 trips to the mechanic, no leaks have been found. 

  
So now here is all the extra information of what I’ve tried, what I still plan to try, and what I suspect: 



* 6 years ago my A/C entirely stopped working. I brought it to a mechanic who replaced the compressor with one from a junked Civic and he called it a day. It worked but it was never as cold as it used to be. 



* 2 years after that, the A/C got warmer and warmer and eventually started to fully cut out for 30 minutes at a time. I noticed the compressor clutch wasn’t turning. 



* I brought it to a better mechanic who checked for leaks and said he couldn’t find any, topped off the charge. The A/C was nice and cold and not cutting out for about a month. Performance got worse, then cutting out started happening again, until it was virtually never working. 



* I tested the relays. I changed the cabin filter. I inspected the evaporator looking for pooling water. Mechanic performed a pressure check. 



* I started to suspect that because the first mechanic didn’t replace the receiver drier or condenser, some contaminant was putting stress on the system and forcing the clutch off somehow. I asked my mechanic if I should replace the compressor, condenser, and drier. He insisted on just the compressor even though I wanted to do the compressor, condenser, drier, and expansion valve.



* Bought a new OEM compressor, system evacuated, no metal shavings or contaminant found, new compressor put in. Bliss! Working A/C! Nice and cold! For 3 weeks. Now all the old problems are back, and as of today, the A/C cycled off with the compressor clutch not spinning, and it’s been that way for 2 days. I hear the RPS surge and the system engage, but the clutch doesn’t start spinning. **The last thing I will try is jumping the power to the compressor to make sure it’s functional. If it is, something higher up the chain must be sending it the signal to shut off and stay off - but why? And how does that relate to the A/C quality gradually degrading?** 



**Could it be…**



A faulty pressure switch? - it fits some of the symptoms, like the clutch not spinning sometimes. But it doesn’t explain the gradual decline in QUALITY of the A/C temp, which seems linked to how often the Clutch stops. 

Clogged expansion valve?

Under or overcharged? Unlikely, it’s been charged and recharged so many times how would different mechanics all mess it up the same way?

Engine temp sensor too high, ECU cutout for overheat protection?

Faulty wiring / bad a-c clutch coil?  


I’m going to try replacing the pressure switches myself and see if that solves the problem. Then I’m going to try replacing the temp sensors (though that seems more complicated and expensive). If none of those work, I feel like my only option is to go back to my mechanic and insist on a FULL replacement of the compressor, valve, condenser, drier. I’m tempted to seek out an A/C specialist to triple check for leaks. ",1,1753299903.0,15,MechanicAdvice,1753384568,2025-07-23 19:45:03,2025-07-24 19:16:08,"A925D (Score: 2): You have a leak.

1m7gw6w,08 Acura MDX-no power,"Hello everyone, first time posting. 

I am not mechanically inclined when it comes to cars,, I'll start there.

I have a 2008 Acura MDX that is not getting power. The alternator, battery and terminal clamps are all new within 3 months.
I drove my car to the store yesterday after work with no issue, did my shopping for a few minutes and my car would not start. I did not have power locks working, dash lights, any electrical. 
First thing I checked was to make sure the terminal clamps were secured. They were. 
I tried jumping it with a box and a good Samaritan who had cables to no avail. 

I let my jump box stay on for a couple of minutes and I got my doors to open with the fob but there was nothing when I went to start it. 
I took the battery out and brought it to Advance Auto Parts where everything checked out on their test. 12.6 volts while resting, etc. 

The main fuse looked okay after pulling it out. 

Does anyone have any advice on what to check next prior to calling Triple A and having it towed to the shop?

Thank you!!

If you were able to get some indication of electricity, like the doors opening with the fob, then there is a chance you might have needed it to charge longer. I experienced the same thing with my MDX. 

Maybe give it a bit longer than you think you would need, that way you have full flexibility.

This assumes it is in overall average mechanical condition and isn't too rusty.  Rust may or may not be an issue, depending on where the car was in the winter (road salt vs. no road salt).  The transmissions in these are average or better, and if you change the fluid it should last quite some time still.

It will probably have either the 3100 or 3400 V6, not the 3800 which was in the full size cars.  These are still pretty solid motors - with 2 caveats.  The first is the intake manifold gasket can leak, allowing coolant into the engine (it gets sucked in through the intake) which creates lots of steam out the exhaust.  People call this ""white smoke"" and assume the head gaskets are gone, but it might just be the intake gasket.  The second caveat is these engines can also have head gasket issues if the coolant hasn't been changed on schedule. The good news is, the head gaskets are easier to replace than on most cars, because this is a pushrod Overhead Valve engine.  

They made lots of these cars and other models also sold by Chevy and Pontiac, so it is easy to get parts and service.  You could get a pre-purchase inspection to be sure it is worth the money.  You can go look at the car first, and if it seems decent arrange the inspection, or just talk to the dealer on the phone and arrange someone to do the inspection (will cost $100 to $150) before you go.  Depends on how hard it is to get to the other town vs. how much you don't mind spending $100 to have someone say  ""don't buy this car""."

I love this stupid car, even if it isn't perfect, but it keeps going into limp mode. We've replaced all the sensors on the 5V rail, we've replaced the ECU, and it keeps tripping. So the mechanic I was taking it to - who has always been a good guy to me, has always been up front, has always worked with me well, just says, look, I can test for if the current gets from point A to point B, but I can't scope it - I can't look at the waveform, and I can't run a CONSULT scan on it to take that waveform data and see where the fault is so we're not just blindly replacing parts. So it takes 2 days of me calling shops, with many shops just telling me a CONSULT scan isn't real and many not understanding when I request a quote for an oscilloscope and then sometimes they'll let me speak to the mechanic or sometimes they won't, I finally get a shop that agrees to scope it for twice the diagnostic rate of every other shop around. It's a dealership. Maybe I should've known better. But they do pre owned, they do collision, they were very nice to me at the beginning. 

  
Then they called back and said that I need to replace all of the parts I've already replaced because they're not new from the factory. I'm like... I agreed to do this diag and to do it at your shop with the understanding that I was paying 2x the rate so that you could look at the waveform of how the electricity was moving through this system and pinpoint the problem instead of me throwing money at replacing parts endlessly - so that you could give me the results of the CONSULT and the waveform and tell me precisely what's wrong, not just ""you have coke and I want pepsi to move forward"", and they basically told me I'll have to replace all the sensors, the ECU, and the wiring harness, AND THEN they'll run the CONSULT scan.

  
Am I being an AH? Am I talking out of my \*\*\*??? Do I not know what I'm saying?

  
I'm not a mechanic, so I'm not sure if I'm that stroke patient who's angry that you're not treating their gallbladder with leeches... am I just misinformed? I keep trying to talk to the mechanic so I know what's actually happening and have ChatGPT explain it to me, but they're acting like they can't even run a scope on a part that isn't factory. Is that actually a thing? Do scopes only work with certain parts? It makes no sense to me that that would be the case. They're supposed to have this fancy computer that can see the waveform of the current regardless of what sticker is on a part and tell me which one is faulty, that's the whole reason I agreed to go there and pay $400 instead of $200...

  
Alright, I'll stop ranting. Sorry. Anyway. They want $8k to redo the work I've already done plus a harness. Which I guess isn't an awful quote for 5 sensors, the ECU, and the harness.

It does not apply to to a degas style system.  A degas system will have a pressure cap on it vice a plain non-pressure cap on the reservoir. 

The system uses the vacuum created by the reduction in volume of the coolant as it cools to pull back in from the reservoir the coolant that was pushed out when the coolant expanded while heating up.  

Several parts need to be working correctly for this to work.  
- The radiator cap has a check valve which must be working.  
- The radiator cap must have a good seal in two places on the radiator (there are 2 separate rubber seals)
- The hose to the reservoir must fit tight and not leak on the radiator neck nipple. 
- The hose must not have any age cracks 
- The reservoir end of hose must be near the bottom of the reservoir tank and below the level of the coolant to siphon the coolant back to the radiator.


And finally:  The radiator must be full or near full.  When the radiator has no air in it, shrinkage of the coolant creates an immediate strong vacuum to pull the coolant back in.  If the coolant level in the radiator is low, then the air pocket in the top of the radiator easily expands as the coolant creates a vacuum and the amount of vacuum is weaker.  Once the radiator level drops low enough, then no coolant can be pulled back in as the system cools off. 

How low can the radiator coolant level be is highly variable from vehicle to vehicle and depends on the volume of the cooling system as well as the height difference between the top of the radiator and the coolant level in the reservoir.

I’ve noticed the first time about a month ago when I took a longer drive and the car started warning me that the coolant was low. I chalked it up to the mileage (100k miles), because I thought that it had happened slowly over time, filled the reservoir up with the correct coolant and continued on my merry way.

Now, approximately 500 miles later, I’ve noticed that the coolant is noticeably lower than when I refilled it and there are traces of coolant around the center “rim”-piece of the reservoir. I have another long drive (~1000 miles) coming up and won’t be making it to the mechanic before that, the car hasn’t been behaving weirdly otherwise, hasn’t been overheating, A/C works just fine and neither coolant nor oil are discoloured in any way.

* Later, I started hearing a weird noise from the hood when the car was in Drive but not moving.
   * That noise went away in Neutral.

I took it to 2 different mechanics. I *think* they didn’t find the problem (or didn’t explain well), but eventually I went back because one day it wouldn’t even go forward in 1. One of them changed *something*, and then it kinda started working again in Drive the thing he changed is the picture below. it looked like that.

But now, new problem:

* Steering wheel got super heavy. Like, I could barely turn it.
* I already knew the power steering fluid was low, but it’s been draining *fast*—like I’m refilling a whole bottle every 2 weeks for the last 2 months.
   * That never happened during the year I was driving it “for free,” so I’m like… what’s going on?

Then someone my bf knows (apparently works for a mechanic) came to check it and said:

“Yeah, it’s the transmission. You need to replace it. It’ll cost $700.”

Now I’m confused. Because before, whenever I fixed things, it cost me like $40–$100 depending on the repair. And when I *crashed* the car and dented the side so bad the door wouldn’t open, I paid **$**700 total—and that included fixing 2 doors, other stuff, and waxing the car.

So I’m like… is this accurate?? Is $700 the real price?? Is this guy trying to scam me?  
Also:

* Can I fix this myself if I figure out the exact problem? Like, can I YouTube it and DIY it if someone diagnoses it properly?
* I’m a broke bich rn so that’s why I’m even asking.
* But also I don’t know *who* to trust. A lot of mechanics in this country have a bad rep for scamming, and I don’t speak the language well, especially car terms (tbh even in English I barely understand lol).

Anyway. Advice? Reality check? Should I just try and sell this car and just get something

i should probably ask more questions (my fault), but now i feel like idk who to trust since most mechanics in this country get a bad rap of being scammers so idk like how to choose one. also i dont really speak the language of this country well enough to know car terms (tbh even in english idek).

**TL;DR:** I’ve got a 2003/4 Nissan Sunny that ran fine for a year when I was borrowing it, but after I bought it, issues started popping up. It wouldn’t move in Drive unless I put it in 1 or 2 (then i can return it to drive), and there was a weird noise from the hood that only happened in Drive when I wasn’t moving (it went away in Neutral). A mechanic eventually fixed *something* (the picture above) and it started moving in Drive again. Now the steering wheel is super stiff, and the power steering fluid is leaking fast, I have to refill it every two weeks. A guy my boyfriend knows says the transmission needs replacing and it’ll cost $700, but that feels like a lot compared to past repairs I’ve had. I don’t really understand car stuff, I don’t speak the local language well, and I’m broke, so I’m trying to figure out if this sounds accurate, if I’m being scammed, and if I can DIY any of this with help from someone who can diagnose it.

I currently don't have the possibility to remove the oil pan.

The sound changes consistently with acceleration and stays rhythmic, but I don't have any low or dropping oil pressure.

It seems to get louder as the engine warms up, which would also point toward a rod knock.

I just flushed the radiator and am waiting for the new coolant to arrive, so I can't do any further testing with the engine running until then. I plan to pull one spark plug wire at a time to see if the noise changes.

BTW, needing more rpms to accelerate is not likely to be a symptom of overfilling.

You should really be checking the oil with the dipstick and not just blindly adding X amount of oil.

The alternator output is mostly stable, with a few jumps. The entire ignition system jumps anytime the output jumps. At the very end, in the picture, when the misfire happens, the alternator output can be seen to be going up and down.

No leak to be seen just coolant pouring out from under the car. Now I have it sitting in the garage and im assuming it’s just leaked all of the coolant, every time I take the cap off more coolant leaks out however the coolant is coming out from a small hole around where the engine and transmission link additionally it seems a lot of transmission oil has leaked out.

If your steering wheel is on the piss like that it is usually a good indication that your wheel alignment needs a tickle up.

Steering wheel shaking usually means that your tyres need balancing.

Does that shaking only come on at certain speeds? i.e driving at 80kph and then disappears at 90 or is it shaking the whole time?
If it’s shaking the whole time then it is possibly something mechanical otherwise a simple balance job should sort it.

I have a problem with fresh car (11000 km/7000 miles)
Car: 2023 KIA Seltos 1.5L (CVT, China build)
Bought August 2024. 
Installed aftermarket alarm system  StarlineE96v2 in December 2024 in official Starline shop.
April 2025 alarm system started incorrectly working when tried to remote engine start. 
April 2025 Starline shop fixed alarm system.
9 days car stayed in garage.
Then after more 10 days of driving this error started showing.

Problem:
Intermittent ABS, ESC, and Lane Safety System warnings.
	•	Warnings mostly appear after overnight parking or midday rest (1–4 hours).
	•	Sometimes disappear after driving a bit or restarting.
	•	In rare cases, the warning appears during driving (after 10–15 minutes), but mostly on startup.
	•	Never a consistent pattern.

⸻

Error Codes (stored or current when warning appears):
	•	C1622-11 – Lateral G Sensor: Open or Short
	•	C1622-92 – Lateral G Sensor: Performance problem
	•	Sometimes additional codes related to Yaw Rate Sensor
	•	All four ABS wheel speed sensors show valid readings when scanned

⸻

Actions Taken:
	•	Cleaned ABS ground point with WD-40
	•	Added a dedicated ground wire from ABS unit to chassis
	•	Checked alternator: stable voltage (13.38–13.49V under load)
	•	Measured ground resistance (multimeter): all under 0.03 Ω
	•	Used contact cleaner on connectors
	•	No visible wire damage, no corrosion
	•	Can’t access ABS main plug easily without major disassembly

⸻

Background:
	•	Installed aftermarket alarm system
	•	Right after installation, the car was left parked for 9 days
	•	The issue started about 10 days later, without any changes in driving conditions

⸻

Question:
Could the aftermarket alarm interfere with ABS or sensor signals and cause these errors?
Or is it more likely a ground/power issue in the ABS or sensor circuits?

1m71ifl,05 gs430 timing belt snapped,"Now I’ve done some oil changes and brakes before and was too afraid to do my timing belt and put it off because I’m no mechanic. And it was over due at 110k miles.

I was on the highway and lost all power. Pulled over, had my cheap $30 obd2 scanner on me and waited for AAA and if I remember correct it was cam and crank shaft sensor codes. I get it home and pop the hood next morning. The radiator is blown with fluid everywhere dried. 

Figured cool I get a new radiator and we’re back in business, ordered new hoses too. (Again keep in mind I’m a total noob) put the new radiator in and no start, so I opened up the left cam cover and saw my timing belt was snapped. 

Mind you I was using ChatGPT/youtube to do all my work and talking to chat gpt for a few days it was saying my engine is not an interference so I don’t have to worry about valves/pistons hitting. Did the whole timing belt job, made sure both cams line up when crank is back to tdc while hand cranking it. Tried to start after all that work and no start misfire in 8.

At this point I was frustrated and double checked on Google and realize my engine is definitely an interference aka I found out what the i in vvti stands for now…. Having been on adhd meds for the first time for a month now I decided to tackle the valve job even though I barely know how to wrench. 

Now I’m deep in the trenches but for the past week or two  Ive basically done 3 radiator jobs, 2 timing belts and now fixing valves…. On a v8… I just reached and removed the right cam head today and found 2 exhaust valves leaking (also saw them score light marks on the head of the piston 6) so I removed those 2 valves and also noticed 1 intake leaking on cylinder 8. 

Now my main question for all the real mechanics is since I’m using ChatGPT/google ai as my garage buddy it’s stating that even those slight scoring that the valves left on the aluminum pistons can create issue down the line with hot spots and make the piston go kaboom in the future especially since I drive hard/fast/stupid I was just wondering how true this is and do I really have to worry about it? Or can I just do my valve job and get my damn car back on the road again?  I still need to remove the left cam and check all of those valves was hoping pistons should be fine? Or do I really have to worry about those slight scoring from the valves? And any other tips or tricks for me? 

I’ve learned a whole lot in the past week and after knowing how involved this damn valve job is, will never let my timing or other maintenance down again…. Ive gained a whole lot of knowledge, lots of new tools and just hope I can get her running again. And ps I did lock the exhaust scissor gear before removing the cams! What also took me so long is making sure I unbolted everything in the correct order and only quarter turn loosening at a time in the reverse pattern over and over till things like cams, head and valve cover came off hopefully not warped.

TLDR
I can't tell if the spot is oil by touch sight or smell, my dipstick shows low oil but I could be stupid because I usually don't get consistent reads.

I found this big spot under my car today, I put my finger in it and I can't tell if the color of the liquid is dark/brown or it just looks that way because of the dirt on the ground. I smelled it and I think it might smell like oil but it's faint, could it just be the smell from the ground? I looked under my hood and my dipstick showed low, but I took my car to the mechanic June 27 because i got rear ended and my brake wasn't fully engaging and I was afraid I had a coolant leak and AC issues and my oil was low even though they changed my oil around may 15, they said that I did have a coolant leak and my rear right caliper needed to be replaced and my ac might have an evaporator leak, they didn't see anything for an oil leak though and gave me a quart to top it off and said to keep an eye on it, it had been very inconsistent and I might be stupid and can't read the dipstick properly, sometimes it read low on one side and full on the other, sometimes there was a dry spot in the middle with oil around the low and around the high but nothing in the middle, I have to drive an hour and a half away Thursday for my daughter's doctor's appointment, am I fine to just add another quart for now or do I need to bring it tomorrow to the shop because I also have work in the morning.

Image 1: it's dark and it's the only image of the puddle. Personally my first thought was oil, coolant, or both. If you put some water on it and you see a rainbow, it has oil in it. Alternatively, you can put a clean white absorbent shear (my shop calls them ""diapers"") and set it under to see if you can't get a better color view since you say you can't tell if it's dirt or oil.

Image 2: again especially after looking up the engine it's hard to tell where that's coming from. I'd recommend cleaning it off with a can of brake cleaner and wiping it down and seeing where the leaks coming from specifically.

Image 3: that looks like a power steering hose but please someone correct me if I'm wrong. From the images I found it looks like that connects to the power steering reservoir but I was also looking at it from top side.

Short of it is basically clean it up a bit before running it to see where and what it is, keep an eye on your fluid levels so you know what exactly is leaking at what speed, and maybe find something that can catch the stuff hitting the ground so you can get a better idea of it's color to give and get a better idea of what is being looked at"

Personally, I'd take a gander at your coolant- see whether it looks like chocolate milkshake. While you're in there, best to snap a picture & share it here. If you're not familiar with such, ***research how to do so safely***. The short version: *check it while it's cold*. Popping the cap while the system is under pressure & hot can result in severe burns.

Not a big deal, but a minor annoyance. I am very confident after research that I just need to replace the radiator Surge Tank. There is a service bulletin on this problem that seems to exactly describe my problem (TSB 10183165).  

On the surface it seems to be a very straightforward .  Seems like I just need to remove the hoses, remove two bolts and try not to spill coolant everywhere in the process.  Reverse the process for the replacement tank I'll order from GM.

Are there other steps or considerations I need to make?  I don't think I need to flush the radiator right? One of those things that I want to make sure I don't miss an important step.

I've not taken it to the shop for this issue because most of my trips are short (barring rush hours from work in which case I can predict what hwy exit my AC will stop working at) and because I don't want to pay for a diagnostic issues when they won't be able to recreate the problem unless driving the car on a hot day for at least 20 or 25 minutes.

I looked it up and there are lawsuits and recalls for the eyesight system. Looks like from 2013-2021.
If thats the case you should be able to get the dealer to take care of it for free.

If you have a printer you should print out the recall notice and take a copy with you just in case they try to charge you if its an Eyesight system problem. Usually most major dealerships are pretty honest. Their dealerships are usually covered for recalls. Still though Ive known of people that had to fight with the dealership over charges.

I have a **2015 VW Tiguan (2.0 TSI)** that’s been giving me trouble. Here's the full timeline of what’s happened:

# 🔍 What happened:

* Yesterday while merging on the highway, the car **hesitated hard** when accelerating, then **EPC and Check Engine lights** came on, felt like there was no power when I was holding the gas
* Drove it home - ran rough, but still started later in the day
* Today it started once at 2PM, but now it **cranks with no ignition at all (attached video)**

# 📋 Codes I pulled:

* **P0300**, **P0303**, **P0304** — misfires on cylinders 3 &amp; 4 (2,3,4/4)
* **P2404** — EVAP system leak detection pump sensor (1/4)
* **P053F** — fuel economy mode switch/performance

# 🧰 What I’ve done so far:

* **Swapped ignition coils** between cylinders 1 and 3 - misfire code **did not move**
* Boosted the car - still no start
* Tried a **battery reset** (disconnected for 15 mins) - still cranks but no ignition
* Inspected all visible connections - all plugged in

# 🤔 Next steps I’m planning:

* Spray test: going to spray starting fluid into the throttle body to check if it fires
* Check for spark / fuel delivery
* Possibly replace spark plugs 
* Inspect crankshaft position sensor or fuel pump fuse/relay

# 💬 Any ideas?

Has anyone experienced a **no-start like this immediately following EPC + misfire codes**?  
Could the **fuel pump or crank sensor** fail suddenly like this?  
Would the **ECU block fuel/spark** after persistent misfires?

Well, After buying it, the transmission won’t allow me to go past 40mph. When the transmission is cold, I have reverse and I have manual mode and I can go highway speeds for about 5 minutes before it does the same thing again and I can’t go past 40, and aswell I lose reverse and manual mode. 
I just changed the transmission fluid, and well it was brown, but it was not sparkly and did not smell burnt. It is throwing a P0746 code (Solenoid A). Basically I am wondering what My best option is here, and I will list the options I have down below.

Carfax tells me that ATF was changed at 85k right before I bought it 20 years ago. Have never changed the fluid (D’oh!) 

For the age old debate (or unanswerable question) about whether you should drain and fill (never flush) or “leave it” for a car whose ATF hasn’t been changed in 200+k mikes — here’s what the fluid from the dipstick looks like. Does this give me any hope that it might work out, since it’s not darker and doesn’t smell burnt? 

The darker smudges on the towel are probably oil because the bottom of my engine bay has some oil residue from a leak that I’ve partially fixed. 

I have recently fixed a few things up and I’m enjoying driving it again after I let it sit for a while . I guess I’m also kind of looking for things to fix to keep it on the road longer, so I definitely don’t want to have the transmission explode if I change a percentage of the fluid once or twice. 

There are a few somewhat clunky shifts here and there, but for the most part, it’s running pretty great for how old it is. Ive never driven too aggressively (though it has been in a few fender benders) 

Also, bonus question, does the car have to be raised and flat for a drain and fill or can it be done on ramps?  (If I decide to risk ruining my car and changing some of the ATF)

Jacking the car up again, there's no noticably different noise between the 2 wheels when rotating them with the car in neutral (only slightly pad drag). Neither wheel has any play or noise when rocking it up and down or side to side. 

I'm tempted to believe I replaced the wrong bearing, but I'm struggling to convince myself it actually would be the other (left) wheel bearing causing this.

I don't know if this helps, but sitting in the passenger or driver's seat, when turning left, the noise sounds like it gets louder on that side of the vehicle - doesn't sound side specific.

If the car isn't being driven, the fade seems to be less dramatic. But even when it's blowing its hardest, the airflow still feels weak.

If I turn the dial to a mid speed, it will run at that speed as well before fading. Additionally, after fading, sometimes it will come back on in a burst before fading again. When turned on, the blower takes about 2 seconds before kicking in, and there's a clicking noise that sounds like the fan speeding up but goes away once it reaches speed.

I checked the voltage of the wire that plugs into the blower motor, and the voltage is stable. When the dial is off, or at any of the speeds, it stays at 11.92/13.46 V (for accessory mode/engine on). When the dial is at its highest setting and the MAX button is on, then it's 12.60/14.15 V.

I have a 2014 Mini Cooper Clubman S. The AC has been dead for a while due to a leak in the condenser. I replaced the condenser myself since that isn't too bad to access on my own. Unfortunately broke a bolt on the double piping on the side of the condenser and couldn't fully seal the system back up. Took it to a local well rated garage and asked if they could extract the bolt, then pull vacuum and recharge the system, or failing that replace the part with the broken bolt.

Bolt couldn't be extracted so I got the serial number off the part and ordered a new one. Had them put it back together so I could at least get back to work and all just without AC until the part came in. When I got into work the next day and parked the fan came on as I shut the engine off and made a horrible grinding noise, took it to the garage around the corner from work they got it on the lift and told me the flexible hoses going to the condenser weren't attached to anything and got into the fan. Also found many bolts and pins in the bumper missing. Immediately ask the original garage what is going on. They at least offer to make it right and I was willing to give the benefit of the doubt since it was like 5oclock on Saturday.

Eventually took it back in today once I got the new part and asked them to put it in and recharge AC. They told me it was done and good. Then called 15 minutes later to say it's still blowing hot actually even though vacuum is good and the compressor was turning on. Then told me there's a battery issue and apparently the alternator is dead. I'm absolutely done with this place by now so pick it up and drive home, start hearing a squeaking sound as well on the way home that increases as it revs.

I'm lost what to do for repairs at this point, unfortunately mechanics have not even wanted to touch it since the first guys messed it up. Maybe the alternator is completely unrelated?

  if you have low fuel pressure.. what readings are you getting.
 
 i have a test that is crazy easy to perform.. 

 locate the fuel pump relay.. remove it.. see if you can access the actual relay guts inside.. examine the contacts. i find so many fuel pump relays are have burned away contacts.. 

 reinstall the bare relay.. give it a squeeze.  does the fuel pump come on...  can you hear fuel surging thru the fuel lines???

 get the truck started.. let it idle.. unplug the fuel pump relay.. does the truck still idle.. if it dies then the 3 wire oil pressure switch is bad too. . the outer 2 wires Orange and the Grey wire are Redundant power for the fuel pump only when the oil pressure is above 6 or 7 PSI.. 

 i use a 1987 Chevy S10 2.8 fuel filter as part of my fuel injection test kit.. it has the 16MM oring fitting on one side and the 5/16 hose barb on the other..   i install this for DEAD HEAD TESTING the fuel pump .. on a TBI fuel pump.. cycling the key should bring the fuel pressure instantly to 27 PSI..

 guess what.. if you have a fuel pump failure. you can install an inline pump fed from a gas can to feed the fuel filter for long enough to get you a mile or two..  the return is still going into the fuel tank. 

 please examine the ignition coil externally.. look for signs of external high voltage leaks.. 

 https://i.imgur.com/xV4tHvi.jpg like that.. you can pull the coil wire from the cap and make sure . don't hold it.. that you are getting a bright blue spark.. not a dim orange spark..

 since you have a multimeter.. get the engine started.. perform all seven tests.. .https://i.redd.it/192cdpta3zdf1.jpeg

 why test 2B.. because the fuel pump is grounded to the top of the frame rail in front of the left rear tire.. but where is the frame grounded to the negative battery?? the first 5 steps of that test take about a minute.. 

 test 5 goes to the 5 stud power distribution block on the firewall near the passenger side hood hinge.. test the ring terminals bolted to the studs.

1m7j4co,I need an A/C doctor for diagnosis help,"2010 Honda Civic

TLDR: My compressor clutch seems to turn off randomly, and stay off for a random amount of time. This has been a multi-year journey trying to diagnose the root problem, so I am trying to gather a little more information. 

**Assuming there is no leak in the A/C system, and the compressor is brand new, what are all the things that could cause a compressor clutch to turn off, and stay off for a random amount of time (sometimes minutes, sometimes days) before coming back on?** 

**My current theory is that an old and clogged condenser is causing the freon pressure to go wonky which is causing the clutch to turn off, which then further messes up the freon pressure.** 

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**



**Background** every time I’ve had the A/C recharged or looked at in any way, the air blows a little colder and the A/C seems to last longer before the clutch shuts off, but the performance gradually gets worse, and the clutch stays off longer and longer. I would have sworn this means a leak, but after 3 trips to the mechanic, no leaks have been found. 

  
So now here is all the extra information of what I’ve tried, what I still plan to try, and what I suspect: 



* 6 years ago my A/C entirely stopped working. I brought it to a mechanic who replaced the compressor with one from a junked Civic and he called it a day. It worked but it was never as cold as it used to be. 



* 2 years after that, the A/C got warmer and warmer and eventually started to fully cut out for 30 minutes at a time. I noticed the compressor clutch wasn’t turning. 



* I brought it to a better mechanic who checked for leaks and said he couldn’t find any, topped off the charge. The A/C was nice and cold and not cutting out for about a month. Performance got worse, then cutting out started happening again, until it was virtually never working. 



* I tested the relays. I changed the cabin filter. I inspected the evaporator looking for pooling water. Mechanic performed a pressure check. 



* I started to suspect that because the first mechanic didn’t replace the receiver drier or condenser, some contaminant was putting stress on the system and forcing the clutch off somehow. I asked my mechanic if I should replace the compressor, condenser, and drier. He insisted on just the compressor even though I wanted to do the compressor, condenser, drier, and expansion valve.



* Bought a new OEM compressor, system evacuated, no metal shavings or contaminant found, new compressor put in. Bliss! Working A/C! Nice and cold! For 3 weeks. Now all the old problems are back, and as of today, the A/C cycled off with the compressor clutch not spinning, and it’s been that way for 2 days. I hear the RPS surge and the system engage, but the clutch doesn’t start spinning. **The last thing I will try is jumping the power to the compressor to make sure it’s functional. If it is, something higher up the chain must be sending it the signal to shut off and stay off - but why? And how does that relate to the A/C quality gradually degrading?** 



**Could it be…**



A faulty pressure switch? - it fits some of the symptoms, like the clutch not spinning sometimes. But it doesn’t explain the gradual decline in QUALITY of the A/C temp, which seems linked to how often the Clutch stops. 

Clogged expansion valve?

Under or overcharged? Unlikely, it’s been charged and recharged so many times how would different mechanics all mess it up the same way?

Engine temp sensor too high, ECU cutout for overheat protection?

Faulty wiring / bad a-c clutch coil?  


I’m going to try replacing the pressure switches myself and see if that solves the problem. Then I’m going to try replacing the temp sensors (though that seems more complicated and expensive). If none of those work, I feel like my only option is to go back to my mechanic and insist on a FULL replacement of the compressor, valve, condenser, drier. I’m tempted to seek out an A/C specialist to triple check for leaks.

Think of the ac as two different systems: the mechanical and the electrical. 

The mechanical is where you seem to be stuck and is the majority of AC problems and what most AC techs deal with all summer. Its the compressor, drier, expansion valve, orifice tube, etc. 

The electrical side is what's controlling the AC compressor. This is the computer and climate control strategies that dictate when the AC compressor is off and on. This is the pressure sensors, computer, wires, and varies other sensors and control units that can have an effect on AC. 

I suspect that the mechanical side is good as multiple techs over multiple years has gone over this. So my guess is this is a control side (electrcal) issue. There are outside things that can be interfering here. Things like the sun load sensor, pressure sensors, evaporator freeze up sensor, interior temperature sensor, engine load calculations, engine temperature, AC relay, AC condesor fan, and automatic climate control programming can all interfere with your AC. 

Start with the easy stuff and work to the harder. Take the AC relay out and swap it with an identical relay thats already in the car controlling another system. If both relays are good, nothing happens, if ones bad then the other system will start having problems or your AC will stop having problems. 

Can you see the inside and outside temps on your dash? Is one of them weird or completely wrong? That will tell you if one of the temp sensors is bad. 

Does the AC fan kick on when you have the ac on and the car sitting at idle? It should and can cause pressure issues if not. Is the condenser full of leaves, dirt, a plastic bag, etc? This will cause pressure issues again. 

Try covering the sun load sensor (little black ball thing on the dash) with a rag. See what changes, if any, the ac makes. This won't tell you if the sensor is good or bad, but if your ac changes it is probably OK. If it doesnt, then it doesnt really mean anything. 

After this you start needing thermometers, manifold guages, a multimeter and scan tools. You will basically confirm all the sensor data manually, check the wiring, and then drive around with everything hooked up and waiting for it to act up so you can see what is not reading correctly. If everything is reading correctly then you start looking at the computers outputs rule it in or out.

As a general rule don’t use junked cars A/C parts in cars since theres no telling what the previous owner did. First off Id check your wiring to rule out any electrical faults that can be happening. Then Id replace all the components (compressor, condenser, evaporator, valve and hoses with new orings too) this is a pain to do but it also gives you the opportunity to see if the hoses can be reused and the pressure sensors are good too outside of the vehicle.

1m74rwo,"Almost 2 months, 4 mechanics and 800 euros...for a single wire.","I wish the title was clickbait or an overstatement, but sadly it's not. As my odyssey is (hopefully) coming to a close, i decided to post here, to both help some poor soul that might have similar problems, or hear about other people's stories. 

I have a 2004 1.6L Suzuki Grand Vitara, bought from the original owner three years ago with 180k km, currently at 240k km. I kept up with services and basic maintenance (oil changes, cooler top-ups) and generally hadn't had any issues. 

The whole ordeal starts around end of May, about two weeks after a full service. Car starts shaking and ""kicking"", which I would eventually google about and learn the terms ""rough idling"" and ""misfires"". I take it to my mechanic, he tells me I need new coils. Alright, no problem, although I'm a little suspicious he didn't catch anything at the last service. 

The coils work for two full days before issues start again. At the same time, my mechanic tells me he is leaving on holiday and can't work on my car. I try to wait until he's back (cause at this point I still trust his professionalism), but the misfiring gets so bad I decide to visit another shop. 

Long story short, in the time he was gone I visited three other mechanics, getting increasingly worried about the issue not getting properly diagnosed, let alone solved. The first told me that it's faulty coils and he doesn't have time to change them until a week later (????), second cleared my throttle (which was absolutely gross) and sent me on my way. Third one was the first person to actually take the time to work on the car properly. 

Turns out my original mechanic wasn't servicing the car correctly, if he did at all. There was dirt on and in everything (carbon/oil deposits and stains?), and tons of internal rust. I spent countless hours with Mechanic n.3 dissasembling and cleaning and flushing. After that the car starter feeling better, but original issues hadn't been resolved. We change the spark plus with original suzuki ones (aka a small fortune), then coils and coil wiring. Issues persist and I'm losing my mind at this point, as it's my only car, finances are tight, and I cannot work without it. 

I had been trying to find a pattern, as the engine light would sometimes go off, then turn on again. Car would drive smoothly for a while, then randomly misfiring would start again. The only constant was that aircondition would worsen everything, and misfires would be more intense at roundabouts. I also had instances of the car dying while taking sharp turns. 

Yesterday, after days of having to go to work in the car equivalent of riding a mechanical bull, with no aircondition at a 43C weather, I go back to the mechanic for another go. He is sure it's a) engine and b) electrical related, but seems very distressed as all individual parts are either brand new or seem to work correctly. Through this whole ordeal, the only code we get is ""random cylinder misfire"" which is zero help. 

He calls a friend over to help brainstorm while I'm thinking of how I could possibly sell the car and take out a loan for a new one with less than 100e on my name. His friend then bends over the open hood, and triumphantly pulls something out from the depths of the space behind the engine. The wire that supplies engine components with electricity. Which is worn to hell and back. He demonstrates how the engine runs smoothly if it's bend correctly and how it misfires when it's not. Literally like a shitty wired earbud. Tells us this must be the sole issue. And it was.

A singular wire which took twenty minutes, some tape and pliers and now there's no engine light, no misfire and I can run my aircon as high as I want. It would be kind of funny if it hadnt been chipping away at my sanity for weeks.

I just got it scanned today and the same code popped up as the last time I scanned it a year and a half ago. Something about my turbocharger. Can that be what’s causing the smoking?

Because of the smoke, it's likely that the turbo is on its way out. It's likely that the turbo is not spooling and developing/holding pressure. Regardless, oil from the turbo is being ingested into the intake and being burned. This is bad for the catalytic converter and other important components.

Safe to drive for another week until you fix it? No.

Other comments have pointed out an extended warranty bulletin for this particular motor, so try your luck at the dealership. Free 99 is a good price if possible.

Your alignment looks as good as it can be without fixing the rear. It could be a case where the tech thought they had set it straight but it was slightly cockeyed. It happens.


Does it drift when you intentionally steer the wheel perfectly straight or does it drift when you let the car just drive? Meaning your hands are on the wheel but you're not giving any steering input. You are supposed to have a very slight drift to the right.

1m73kag,2009 WRX Wheel Bearings,"Hi, everyone!

First post here and relatively new to participating in car community activities.....

I've had my 2019 Subaru WRX for about a year and a half.   
About 3 months ago I noticed a droning sound at about 55mph. 

It is speed dependent, not rev dependent. 

My first thought was a wheel bearing failure. 

Panic having been induced, I took it to my usual shop and they found nothing when they jacked it up. 

I've since taken it to 3 different shops and they all test drove her, saying they heard it too but couldn't determine where it was coming from. 

Nothing wobbles when it's on the jack. 

Brakes are good, but I'm getting vibration under hard braking from higher speeds (freeway exits and the like). 

In the last couple weeks the droning has gotten louder so I took it back to my usual guys today.

Admittedly I had a bit of a laundry list today. 

Again they said it's tire noise and nothing was out of sorts.

My shifter didn't feel loose to them on the test drive (asked if they could tighten a bearing or something...), alignment is fine, and I effectively fist fucked myself by charging my own AC with the wrong stuff. 

All this to say....

Are they trying to fuck me by waiting until this gets worse and they can capitalize on 4 bearings instead of one or something?

I want to trust Jarrod, but I wanted this car when it came out in 2015 and worked my ass off to get it and now I need to know if I'm being neurotic or if I'm getting played.

1m7axy8,2020 blazer with an endless list of issues,"I originally leased my 2020 blazer brand new and had no issues at all during my 3 year leasing term. I ended up buying out my lease after 3 years and OF COURSE thats when all the trouble started...

Where on earth do I even start!? First it started saying ESC and ""Steering assist reduced. Drive with care."" When that started, the steering became really stiff and damn near every light on the dashboard lit up (engine, battery, etc). At the same time, my AC started not blowing out cold air, and the fan on the car was really loud. I had it checked out and was told that I had a crack in the container that holds the coolant in the car, and that my blazer basically went into ""panic mode"" due to being low on coolant. Had the coolant container replaced, and all was well for a little while. 

  
Fast forward to about a month later, all the same issues started again, but this time with MORE problems to add to the list....

 Now to save myself from not making this post miles and miles long, I'm not going to keep going into a ton of detail and explaining everything in order I'll just list everything I've experienced thus far with my blazer. Basically, it started glitching out everywhere.... 

\- The parking break light now randomly goes on for no reason at all. 

\- The radio screen will black out sometimes. 

\- Sometimes the AC/Heat will turn on, but not light up or let me control it or turn it off. 

\- The car will stall out at red lights or any stops and quickly restart (different than the auto stop/start feature). 

\- The keyfob will not always recognize. Thought the battery was dead/low in the keyfob, so I replaced it and that did nothing. It will makes me put the keyfob into the cupholder (where the transmitter pocket is) in order to recognize it and start the engine up.

\- Engine hesitates to start most times, and sometimes wont start at all without a jump. I replaced the battery and it was fine for a week until it started back up again lol. Now i'm finding myself having to jumpstart it more frequently then before. 

\- Apple car play will no longer work, and charging my phone on the cord is hit or miss when its plugged into the car. Of course I bought new charging cords THREE times thinking the cords were the issue but to no avail, I had to chalk it up to it being another issue with the vehicle itself. (The phone is brand new, and charges fine in the house or in my fiancé's car so im certain its not a phone issue either) 

  
I cant think of anything else at this very moment but needless to say, the list of issues with this blazer is damn near endless. I am so tired of spending money for nothing, and having it looked at numerous times. Only for nobody being able to figure out what is actually causing all of this. I am paying on this vehicle for 4 more years and im so afraid that something big is going to happen and im going to be out of all of the money ive put into it as well as what I still owe on it. I'm terrified to be honest.

Use a multimeter to check for voltage drop between battery negative ground terminal and block and other grounds to see if there is an issue.

From their notes there are issues on the power wiring side with short to grounds and broken wires, etc. - and that could be what you're dealing with, or water intrusion. On other vehicles by different makes you can see issues with water damage on the underside of the fuse box board.

If grounds check out you might want to also have your alternator thoroughly tested as they can cause all of these types of failures when failing themselves. Failing batteries can damage alternators which in turn can damage new batteries. People will bounce back and forth between changing battery and then alternator over and over again, and never realize that if you change the alternator the battery needs to be verified as good, or it will fail and damage the new alternator as it goes out.

1m778um,Dead battery,"So someone hit my car (‘23 accord hybrid with around 20K miles) last month, and it was in the body shop for almost exactly a month. I picked it up Monday, did a few errands (short hops and then drove home probably around 6 miles), went to get something out of the trunk yesterday, and the battery is dead. I find it a little weird that it died after just a couple of years, that it worked Monday and then died after being driven. I realize that most of the driving I dis on Monday wouldn’t have done much to add charge to the battery… but also I would think all the battery has to do in this car is start up the hybrid battery, so I don’t know how much juice that draws.

So my question is — do I replace the battery, or just charge it, figuring it was depleted by sitting in the shop for over 4 weeks? And if I replace it, is this something Honda should do under warranty?

Update — called the body shop to ask if the battery had died while in the shop (I suspect it did, bc the trip odometer mileage was wiped, which also was the only setting that was lost after the battery died yesterday.) They told me to bring it back, tested the battery, which is apparently fine, and checked the connections. So far,so good!

1m7105m,When the A/C Doesn’t Work on a Prius Gen 3 – Three Real Reasons You Should Know (The Third One Might Surprise You),"
Toyota Prius Gen 3 came to me with a classic issue — air conditioning not working and a compressor-related fault code stored.

Most techs check only one or two things and call it a day. But I’ve seen this issue over a dozen times — and I can tell you right away there are three common causes. Two of them are obvious. One is not. And the third one is the reason so many compressors are replaced in vain.

Here’s what I’ve learned from the field.

1. Refrigerant pressure too high or too low

Simple, but real. Low refrigerant pressure? The A/C system won’t engage. Overfilled? Same result — compressor won’t kick in. Always check the pressures first using proper gauges before blaming anything else.

2. Compressor damaged after head gasket repair

This one’s common and nasty. The Gen 3 Prius is known for head gasket failures. When that happens, the engine is removed or the water pump and cylinder head are taken apart.

The A/C compressor isn’t usually touched — but its connector sits low and exposed. Mechanics disconnect it during engine work but often forget to seal it.

Coolant leaks out, runs down the engine, and finds its way into the open A/C compressor connector. What happens next? The fluid seeps into the control board inside the compressor. At first start — short circuit. The internal board fries, and the compressor dies silently. No external damage. Just dead.


The fix? If you’re doing engine work, seal the compressor connector with tape or rubber plug. Every time.

3. The secret fuse inside the inverter


Now this is the trick most people don’t know. The A/C system in the Prius is high-voltage. It doesn’t run off a belt — the compressor is electric, powered through the hybrid inverter system.

There’s a hidden fuse inside the inverter case itself — a small barrel-type fuse that protects the A/C compressor’s circuit.

When that fuse blows, the system sees an open circuit — and logs compressor failure. Everyone replaces the compressor, the relay, maybe even the hybrid battery. But the real issue is a small fuse you can’t see unless you open the inverter.

How to check it:
	•	Disconnect the orange hybrid battery safety plug.
	•	Remove the top bolts and the metal cover from the inverter.
	•	Locate the fuse barrel (usually cylindrical, plastic-topped, near the corner).
	•	You can’t check it visually. Only with a multimeter. It must show continuity.

If it’s open — it’s blown. You can replace it with a used one from a donor inverter or find one on eBay.

Put everything back together, and the compressor will come back to life. No codes. No guessing. Just fixed.

Important note: This is high-voltage work. If you don’t have training — don’t touch the inverter. It can kill. This is not a joke. I’m a professional with years of experience and insulated tools.

So, next time you see a Prius with a dead A/C compressor — don’t rush to replace it. First check pressures. Then ask about engine work. And finally — if all else fails — pop the inverter and test that hidden fuse.

It might save you $1,500 and a lot of frustration.

~102,500 miles. Replacement engine installed by another shop after auction purchase. Car ran fine — until stop-start triggered at a red light.

When the engine shut off (as designed), it wouldn’t restart. Just crank… and then full dash blackout. Cycling the key brought it back, but the issue repeated every time stop-start engaged.

🔍 No CEL. No DTCs. No freeze frame.
The previous shop had tried everything — ECM reflash, fuses, grounds, relays, crank sensor (OEM), even checked CAN lines. Still no fix.

Client brought it to me as a last resort.

I hooked up my diagnostic oscilloscope and checked the CKP signal directly.
Waveform looked clean — but pulses were too slow for the ECM to accept during stop-start. Sensor worked fine during manual cranking, but not at low-RPM automatic restart.

⚠️ Here’s the kicker:
The OEM crank sensor they used matched the VIN and came straight from Toyota. But it had the wrong internal specs — too low frequency for the stop-start logic. Not documented anywhere. No TSB. No flag in the parts catalog. Both part numbers are “compatible” — but they’re not equal in signal behavior.

I sourced a similar sensor from another Toyota engine (same mount/connector, different PN). Scoped it on the bench — cleaner waveform, tighter pulse train.

Installed → Cleared adaptations → Ran stop-start relearn → Problem solved.

🔥 Now the car restarts flawlessly at every stoplight.

⸻

Lesson:
Not all OEM parts are equal — especially with timing-critical systems like stop-start. VIN-matched ≠ functionally identical. And sometimes, only an oscilloscope tells the truth.",2,1753248491.0,2,autorepair,1753384568,2025-07-23 05:28:11,2025-07-24 19:16:08,"BugPuzzleheaded3015 (Score: 1): TL;DR

And it really depends on what type of smoke and what vehicle it is. (I'm currently working on an older Ford that is burning oil and coolant because the lower intake plenum is leaking into the cylinder head intake ports.) Not sure what invoice you are talking about. But... If I am understanding you correctly; they should take it back to the original technician and have them reevaluate the situation. Depending on how deep they need to dig they shouldn't charge you again but be prepared to pay for diagnostics, but do not approve any repairs unless they can point out and explain the problem in a way that you can understand. Go somewhere else if they can't. It may be cheaper to throw a used engine at it instead of continuing to ""figure out"" this one.

There is no sense in small claims court. The only thing that the technician will have to say is that the vehicle was presented to them with an issue, they found a related part that was defective. The customer approved the repair. They performed the repair within manufacturer specifications and the symptoms subsided. Then... After it left the property, a new issue arose unrelated to the initial repair. It's crappy and unfair, I know. But that's how the judge will see it.

Ultimately, see if the original technician can reevaluate. If not, take it somewhere else. If they can't fix the issue, find someone who will swap this engine out for a used one."

No signs of coolant/oil mixing internally yet but the outside of the block is pretty covered.

1m7j46x,I need an A/C doctor for diagnosis help,"2010 Honda Civic

TLDR: My compressor clutch seems to turn off randomly, and stay off for a random amount of time. This has been a multi-year journey trying to diagnose the root problem, so I am trying to gather a little more information. 

**Assuming there is no leak in the A/C system, and the compressor is brand new, what are all the things that could cause a compressor clutch to turn off, and stay off for a random amount of time (sometimes minutes, sometimes days) before coming back on?** 

**My current theory is that an old and clogged condenser is causing the freon pressure to go wonky which is causing the clutch to turn off, which then further messes up the freon pressure.** 

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**



**Background** every time I’ve had the A/C recharged or looked at in any way, the air blows a little colder and the A/C seems to last longer before the clutch shuts off, but the performance gradually gets worse, and the clutch stays off longer and longer. I would have sworn this means a leak, but after 3 trips to the mechanic, no leaks have been found. 

  
So now here is all the extra information of what I’ve tried, what I still plan to try, and what I suspect: 



* 6 years ago my A/C entirely stopped working. I brought it to a mechanic who replaced the compressor with one from a junked Civic and he called it a day. It worked but it was never as cold as it used to be. 



* 2 years after that, the A/C got warmer and warmer and eventually started to fully cut out for 30 minutes at a time. I noticed the compressor clutch wasn’t turning. 



* I brought it to a better mechanic who checked for leaks and said he couldn’t find any, topped off the charge. The A/C was nice and cold and not cutting out for about a month. Performance got worse, then cutting out started happening again, until it was virtually never working. 



* I tested the relays. I changed the cabin filter. I inspected the evaporator looking for pooling water. Mechanic performed a pressure check. 



* I started to suspect that because the first mechanic didn’t replace the receiver drier or condenser, some contaminant was putting stress on the system and forcing the clutch off somehow. I asked my mechanic if I should replace the compressor, condenser, and drier. He insisted on just the compressor even though I wanted to do the compressor, condenser, drier, and expansion valve.



* Bought a new OEM compressor, system evacuated, no metal shavings or contaminant found, new compressor put in. Bliss! Working A/C! Nice and cold! For 3 weeks. Now all the old problems are back, and as of today, the A/C cycled off with the compressor clutch not spinning, and it’s been that way for 2 days. I hear the RPS surge and the system engage, but the clutch doesn’t start spinning. **The last thing I will try is jumping the power to the compressor to make sure it’s functional. If it is, something higher up the chain must be sending it the signal to shut off and stay off - but why? And how does that relate to the A/C quality gradually degrading?** 



**Could it be…**



A faulty pressure switch? - it fits some of the symptoms, like the clutch not spinning sometimes. But it doesn’t explain the gradual decline in QUALITY of the A/C temp, which seems linked to how often the Clutch stops. 

Clogged expansion valve?

Under or overcharged? Unlikely, it’s been charged and recharged so many times how would different mechanics all mess it up the same way?

Engine temp sensor too high, ECU cutout for overheat protection?

Faulty wiring / bad a-c clutch coil?  


I’m going to try replacing the pressure switches myself and see if that solves the problem. Then I’m going to try replacing the temp sensors (though that seems more complicated and expensive). If none of those work, I feel like my only option is to go back to my mechanic and insist on a FULL replacement of the compressor, valve, condenser, drier. I’m tempted to seek out an A/C specialist to triple check for leaks.

Today (day 6, 200 miles later) this is what the brakes are like:
- ""hissing"" noise when I press the pedal louder than it was before
- have to press the pedal about twice as far or more for the same stopping power
- when the engine is off and I press the pedal repeatedly it hardens (which I would expect)
- when the engine is ON and I press the pedal repeatedly it hardens, if I then keep my foot on the pedal it slowly depresses.

I took it back to the garage today and they test drove it and put in on a rolling brake test. They said the front brakes were off the scales and the back were at 400 (whatever that means).

They said the softer response will be due to them being brembo pads, they are chamfered and will slowly get stronger, that they are coated for anti corrosion and that will wear off, and that the fact they were so responsive before will be because the chamfering had worn flat.

They insisted there wasn't a master cylinder issue or air in the lines. They said they didn't even open the lines up (should they have replaced the brake fluid for a full brake change?)

Plumpshady (Score: 3): I'm sorry but I work at Valvoline and this won't be their fault nor will they pay. If they review your invoice and a leak was already noted you are 100% shit out of luck, you're already 99% shit out of luck because you had your oil changed over a month ago. 

For example, we just had a lady come in in a 2022 Tiguan on Sunday. She made a claim the next day that we didn't add oil to her engine, and we are ""responsible"" for the new cost. This lady drive to CALIFORNIA. We told her if we didn't add oil she wouldn't have made it to California. District manager reviewed the cameras, and this lady is shit out of luck. It wasn't Valvolines fault. We did absolutely everything we were supposed to do, and that engine isn't on us it's on her because a severe leak was noted and we followed our super pro process to a tee. 

Your car I believe has a carpeted skidplate on the bottom, which could have caught leaking oil which is why you didn't see it. But for a month to go by before an issue? It's unlikely to be the oil change. I have been unfortunate enough to be underneath a customers car, taking the oil filter off, when they decided to fire it up. If that Valvoline didn't put the filter on right, you would have known driving home not In a month. When I tell you that oil will fly out of your engine where the filter goes, it FLYS. You would've lost enough oil to damage your engine within a few hours of driving not a month. 


I'm not saying this to defend Valvoline I'm saying all this because I know how we operate and I know how vehicles operate. You should call them and make a claim directly. They'll immediately start reviewing footage and your invoice, but if they noted any sort of engine oil leak during that visit, then Valvoline is not responsible. It was already leaking, and again a month down the line? I really doubt any chance this company will pay for your engine. We are meticulous at least at my store about preventing claims by following Valvolines super pro process. Now there is always the chance they'll find something on the DVR that will lead to you getting your engine replaced, but I doubt it.

I will also add the chance of the oil filter not being tightened enough is rare. They BARELY need to be tightened. At my store we always use a tool and make sure it's definitely tight, but on my personal vehicles I do the typical recommendation of 8-9ft lbs. Literally hand tight. They rarely come loose and don't need to be cranked down to begin with. I could gently spin on your oil filter till it touches the base plate, and then give it a half turn and it wouldn't go anywhere. 


My advice is again just make a claim directly with Valvoline and they'll review the footage."

It was near the water intake assembly but I replaced that a year. I did see some bubbles on it almost like the engine had a lot of pressure in it? I let the car cool off and then drove it home (this is probably my biggest mistake, the drive wasn't far ~3 miles but it did overheat again, I pulled over let it cool off, and then finished the drive). I parked it and hadn't drive it since.

Today when I went to inspect it more, I ran a code reader and got the code P00B7. I started the car and immediately ~30 seconds after starting it starts emmiting this smoke. It smells like burnt rubber almost. I tested the water pump and it's still circulating fluid. I checked the dip stick, and the oil cap and there's none of that foamy gunk like it's mixing, just regular oil. I haven't noticed any abnormal oil drainage. When I start the car it starts kind of high rpms but then settles and that's when the smoke starts.

I was thinking maybe a blown head gasket, manifold, or something with the exhaust?

Symptoms: trouble idling or going lower than 2mph in drive and In reverse. No trouble while in drive or neutral. Air conditioning seems to make it worse. The other driver of the car says they’ve noticed the dash lights dim here and there as well, though I haven’t. By trouble I mean shaking and now a flapping sound. The car does still drive and seems to have very little issue once it’s going.

Time frame: last two months (like I said money is tight so we’ve just been monitoring very closely). Started as a bit of a rumbling, has now progressed to the shaking and the sound.

Process: electronic diagnostics produced exactly zero codes. after research we deduced it was a timing belt issue and our neighbor was happy to replace it for us, but he got in and said the timing belt was fine, but the AC belt was fraying. We got the part (though he said despite the fraying the one in the car was still better quality than what we bought) and after going in again HE said it was the alternator that was the problem (with not much more info than that…

History: coolant leak caused the need for a whole new engine three months after purchase. At the time we just didn’t think to pay attention to the engine size or if it had a name, it was an emergency and the problem got solved. This engine has things in non-typical places and we’ve only found one picture on the internet, mind you one picture, engine replacement done by ford. Battery replaced just under 3 months ago. Our area is hot, humid and dusty/pollen rich.

Goal: At this point, at the very least, we just need to figure out what the true problem is. From there when can decide who and when and how to get it repaired.

If anyone on here can read this post and say “this is clearly the problem” that would be gold. Otherwise I’m thinking our best bet is to find anywhere that will do a *free* in depth inspection to hands-on diagnose instead of running a computer check.

1m70qun,Unusual Traction issue when turning left at high speed,"Hello People! I’m hoping someone more knowledgeable than I can help me diagnose an issue I’ve been noticing on a car I recently got (2016 Scion FR-S FA20 2.0L Boxer) before I take it to a shop.

The problem: At high speeds (above 45 mph) when I turn left with more steering input than just changing lanes (think like taking a ramp from freeway to freeway) my traction control kicks in but it does not happen when I turn right. This happens agnostic of power application.

What I’ve tried:

Tire wear? Nope - recently replaced rear tires and front tires have plenty of tread

Tire pressure? Nope - made sure that tire pressure was good across all tires.Is it the wheel speed sensor making TC and VSC turn on? I tried the same maneuver with TC and VSC off and I noticed the car go into an oversteer and then correct itself but it was kinda concerning. Did not happen when I turned right. I concluded that it wasn’t the wheel speed sensors causing this and the vehicle is actually losing grip and TC is trying to help.

Alignment? See alignment sheet, potentially but unlikely? I got an alignment check and everything looked fine. There’s a slight difference in the rear camber between left and right but it’s very minor. My caster is out in the front but there’s no caster adjustment on the vehicle. This could be due to some of the mods but I am unsure. Chat GPT swears it’s the camber difference but I’m interested in opinions.

Aside from the caster being out I don’t see anything wrong from an alignment check alone but maybe there’s something bigger wrong with the geometry? Any ideas? See full list of mods below.

I have a 2016 Toyota Corolla (CVT) and recently replaced the transmission pan, gasket, and filter due to fluid seeping from the back edge of the pan.

Here’s what’s been done so far: •	First mechanic changed the gasket and filter, but it still leaked. •	He then tried adding RTV sealant — still leaked. •	I went back and had them install a brand-new transmission pan with a new gasket. •	There are no drips or puddles under the car even after overnight parking.

But when I touch the back side of the transmission after a long drive and press a tissue or napkin to it, I still pick up a bit of reddish fluid. It’s like it’s just barely weeping or sweating through somewhere.

They found and repaired a leak, but now I’m noticing that the vents facing the passenger side are blowing frigid air, while the vents facing the driver’s side are blowing just sort of cool air. 

History of ac with the car, in case it’s relevant:
-the ac started blowing hot back in 2022.

-I put some Freon in it myself, but found that only some of the vents blew cold air and the rest still blew hot air.

-I took it to the dealership, told them what was happening and they said they couldn’t find a leak but added more Freon and the vents all blew cold air again

-beginning of this summer, it started blowing hot air again. I took it to a well-recommended local mechanic this time. They replaced the evaporator expansion valve and recharged the ac

-the ac was blowing cold, but not frigid, but I figured it’s a 10 year old car, maybe this is the best I get, until I reached across my passenger seat for something and realized that those vents ARE blowing absolutely frigid air. 

My question is this: could this issue be something that was missed or messed up at the most recent mechanic visit, or would this more likely be an entirely separate issue that I’ll have to fully pay for a whole new appointment for?

1m7jtnp,Ongoing issue w/car not starting,"2008 Honda CRV \~204500 miles, 4-cylinder, automatic

TL;DR ongoing ""car won't start"" issues for the past few years, ""just needs a new battery"" every time. VERY detailed explanation to follow.

Bit of a long story, an ongoing saga and I am at my wits' end. It's hard to decide where to start because the symptoms of what I believe is the underlying cause have been ongoing for several years, and no dealership/service center has really listened to me when I tell them that I really think there is something more to the problem than just replacing the battery/alternator/starter will fix. I was living in CA a couple years ago and getting ready to move to CO, and my car was having slow start issues but not severely slow, and it never flat-out refused to start. Prior to that, the battery (both Honda batteries, it should be noted) had died within the ""replace at no cost"" timeframe twice within a couple of years. Before I left for CO I was working for a dealership and I asked them to basically do a thorough inspection and fix anything that needed to be done before leaving. They diagnosed the starting system and said the alternator needed replacing, so we did that. That was June 2023, and it was fine all the way until November 2024, now in CO.

I went out to leave for work one morning and it was completely dead. As in, I could not even remote-unlock it and there was not a single light on in the vehicle, as if the battery was completely disconnected. I sat there stunned for a moment, deciding what to do next, then when I put the key in it was suddenly alive again and started right up as if nothing had happened. The radio required the security code, which only happens when the battery has been completely disconnected from the car, such as during replacement. Even a ""dead"" battery has never been \*that\* dead in my car before. It had not been showing any signs at all of anything being off up to that point; no slow-starting or anything. It did this multiple times over the course of a week; meanwhile I had made an appointment to get it in to be looked at. They determined that it just needed a new battery which, at this point, it actually did, the battery was almost 5 years old. It was perfectly fine again until June 2nd of this year, we are now in FL since February. I went out to my car after work and it was once again completely dead as if the battery had been disconnected completely. I work for a used car dealership here, and so they hooked it up to a jumpstarter and I took it to a Valvoline Instant Oil Change. (I have reasons for not getting work done at work.) They tested it, determined the battery was bad despite being only a few months old, put in a new one with a 3-year zero cost warranty, and on my way I went. Zero issues until today.

Went out to leave for work, completely dead as if battery was completely disconnected, waited, eventually got it to start up and took it to Valvoline. They said it was fine but maybe alternator was not working all the time, told me to call them next time and they will come to me and fix it for free. I cannot afford to keep calling in to work every time this happens, so I took it to Honda right away from there.

Took it to Honda, asked them to be very thorough in diagnosing it, told them the whole saga, told them I'm pretty sure it's got to be cables/wires/something NOT battery/starter/alternator given this is the 4th battery in 5 years and there's always corrosion even though they spray the anti-corrosion stuff every time and it's behaving as if there's a short somewhere. They say they ran all kinds of tests, including testing for parasitic drain, etc. and have come to the conclusion it ""just needs a Honda battery."" I am losing my shit internally at this point but after some calm, impressively professional back and forth, I decide to just let them replace the battery (AGAIN) and so now when (not if, WHEN) this happens again they will have to dig deeper and I will insist it not cost me much, if anything, because I was very adamant it was not the damn battery, but they would not do anything until putting in a @#)(&amp;ing Honda battery. Fine.

So my question is, what the hell could actually be going on? If it's not the battery/starter/alternator and there are no ""parasites"", what else could it be? And how can I get someone to take me seriously and look at the damn cables and wires and get to the underlying problem? What can I do? This car is still running so well for its age besides this ongoing issue so I would very much like to get this taken care of once and for all.

What I would do is turn the ignition on but do not start, then wiggle wires associated with main power.  See if there is a loose ground or main power connection that causes the power to flick off.  My guess is you have corroded or loose ground points.

yesrod85 (Score: 5): You should never have to top off brake fluid as it's a closed system. 

You either have a leak which is highly unlikely as you would have a shit feeling brake peddle. Or more likely you are due for a brake job/replacement brake pads/shoes. 

As the friction material wears off your pads and shoes the brake caliper (wheel cylinder on drums) has to extend further out to compress the pads. This takes fluid to push it out resulting in a lower reservoir level. 

If you do top the reservoir off, nothing bad happens. When you do get your brake pads/shoes replaced you will then have too much fluid (if they just push the calipers in without bleeding/opening) resulting in spillage. 

It's not bad to top it off, but your main concern should be that you're more than likely low on friction material and are due for brakes.

Edit: Upon a closer look at your photo, you're probably fine. You have a ways to go until you hit the low level line/mark. Never a bad idea to have a tech look at it if you're concerned though."

Started getting loud again, and noticed its rusting through right where the exhaust pipe joins the flange that connects to the muffler.  The rust holes are so close to the corner where it meets the flange that it doesn’t look like it can be fixed without a part that includes both a short length of pipe and a new flange.

The rest of the pipe is mostly fine, the catalytic converter looks clean, the muffler looks good.  The only other bits that look at risk of failure are the hangers, which are inexplicably welded to the exhaust instead of being modular/replaceable.

Mechanic is saying the whole exhaust needs to be replaced.   This seems so wasteful.   Is there really no practical way to patch or reinforce or replace the flange and the small section of rusted exhaust pipe?

Does no one offer a press-fit product that allows you to cut off the old flange upstream from the rust and re-attach the exhaust pipe and muffler?

Either way, I’m going to be doing this repair/replacement myself.   If I go with a new exhaust pipe, what aftermarket brands are less likely to rust out as quickly.

Please spare me the strife of having to read any Subaru slander. Simply looking for feed back, thanks :) 
TL;DR at bottom. 

Hey! I’ve noticed a trend with my foz. The morning after get back from a road trip- it overheats! The first time this happened, I drove 1.5 hours one way the first day, then drove 1.5 hours back the next. The morning after I got back, I got ready for work, let the car heat up as normal, but didn’t make it a mile down the road before I noticed the temp gauge rapidly rising. Immediately, I pulled over, turned the car off, let it cool for a min before checking fluids. I noticed the coolant was low so I grabbed some fluids and topped her off and got back home with no issue. I took the extra family vehicle to work. When I got home, I made sure to bleed the system properly. No more issues until yesterday (2 weeks later), when I decided to make the same trip. 1.5 hours one day, 1.5 hours the next. This time, I was able to make it to work but when I went to leave (after letting the car reach operating temp) I, once again, barely got a mile down the road before the temp gauge started rising again. I popped the hood, and coolant was boiling out of the coolant expansion / overflow tank beside the radiator. I took off the coolant reservoir cap with ease (no pressure), and it was a little low but nothing crazy, and then I took off the radiator cap, again no pressure release or spewed coolant, but it was empty. Added some coolant to the radiator and then was able to get her home with no issue, engine temp remained normal. 

SOME THINGS TO NOTE:
-Outside temperature has been consistently in the 80s, AC was on both times car overheated. I haven’t run the heater in awhile. 
-Coolant / oil is not milky. No blow by or white smoke from the exhaust. 
-Head gaskets were replaced in the last 40k miles 
-Fans work 
-Only seems to happen when I drive 1.5 he one day and 1.5 hr the next. I can make a 3 hr round trip in a day and be fine. 

TL;DR Car overheats day after long drive, tends to fix itself. Expansion tank FULL, reservoire has coolant, radiator doesn’t have coolant. No pressure / coolant spew when taking of either cap. I let car cool down, top off the coolant in radiator, burp it, and continue home with no overheating issue where I then properly burp it and remove excess coolant from the overflow tank. Thinking it could be faulty thermostat, or air getting pulled into the system somehow. Air could be getting in the system during long drives and then settling over night to form a big bubble.

1m7dsil,Brake pedal sometimes sinks under light pressure — mechanic says brakes are fine. Should I be concerned?,"Hey everyone, I’ve been noticing something odd with my 2007 Nissan Maxima’s brake pedal. Sometimes, when I brake slowly or gently, the pedal sometimes sinks farther down than usual before it firms up. But if I press harder or brake normally, it feels fine and doesn’t sink. Other times I will brake slowly to try and replicate it and it still doesn't sink. It's possible I'm overthinking, but I don't remember this happening before.

I took it to a mechanic who inspected the system and mentioned that the rear calipers aren’t applying pressure as well as they should, but he also said that wouldn’t cause the sinking pedal issue I’m describing. He said to not worry about those and just change it next time I get a brake job done.

He bled the brakes and got some air out, but overall said the brakes feel great and didn’t find any leaks. The problem is, it’s really hard to replicate the sinking pedal consistently, so even the mechanic couldn’t reproduce it on demand.

I’ve done some tests myself (holding the pedal, pumping it, checking for sinking with engine off, etc.) and everything seems okay except for this occasional pedal sink during very light braking.

Has anyone experienced something similar? Is this normal behavior in ABS-equipped or vacuum-boosted cars? Or should I push harder to have the master cylinder or something else checked?

1m7d54e,"Sleeping In My Car The Past Month, Lots of Idle Time to Keep the AC Running During Multiple Heatwaves and Car Is Starting To Overheat When Idle Only. Fine When Driving","Hello everyone. I posted about a month ago about living in my 2009 Toyota Avalon during that crazy heatwave in the Midwest after some issues with my landlord where I gave a notice that I was moving out and they kicked me out two months early. I got a ton of replies a lot of good advice because I was worried about any damage to the car from having to idle it for super long hours because we were just hitting that heat dome at the time and I needed the AC on. I put a lot of idle time on my car just to keep the air on during those first few weeks so I stay cool and not have a heat stroke. I followed the advice on doing oil changes every couple weeks by converting my idle time to mileage and I changed my schedule a bit to reduce the amount of time I needed to be in the car in general. Now it’s been getting cool enough at night I’ve been able to turn it off and don’t need the air at all once the sun goes down.

I am moving into a new apartment the second weekend in August and I thought I had made it through the worst of it. But two days ago, I was having a rough day. I woke up and realized I left the door open slightly so the door lights has been on all night and the battery died. I got a jump, which successfully started the car back up and then I started to leave the parking lot and realized my tire was also really low on air. I was close to the used tire shop so I just drove there to have them check it and while I was waiting for them to finish with someone else since it was midday and super hot I was just sitting in my car with the air conditioning on and I noticed the air conditioner started blowing warm air. It was strange because I’ve never had a single problem with it before then. Even those days running the car pretty much all night when the temps didn’t drop. I was fiddling around with it. I tried turning the AC on and off. I checked the temperature to make sure it was actually at the lowest  and after about five minutes, I actually noticed the car was starting to overheat. It hadn’t raised a lot at this point, but it was a little over the halfway point on the temperature gauge you know when usually it stays at that set spot underneath the half way point.  And it was still slightly going up at a slow but consistent speed so I turned off the car while they patched the tire.

When I left after the car had been off for like 10 minutes, the temperature went back down and actually my air conditioning was blowing cold again so I was like that’s strange. I need to figure out what’s going on cause if it happens once it’s probably gonna happen. But I was on the highway for the next hour and I didn’t notice any issues until I went to McDonald’s to eat and while stuck in a long drive-through line, it started overheating again, and the air conditioner started blowing warm. After testing it the next day and a half, it basically blows, warm and overheats whenever it idles for too long or stuck in like stop and go traffic for more than like five minutes. As long as I’m driving 15-20 miles an hour or more it’s good and the air will even stay cool at stoplights and such as long as I don’t get stuck for a long time. Once the air starts blowing warm though the car usually starts overheating about five minutes later.I’m not sure how the fans are supposed to be behaving but from what I gathered online, they should be on when the air conditioning is on full. So I pulled into a parking spot and popped hood when the car was starting to blow warm and I noticed that neither of the fans in front of the radiator and air conditioning condenser were on. The driver side fan I was able to spin by hand and eventually it start going on its own but the passenger side fan I couldn’t do the same with. Lastly, the coolant is at the full/cold line and there doesn’t appear to be any leaks.

So am I right and assuming that it’s these fans that’s causing the problem and the reason it works at any level of speed is just because I get natural airflow? And is there like a fan motor that’s causing the problem or is it the entire fan assembly that would have to be replaced or do you think it’s something entirely different? I included the stuff about having to get the car jumped because I don’t know if maybe we shorted something out or did something stupid but that might just be extraneous information that you don’t need but the problem did start occurring immediately after getting that jump and I know the fans are electrical so I just included that. I’m sure the fact that I’ve just been running the car for so many hours a day to keep the air on could’ve caused an issue with the fan on its own since the car has 131,000 miles on it. Anyways sorry for the long ass post.

TLDR; after surviving the worst part of the heat wave sleeping in my car and having to idle the car and keep the air conditioning on all night for super long hours, my car died the other day and had to be jumped because I left the door open overnight on accident and after the jump (which may be completely unrelated and coincidental), a little while later my air-conditioning started blowing warm air and my car started slowly overheating but only when the car is idling or stuck in stop and go traffic for more than five minutes or so.

1m7bara,2020 chevy blazer with SO MANY PROBLEMS!!!!!,"I originally leased my 2020 blazer brand new and had no issues at all during my 3 year leasing term. I ended up buying out my lease after 3 years and OF COURSE thats when all the trouble started...

Where on earth do I even start!? First it started saying ESC and ""Steering assist reduced. Drive with care."" When that started, the steering became really stiff and damn near every light on the dashboard lit up (engine, battery, etc). At the same time, my AC started not blowing out cold air, and the fan on the car was really loud. I had it checked out and was told that I had a crack in the container that holds the coolant in the car, and that my blazer basically went into ""panic mode"" due to being low on coolant. Had the coolant container replaced, and all was well for a little while.

Fast forward to about a month later, all the same issues started again, but this time with MORE problems to add to the list....

Now to save myself from not making this post miles and miles long, I'm not going to keep going into a ton of detail and explaining everything in order I'll just list everything I've experienced thus far with my blazer. Basically, it started glitching out everywhere....

\- The parking break light now randomly goes on for no reason at all.

\- The radio screen will black out sometimes.

\- Sometimes the AC/Heat will turn on, but not light up or let me control it or turn it off.

\- The car will stall out at red lights or any stops and quickly restart (different than the auto stop/start feature).

\- The keyfob will not always recognize. Thought the battery was dead/low in the keyfob, so I replaced it and that did nothing. It will makes me put the keyfob into the cupholder (where the transmitter pocket is) in order to recognize it and start the engine up.

\- Engine hesitates to start most times, and sometimes wont start at all without a jump. I replaced the battery and it was fine for a week until it started back up again lol. Now i'm finding myself having to jumpstart it more frequently then before.

\- Apple car play will no longer work, and charging my phone on the cord is hit or miss when its plugged into the car. Of course I bought new charging cords THREE times thinking the cords were the issue but to no avail, I had to chalk it up to it being another issue with the vehicle itself. (The phone is brand new, and charges fine in the house or in my fiancé's car so im certain its not a phone issue either)

I cant think of anything else at this very moment but needless to say, the list of issues with this blazer is damn near endless. I am so tired of spending money for nothing, and having it looked at numerous times. Only for nobody being able to figure out what is actually causing all of this. I am paying on this vehicle for 4 more years and im so afraid that something big is going to happen and im going to be out of all of the money ive put into it as well as what I still owe on it. I'm terrified to be honest.

1m6zr9f,1997 Vw T4 Transporter: Dash/power cut out on startup.,"Hi, I have a 1997 VW t4 Transporter 2.5L (Manual) Petrol.

When I start the vehicle cold the power power cuts out like in the video and goes back to normal.

After this the fuel, speedometer and rev gauge is normally thowrn out of whack.

But if I go out and reset the power terminals (disconnect and reconnect the battery it goes back to normal) and after I've done (so far) it continues you normally on/off till the next day when I go to start it up again and have same issue.

I've looked everywhere online to find this problem and have come up with nothing. The clossest I've gotten is possibly a loose ground terminal that has caused a similar issue in a different vehicle.

I've also replaced the battery thinking it would fix this problem but it did not. So charging and discharging is not an issue.

Considering all the information that is out there for the 1997 VW T4 Transporter, I thought I would post this in the hopes of finding a solution and possibly leaving one behind in case anyone else has the same issue.

1m6yfve,Weird discoloration near back of caliper and under tie rod — brakes still screeching,"I drive a 2007 Camry LE with DOT 3 brake fluid. I noticed some weird discoloration around the back of my caliper area and also under what looks like the tie rod. The brake fluid reservoir is full — right at MAX. I recently got my brakes changed, but the screeching I’ve been hearing from both the front and rear brakes didn’t go away. The screeching only stops briefly when I first start driving - but returns progressively throughout driving or after getting off the freeway (maybe from high-speed braking?).

I went back and asked the shop to spray more brake cleaner to try and fix the screeching — maybe that’s what I’m seeing around the area? But that barely worked and the noise came back pretty quick. ( I got my brakes changed early to mid June, it’s been screeching ever since.)

Right now, my brakes feel spongy and only build pressure when I pump the brake pedal while the car is off. But when I try pumping the brakes while the car is on, they don’t really build any pressure.

What’s weird is that the tie rod-looking thing is wet-looking at the bottom, but dry on top. I’m 100% sure they didn’t spray brake cleaner down there. I also noticed a small clear puddle under the car — felt like water when I touched it — could that be the same stuff that’s on the tie rod or maybe condensation from AC? The car wash I went through recently also cleaned the underbody, so I’m not sure if it’s related. But I think it’s very possible….

Just wondering if this is something I should be worried about. Any help is appreciated. 

I want to take it to drive it to the mechanic tomorrow after I get back home from work but if it’s a brake fluid leak I don’t think it’s a safe decision to drive it back home from work or even to the mechanic. That’s why I want to know if it’s a brake fluid leak.

1m7kxja,2019 Peugeot 308 40k miles - new engine needed? Help!,"Hi there, hoping for some advice as I’m fairly clueless with cars; my partner &amp; I bought a second hand Peugeot 208 with 20k miles on the clock back in 2021. We’ve had no problems whatsoever for the last 4 years, and always done an annual full service etc. but suddenly last weekend an amber engine service light popped up with a message saying to take it to a garage..

We called the AA out and they diagnosed it as a misfiring cylinder, suspecting an ignition coil fault and suggested we take it to our local garage for a full diagnosis. We took it to our usual MOT &amp; service guy; he re-diagnosed it and replaced the ignition coil and some spark plugs but it still was misfiring. He then advised we take it to the nearest Peugeot garage (Stellantis &amp; You).

They then also did a diagnosis; agreed that it’s a cylinder misfire but believe that the piston valves have failed within the engine. They then said there’s a possibility of a bent or broken valve inside the engine, which has caused an oil leakage onto the spark plugs which has given the misfire.

The kicker is that they’re saying the only way to fix it is to replace the whole engine (which they want £7k to do); or sell the car and buy a new one.

We’re at a bit of a loss as to what to do; as we’re still paying off the loan for this car &amp; it just seems so crazy to need a whole new engine on a 6 year old car; but also we don’t know anything about cars and unsure if this is something that can typically happen.

I’d definitely get a second opinion before committing to anything.

If it is a valve issue, there’s a chance it could be repaired without needing a whole new engine. It is possible to rebuild or repair the top end of the engine for a lot less than what the dealership quoted. Dealers often go straight for the most expensive fix — in this case, full replacement — because it’s easier for them and under warranty guidelines.

You might also want to contact Peugeot/Stellantis directly and see if they’ll offer any goodwill support. It’s a long shot, but if you’ve got full service history and relatively low miles, they sometimes help out with repair costs — even out of warranty.

And worst case, if a replacement is the only way, you don’t necessarily have to go through the dealer. A used or reconditioned engine from a breaker’s yard, installed by an independent garage, could cost way less. 

Maybe also also talk to your lender. You don’t want to be stuck paying for a car you can’t use. Some lenders will let you roll over what’s left into another car loan, but only look at that if fixing it turns out to be totally uneconomical.

1m7iqgp,Bought a car. Now want to return,"So this is a long story and I apologise to anyone who has to read this haha.

On the 5th of July I bought a red mustang off a private seller for 25k

Drove fine for around a week and a half until I noticed the trans temp unusually high. At one point the temp was so high it put me into limp mode. I immediately thought to myself hang on, if the car feels like it is in limp mode why on earth didn’t the engine light come on. Overthinking the situation as I always do led me to take the car for an immediate mechanical inspection.
Obd reader in dashboard off.
Boom! Sticky tape over the engine light and airbag light.
An abundance of fault codes in regards to the airbag, safety systems and ambient temperature sensor.

Immediately got on the phone with the seller and as expected he denied all knowledge and then tried to say it was my fault for driving the car hard which he could see from the tracker HE STILL HAD ACCSESS TO installed in my car( ignore this legality for now I am building a case for this aswell)

I then realised luckily in the pre car sale messaging I found a video he sent me showing the engine light and airbag light not showing up as it should upon start up. With this I went back to him attaching the full mechanic report stating clear tampering with safety features my video proof the car was in this condition at the time of sale and a request for immediate halt of all illegal tracking of my car. Once again requested a refund but was ignored. 

Eventually he responded saying even if u take me to court u won’t get the money as I am insolvent and u won’t be able to make me pay.

Before u all start, yes! I know I should have had the car pre purchase inspected by a mechanic

But we live and we learn this is the situation I am currently in

Pretty confident I will win in court as I have proof of illegal tampering constituting an illegal and fraudulent sale of an unroadworthy motor car. 

Not sure on my next steps tho. Could go down the route of fixing the car myself however I assume the cars damage is extensive as why would he go through the effort of covering the engine light up.

I've got a VW ID.3 on PCP which I bought new in 2023. It's ideal for my needs, and I got top spec (panoramic roof, heat pump and James Bond tow bar fitted for a bike rack) so I'm really happy with it. I've noticed that the depreciation has been humongous in these first 2 years, much more than any ICE I've ever had and at the moment its value is about £2k less than the GFMV. So by the time my agreement comes to end in 2027, who knows what it's worth (probably about £5k less than GFMV based on equivalent 2021 plate now), but at the moment that's Volkswagens problem.  

I am contemplating keeping it though (particularly because I've had this since new, first ever brand new car) and getting off the PCP roundabout and just running it until it breaks.

The current settlement figure is pretty high, but I wondered whether I could negotiate with VWFS about meeting in the middle somewhere since they're onto a loss if I hand it back at the 50% point (probably sometime next year) or at the end of the agreement.

1m7fvd4,Do I have the wrong battery for my 70 plate Corsa? Stop/start function only works intermittently.,"Hi,

I'm after some opinions on the type of battery I need for my vauxhall Corsa please. The stop/start function hasn't worked properly for a couple of years now (I've had it three years, it's a 70 plate but bought new, no previous owner).   I have heard  conflicting opinions on the battery needed and decided to get mine tested at Halfords today to see if the battery had depleted.  They tested and told me it was at 92% so ""was fine"". I asked them why then the stop start hardly ever works. The mechanic there said that I had a ""normal"" battery fitted and this would never support the stop start function. 

Does this mean that the car was fitted with the wrong battery? Do I need a specific, I think it's and AGM or EFB, type battery for this stop start function to work? The mechanic at Halfords seemed to think so.  Other people have told me that this function would only work if I've ""charged"" it by doing long journeys. This doesn't seem practical for an every day use of a car.   Ive raised it with vauxhall before but they've never really looked into it.  

I've also got problems with the keyless engine start (have to hold the key against the dash board to start the engine) and sometimes the car doesn't unlock using the key fob. I've changed the batteries in the fobs which worked for about 2 days.   

Do I have a leg to stand on to fight my case with vauxhall for them to change the battery?

1m7cuhc,Have I been ripped off?,"Going to try and keep this short.

I know VERY little about cars, so I am hoping some of you can help me.

In January me and my wife bought a 2020 Honda Jazz hybrid from my local Honda dealership. It was not a planned purchase, as someone very kindly crashed into my much older Yaris that rendered it a write off. We weren't planning on spending so much money on a new car, but decided it was worth it for the longevity and peace of mind that a newer vehicle would give, with a lot more modern safety features to make driving more pleasant. 

We were told the car had been fully serviced prior to buying it - you'd think so for £15,000.

In May, I noticed the AC wasn't blowing as cold as it used to with the temperatures creeping up. Soon after, it was basically blowing whatever the ambient temperature was outside. The car was due for a recall for some brake issue anyway, so when booking it in, I also asked the AC to be checked. I explained how the car was purchased in Jan and not 6 months later, was blowing warm air. Both representatives I spoke to from the service section of Honda let me to believe this was a fault/damage as it didn't sound right for it to have run out so quickly, even though we do use the AC a lot. I asked them to confirm that the AC was working and in good shape (aka, GASSED) when I bought the car and they said yes. 

Because I was given a year's warranty when I bought the car and wasn't prepared to risk a potential bill of hundreds of pounds at another garage and also risk voiding the warranty, I decided to go with Honda for trying to repair this. Immediately, I was put in a queue and given an appointment 6 weeks in the future, putting me without of the AC for the entire start of the hot British summer. To try and give myself a chance, I asked Honda if I was allowed to just have the car re-gassed (not fixed) at a local garage for cheaper, just to get my by until they could fix it. They said it was fine, so I made some enquiries. Elite was willing to gas the car that day for £30, as opposed to the £166 Honda wanted to charge me (even though the car was under warranty). As soon as I told them what was happening with the AC, however, and that the engineer at Honda suspected it was the condenser that was broken, I was told they can't gas it, as it will just evaporate immediately. Feeling disappointed, I decided wait for Honda to see the car and got by as best I could with ice packs and windows down wherever possible. I thought that even though it's a long wait, at least we won't have to pay to get it fixed, as the damage to the AC will be covered under the warranty. After all, it's not like there would be NO damage and I'd end up paying an Apple Tax for a regas and a 6 week wait right?

Yesterday I picked up my car and was greeted with a bill for £166 for the regassing, which apparently found no damage. I asked how that could possibly be true, when we saw the time it took for the AC to go from functional, to blowing warm air. I asked if it was possible for a car to go from fully gassed to empty in 5 months, and the guy said yes. Everything I've ever read about AC gas tells me that's total rubbish, as cars are usually gassed every two years. No one in my family or friends has ever had AC gas run out in a handful of months. 

I told them that I felt as though I was led to believe the AC was damaged by more than one engineer, and therefore I couldn't gas it elsewhere quicker and cheaper. They basically were not interested in listening to my actual complaint and just kept repeating themselves that the car was fully serviced when I bought it and that there is no damage, but at this point I am worried they're just flat out lying to me that the gas was full when I bought the car. My theory is that the AC gas was almost empty, as the car had only one owner before me and she probably used up most of it in the short time she had the car. 

I know £166 sounds like a petty amount to argue over, but I went out of my way multiple times to say that I didn't want to pay that price for something that cost £30 down the road, and if there was any way the car could have no damage and just need a regas. Even if they sold me a car with no AC, which is still shitty for how much we paid for it, it would have been fine if I could fix the problem cheaply. I've already had to spend a huge chunk of my savings on this car when I didn't want to, was happy to have it under warranty so I at least wouldn't need to worry about money as much for the first year, only to have a bill of over a hundred pounds less than 6 months after buying it that was completely unnecessary. After making me wait six weeks for an appointment to get it fixed. 

My question is, does anyone know if what I've been told is correct and a car can run out of AC gas in 5 months, or am I just being lied to? I want to try and get a refund or at least file a complaint, but I don't have enough information to stand my ground. 

Also in general, even if £166 doesn't sound like a lot to you, that's totally fair, but it's a lot to me, so please be nice about it in the comments. I'm just asking for advice on whether there's any point in filing a complaint and trying to get a refund.

Someone will be along in a min stating that it isn't true as their fridge or home AC is over x years old & still working. They don't take into account that cars move, go over rough surfaces, jostle about etc - all things that other home AC systems don't do...

Anyway, topping up the refrigerant in your AC is something that you don't need to do at a garage. Just get the kit from Halfords (or any other motor factors) and do it yourself - much cheaper that way and literally takes 10 mins.

Unhappy-Tie7008 (Score: 2): Oh, and also £166 is not a lot.

Your car uses a new refrigerant type, so prices usually start from around £120 for a refill. £30 is not a realistic price.

Idonotlikepigeons (Score: 1): I would file a complaint anyway, but to answer your question, VERY unlikely unless it has a leak somewhere.  AC gassing wouldnt be included in a service performed before you bought it.  Most manufacturers recommend re-gassing every 2 years, so its possible its not been done in the cars lifetime and you just got dealt an unlucky card with the timing.  Its not really possible to see how much gas it has left in the system, just drain it and refill.

Either way, if the re-gas has worked and continues to work for the foreseeable, they kind of took the piss and definitely lied to you about it running out from full in 5 months.  Im sure AC re-gassing wouldnt be covered under warranty due to fine print as there was no damage to anything and is likely seen as a consumable."

I am retired and still I know nothing about cars. So not a boy racer. 

These days I don’t do a lot of driving but I do enjoy a longer drive up to Scotland from Shrewsbury, or to family in Leicestershire.

1m7bhsc,Ideas for replacing a remapped Audi Avant?,"I bought a B6 Audi A4 Avant for £800 three + years ago which has been amazing for the cash but I think it’s unlikely to make it through the next MOT. 

My previous first car was an old-style 2003 Honda HRV (£1200) which was nice in its retro styling ways and did me great for 7 years till it’s sills rusted out, but it would take a while to get up to speed when joining motorways, coming off roundabouts etc. Overtaking sometimes required an extra bit of planning and a fair wind which didn’t make for relaxing driving.

Basically the Audi has spoiled me a bit i! It seems ridiculously torquey and no bother to overtake when needed, which feels safer than what I used to experience.

Downsides it are it smells of oil or diesel in the vents when driving, it’s a bit of a low firm ride that now communicates every bump and my partner finds it a bit bulky to drive so avoids it. 

I’m wondering what to do when it comes time to replace… could afford to spend more this time, but also it’s been working out ok.

Need a ULEZ friendly vehicle. 

Considering so far: 
Honda Accord, seems ultra reliable but road tax for some of these is now £395 so probably rules that out. 

Honda Civic, petrol or diesel, swithering whether to go Diesel for torque &amp; cheap £35 tax but might run into DPF problems in long run as length of journeys I do can be pretty mixed one month to next. Love the space in these with magic seats and estate version load space seems even bigger than Audi. 

(Having an estate has been so convenient even though I would never have set out to get one in first place).

Mazda 6 estate petrol version also seems quite well regarded. 

Mercedes C or E class estate. Mainly for the comfort after feeling every pothole in my spine  of late 😂 Worried one of these could eat money bills-wise though and I’d need to up my budget for a decent example.

Anything else I should consider? 

Budget - thinking upto around 6k, but since bangernomics has served me decently can’t  decide whether to just aim for something for 2-3k (like Civic), see if I can get another 4+ years out of it. Or alternatively spend 6k get it undersealed and hopefully feel confident it’ll last nearer to a decade all being well.

Grateful for anyone’s experience with some of these models, especially around practicalities of being able to overtake. 

Have driven an Octavia for a month and it was nippy but I didn’t really like the boot and visibility in it (sacrilege on here I know - sorry 😆).

Thanks for any thoughts!

In practice, the annual test will check that items placed in or stuck to the windscreen or surface damage, cracks or discolouration in the windscreen do not seriously obscure the vision of the driver. In order to better define what maybe permissible the windscreen is divided into zones:

* Zone A is a vertical area 290mm wide, centred on the steering wheel and contained within the swept area of the windscreen (this area is 350mm wide on vehicles over 3.5 tonnes);
* Zone B is the remainder of the swept area of the windscreen

For simplicity, surface damage, cracks or discolouration, are simply referred to as damage.

In Zone A, a single damaged area shall be contained within a 10mm diameter circle. A combination of minor damage areas shall not seriously restrict the drivers view. Windscreen stickers, or other obstructions, shall not encroach more than 10mm.

In Zone B, a single damaged area shall be contained within a 40mm diameter circle. Windscreen stickers, or other obstructions, shall not encroach more than 40mm.

Windscreen repairs shall be assessed the same as unrepaired damage and shall not restrict the driver’s vision.

Cracks passing through the swept area of the windscreen and reaching two points at the edge shall be deemed to render the windscreen insecure.

Items placed in, or stuck to, the windscreen could be stickers, pennants, satellite navigation monitors or decorations.

Original vehicle design features and drivers aids, such as sun visors, are allowed.

Vehicles that do not comply with the above could be construed to be in contravention of the legislation.

Additionally, Regulation 100 of The Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 (SI 1986 No. 1078 as amended) requires:

* a motor vehicle, and all its parts and accessories;
* the number of passengers carried, and the manner in which any passengers are carried in or on a vehicle; and
* the weight, distribution, packing and adjustment of the load of a vehicle

to be at all times such that no danger is caused, or is likely to be caused, to any person in or on a vehicle or on a road.

Further to this, Section 40a of The Road Traffic Act 1988 (as amended by Section 8 of the Road Traffic Act 1991)Part II, Using a Vehicle in a Dangerous Condition, states that:

A person is guilty of an offence if he uses, or causes or permits another to use, a motor vehicle or trailer on the road when:

(a) the condition of the motor vehicle or trailer, or of its accessories or equipment, or  
(b) the purpose for which it is used, or  
(c) the number of passengers carried by it, or the manner in which they are carried, or  
(d) the weight, position or distribution of its load, or the manner in which it is secured, is such that the use of the motor vehicle or trailer involves a danger of injury to any person.

I’m 21 and have been driving for about 2 years now. I’ve got 1 year of no claims coming up in a month, and I’m currently driving a 2011 Skoda Superb 2.0. Solid car, but I know its gonna need big maintenance soon at 104k miles

I make anywhere from good money depending on how hard i work lol, and I’ve got a decent chunk sitting in investments/businesses. I prefer keeping my money working for me, so I’d be financing a car with a good deposit rather than buying outright. I’ve also got guaranteed income for at least the next 3 years.

The main reason I’m looking to upgrade is for more comfort and quality of life. having something nicer will actually help me make more money too.

I’ve been looking at Mercedes mainly for the interior and that luxury feel. Specifically:

* C300 AMG Line Premium Plus (around £20K)
* CLA 250 AMG Line Premium Plus (around £21K)
* A220 or A250 AMG Line Premium Plus (around £18K–£20K)
* Maybe even an a35 around the same price

I’m considering 2018 or newer, and under 60K miles.

I purchased this vehicle 3 years ago with the mileage around 68,000. The vehicle has been regularly serviced and maintained. At around 92,000 miles the timing chain had snapped + turbo gave way. 
I ended up paying close to £3300 for an engine replacement (new engine mileage 47k verified) + new turbo. This process took around a month due to myself having to find a replacement. 

Currently the mileage has now approached 103,000 (new engine mileage 57k) and I’m concerned the vehicle at this point is going to lose a lot of value. If i sell the vehicle now current market value indicates i would get between £8000 - £10,000.

I’ve got a 2015 Mazda 3 Sport Nav (manual, petrol), around 65,000 miles. I've owned it for \~3 years and it's mostly been driven in Scotland (Glasgow, Aberdeen) and mainland Europe. The car drives well, has a full service history, and hasn't given me any serious trouble until recently.

A couple of weeks ago the rear shock absorber failed in Europe, and the rear anti-roll bar and coupling rods have *snapped due to rust*. I took it to a trusted garage and they basically said:

""More things will start to fall off in the next 1–2 years due to corrosion.""

Apparently, Mazda's underbody rust protection is known to be subpar in this generation, and Scottish winters + salted roads haven’t helped.

* **Keep it and ride it out** (risk MOT fails, compounding repairs, eventual scrap value),
* or
* **Sell it now while it still drives fine** and has some resale value (\~£3–5k privately, less via dealers).

People will disagree, but the most optimal financial way of buying and running a car is as follows:

Buy a 3-4 year old car with c30k miles on the clock (so used well doing roughly 10k miles/year) with FSH. Finance using a low interest bank loan if you don’t have cash lying around. Most of the depreciation has already happened.

Religiously service the car at required intervals. At some point you will own the car outright and bar servicing and maintenance the car will cost you nothing.

My car just had an MOT at 122k miles and had its first advisory. It needs some new lower suspension arms. On paper, it’s quite an expensive job at £500. But some people spend that per MONTH on a new car on PCP that they don’t own at the end of it.

The only reason I will get rid of this car is because it will have a catastrophic failure not worth replacing (e.g. DSG gearbox failure or engine failure) and i’m not kidding myself that the only reason I would change is because I want a shiny new car, not because it is financially sensible.

Bought my 2017 Audi A6 for £17k back in Oct 2020 with 48k on the clock (before used car prices went mental). Now sat at 123k fully paid off. Excluding maintenance it has cost me 22.3p/mile - this continues to reduce all the time. I plan to run for another 2 years, by which time it will have roughly 150-160k on the clock."

I bought my 2004 Honda civic just under 2 years ago as my first car. My dad had one from new and I absolutely loved it so it’s amazing having one of my own. Apart from a sticking break calliper and a rattling input shaft bearing the car has been absolutely flawless over the 6 and a bit thousand miles I’ve driven it. The car itself has only done about 55,000 miles. Previous MOTs have been a few deteriorating break lines and cracked tires, nothing ever seriously wrong. I have never had the chance to deal with taking my car in for an MOT myself as I’m in full time education so my dad takes it in for me. 


—&gt; My car failed its most recent MOT for its tires which is not at all surprising as they are visibly cracked and I’ve just been waiting for it to reach a point where it had to be done. 
However worryingly it also failed for

•Offside Rear Suspension component mounting prescribed area excessively corroded significantly reducing structural strength outer sill (5.3.6 (a) (i))
 

I can’t find the area that this is referring to which confuses me. I know that my car has a bit of rust at the back of the sills, it has done from when I bought it but it’s never failed a MOT for it and the rust is limited to the very back part within the wheel well.  I’m properly into my cars and have spent time underneath it changing my gearbox oil to try and prolong its life. It didn’t think it looked anywhere near that level of corroded. What confuses me even more is that the guy who did the MOT apparently told my dad that my car would most likely need lots of welding work doing in the near future and wouldn’t be worth putting any money into, after he give him the number of his mate who does mobile welding. My exhaust is still silver, as is the crossmember all the rear suspension attaches to, stabbing about with a screwdriver didn’t reveal any obvious rust spots when I crawled under my car on the grass outside my house.

I’ve never used this garage before so my questions are 
1. Does this sound dodgy? 
2. Should I take it somewhere else for a second opinion? 
3. What does “excessive corrosion” look like in terms of failing an MOT? 

Last question that I almost forgot. Do you think I could ask a different MOT place  for 10-15 mins of time where they can verify that my car is/isnt badly corroded and show me where it is rather than booking it in for another MOT?

I’m young and definitely not an expert but something feels really wrong about the disconnect between what I’ve been told by this garage and what I can actually see under my car.
