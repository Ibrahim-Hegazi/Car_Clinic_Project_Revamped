1oz18rc,Should I replace the head gasket or swap in a JDM 2AZ-FE for my 2003 Camry?,,1,1763337364.0,4,MechanicAdvice,1763408168,2025-11-16 23:56:04,2025-11-17 19:36:08,"Bubblewhale (Score: 2): Problem I found online with these JDM 2AZ-FE is that there's no guarantee which year is it. Usually the year range that they advertise is 02-09. It might have the crappy piston ring issue instead that came with 07-09. 

There's many reports that when people had their stripped head bolt threads, they used the timesert/ns-300l kit and it ran with no issues afterwards(Toyotanation). This issue was a lot more common on 02-04 Camry i4s, 05-06 had a fix with manufacturing process which seen less numbers. 07-09 had the low tension piston rings and 0w20 which caused the oil burn issue.

Personally I'd rather ask the dealer which process they're doing with re-threading, and if they're doing a proven method then I'd see no harm with that route especially since it'll be nearly no cost for you."

Another potential issue could be moisture in my fuel lines but how would I even go about testing that let alone fixing that, a new filter and to bleed the lines maybe?

You must spin 2 revolutions because if you don’t the sprocket will be 180 out. So I spin for 2 revolutions I pop my head back up and I’m confused both of the yellow marks are gone but the engine is still in timing. It’s perfect everything is lined up but I notice one of the yellow lines is in a totally different spot and the other yellow line rubbed off on the water pump.

I pulled on the fitting and the leakage stopped at least for now. Before that I would have to tap the gas pedal to get the engine to turn over obviously because there was a fuel supply issue. Now the car runs smoother and there is no need to tap the pedal at all to start. I am hoping I got lucky and that my pulling on the fitting somehow reset the seals. I know this is a common issue with this engine and the o-rings are tricky to find and replace. There is a kit by Dorman but I am not sure this is a job for a non-professional especially since it involves fuel.

I am a 22-year-old female and I used to go to my dad for all my car issues or questions but my dad has passed away so figuring out what car to get has been really hard for me. I just graduated college and I got a job that is over an hour away. Right now I have a 2007 Saturn view with over 200,000 miles on it. I need to find an affordable car that is good for commuting. Also, that is good with different weather conditions because I live in Michigan. With living in Michigan, we usually have pretty tough winters so I will have to drive through very snowy conditions and icy roads. I’m at an entry level position so I do not make a lot of money so I was thinking about getting a used car, but I just don’t know what type of car I even should get. I definitely think I would be most comfortable in something that’s a little bigger than a car maybe like a compact SUV or something like that only because it makes me feel safer in the snow.

Unfortunately the best all wheel drive crossover I know of is a Subaru Outback but when the head gaskets blow you’re going to be in a bad situation until you can get it fixed. In my opinion, if that Saturn runs, run it until it drops the motor, transmission, or rusts to the point of being unsafe and save money for something nicer in cash.

It will leak as you're going down the road and leave almost no evidence behind.

A good way to find a leak is with a cooling system pressure test kit. This is done with the engine cold so there's no scald hazard.  It's really just a special coolant cap and a hand pump and gauge so you can pressurize the system with a cold engine. Really simple to use, just top off the coolant, connect the pump and bring the pressure up to the value stated on the coolant cap. Fifteen, sixteen and twenty PSI are pretty common. Once it's up to pressure start looking for the leak. A bright flashlight, a small hand mirror and a camera will help here. If the pressure drops before you find anything, just pump it back up and keep looking.

Some auto parts stores will have the pressure test kit as a loaner tool. It is my understanding that Auto Zone no longer offers this as a loaner.

You can also get a UV dye that you add to the coolant. You run the car for a few days until you see a drop in the coolant level, and then hunt for traces of the dye with a UV lamp. If you don't have any luck with a pressure test kit, try the UV dye."

Try a short blast of starter fluid\* in the throttle body before trying to start it. If it fires and runs even just a few seconds it will verify that it has spark, and this is a fuel delivery issue. You'll need to replace the connectors, or improvise a way to make them stay tight. Many connectors can de-pinned allowing you to replace the shell and locking parts of the connector without cutting and splicing wires. Sometimes you can fit zip ties around the connector or wire and anchor them somewhere. I've also seen RTV used to hold connectors in place. If you try this, clean the mating surfaces well and allow the RTV time to cure before trying to start the car.

The engines still make produce it, it just gets caught in the DPF now. Once the DPF has a lot of soot stored up, say 70% capacity, the ECU starts a cleaning procedure where it causes the exhaust to get extremely hot, which burns the spot in the DPF into ash.
Most of the material is removed, but the ash remains. Now the filter is at maybe 1% capacity, but filled with ash that it can't remove.
Over many cycles the filter accumulates enough ash that it can no longer efficiently go through that process of soot capture and burn, and you get the warning message you're seeing.

DPF cleaning generally involves adding a chemical that can dissolve and remove the ash, to empty the filter. Different products and approaches have different effectivenesses, but yes this can absolutely work. It might not be like brand new, but it doesn't need to be.

1oyp3zx,1999 CRV with rod knocking -- what are my options,"First Gen CRV with 120k miles. Currently on a road trip, significant rod knock started. I'm ~3 hours from home, so I either need to get it repaired locally or get a long-ass tow. Shops currently all closed on Sunday. Some questions:

- should I attempt to drive it home? It would be massively more convenient to deal with this where I live. Would it be dumb as hell to tow it all the way home?

- is a repair at all worth it over getting a new engine?

- is it even possible to get a new engine for a car this old? Do I need to go find one from a junkyard CRV?

- what would you do? Should I just leave and try to handle all of this shit over the phone? If I do leave, where do I even leave my car? All the mechanics are closed and I'm not able to talk to anyone. I could leave it at a shop, but given then probably the majority of shops in town can't address this issue, it would need to be towed anyway

1oyoys1,P2567 -02 and U0286 -00 Radiator Anti-Tamper Sensor Problem,"Repair order from Volvo dealership.  And radiator part number. 
alright I’ve been chasing this check engine light, I’m trying to flip this. let me explain what I’ve done so far. this is kinda long because I’m trying to be as detailed as possible. Skim it, idc, but please help if you can.

Based on research I did, I thought it might be a bad sensor and so I tried removing the sensor from the original radiator in which attempt I poked a hole in the radiator.

Bought a Volvo OEM radiator from FCPEuro. Installed it cleared the code, it drove without a check engine light for a couple of days - this was awesome. But eventually it came back on.

I was stumped. I read the Tech Journal about how it needs a ECM Upgrade. I don’t have VIDA or the desire to pay the money it costs for the membership and all that stuff. and so I took it to the dealership ready to pay a Volvo tax.

Long story short they blamed the brand new genuine Volvo part as faulty. They said there weren’t any updates available for the ECM and gave it back to me.

So I wanted to believe the dealership was telling the truth. In an attempt to fact check them I did some testing with a multimeter.

I plugged the sensor in, backprobed the signal wire on the sensor and it came back reading ~ 10v steady. (note battery was at a healthy 12.5v) I can’t seem to find information about what it should read at, but seeing it’s a LIN communication device I think it should be less than that and it should be fluctuating up and down. Right?

Also when the sensor is unplugged the signal wire from the harness side reads 0v.

With this voltage reading I assumed the sensor was bad. Plus all I could find online (which isn’t a lot) made it sound like this means this sensor is bad.

So I got FCP to mail me a replacement radiator. I took out the new radiator and the “new new” one got here.

So after getting the “new new” radiator, I haven’t installed it yet but I plugged in just the sensor by leaning it up against the front bumper, and it has the same voltage readings. So there’s no WAY that I got two faulty sensors.

So the tech journal says that if you have the two codes I have together without history of an alternator code perform an “ECM Upgrade”. I thought Volvo might’ve known what that meant and did it. But they said they checked for any available updates.

That’s not what this is saying I don’t think. I’m pretty sure it needs a reflash, like remove the current ecm software and reinstall it. Off and on again type thing.

but I honestly have no idea if that’s true or not. Was the dealership just not knowing where to look?

is there something I don’t understand about this system?

is that signal wire voltage normal?

Im out of ideas. I’m going to just reinstall this “new new” radiator and take it to a Volvo (non-dealership) shop and ask them specifically if they can do a reflash for this. That’s my last guess.

But if someone here has some awesome Volvo Lin communication knowledge to dispel on me I would be most grateful",1,1763307941.0,3,MechanicAdvice,1763408168,2025-11-16 15:45:41,2025-11-17 19:36:08,"Slow_Tale8694 (Score: 1): Sorry I needed to add the whole body idk why it removed the main message.

AsstBalrog (Score: 21): My dealer keeps overfilling my oil, and I used this method too--I just used some clear vinyl ""aquarium"" tubing like this to remove the excess oil. Worked fine the first couple of times, then got stuck like this next time. Tried pulling, and wouldn't come out. Not melted (cold engine) just stuck. I said many bad words, then luckily, pulled harder and it came out.

So I get where you're at here. But I'm not sure towing it to the dealer is your best first step--not sure they could do anything besides that (mechs at my dealer said they have never encountered this). The next time my dealer overfilled, I went to the dealer to have the overfill drawn down, and they have a machine that uses a stiffer plastic hose--that white-ish  stuff, like they use for icemaker refrigerators--very rigid. (I have bought some and used it since--this has worked fine) so what I'm saying is it your dealer may not have direct experience with this problem, since they use different tubing.

I'd suggest two things before you tow. If you have any tubing left over, test pulling on it and see how much pulling it will take--seems like this kind of material will take a fair amount of pull, and stretch a fair amount before pulling apart. Testing will tell you that, and how much stretching it will take.  Then use a Sharpie to mark the actual tube right where it comes out of the dipstick.

Wait until Monday morning, and call the dealer, if they do know (of course it's possible they have run into this) they can tell you what to do, or you can tow it in.  If they don't know, you can still try pulling, since you will know how hard you can do it, and how far you can safely move the Sharpie mark. I understand your caution, but I suspect you can pull harder than you might think.

If pulling doesn't work, you can still take it in, and see what they can do. Might want to also call some indie shops--they work on a wider range of makes, and if some cars are more prone to this than others, they might be more likely to have encountered this.

Best of luck to you--I certainly understand your concern.

PS: DDG sez other, more involved solutions--probably still a trip to the dealer:

Next, they suggested it was the valve stem seals, so those were replaced but the issue persisted. Then they thought it might be the PCV valve, so they changed that along with the rocker cover. Still, no improvement.

When this issue first appeared on B46 engines BMW authorized turbocharger, ventilation valve, both lines and the upstream (B1S1) O2 sensor, hinting they had no idea what was causing the problem and were just firing part broadsides to keep customers happy. Later they switched to replacing the two ventilation lines only and this fixed 90% of cold start smoke issues. In both cases the customer was told to drive the car continously for 2-3 hours to fully burn off any oil left in the intake or to just be patient.

1oyhch4,Should I repair my 2017 Nissan Pathfinder or sell it as-is? Need advice.,"Hi everyone, I could use some honest mechanic and financial advice.

I have a 2017 Nissan Pathfinder with 168k miles. The timing chain was having a problem and it's not working from a month ago... let's say engine is blown, and the shop quoted me $2,700+ just for the engine, not including labor, gaskets, fluids, or towing. Total repair cost looks like $5,000+.

The car is currently NOT running.

I’m debating whether to fix it or sell it as-is.
Option 1: Repair

Engine: ~$2,700

Labor: ~$1,800

Misc parts/fluids: ~$400

Tow: ~$120
Total: ~5k+
Concern: The CVT has 168k miles and I’m worried it might fail later, which would be another $3k–$5k.

Option 2: Sell as-is

The Pathfinder is clean overall. I haven’t repaired anything.

What's the life expectancy of the vehicle after repair?

How much money do you have to purchase a reliable vehicle?

For me, I look at how much it costs me monthly to maintain my vehicles versus how much it would cost me monthly to buy a vehicle. For example, I purchased a 2006 Tundra in 2019 for $8600. Purchase price plus maintenance divided by the number of months I've owned it comes to $230/month. If I had to replace it with a new truck, that would cost me $700/month. Another used truck (assuming financing), $400 a month. My truck is reliable and I'm replacing components on my own schedule to maintain reliability. Lets pretend I have a $5,000 repair cost. That will push my per month cost of the vehicle to $299. That's still short of a used replacement vehicle. If I expect that repair to maintain reliability for the next year my monthly cost will go down to $250. 

So, as long as I expect continued reliability, a $5000 repair on a 20yo vehicle is perfectly fine. 

As long as the numbers work, in your case, then a $5,000 repair should be fine. If however, your monthly cost of owning that vehicle is hitting replacement costs and you expect it to stay there due to general unreliability, then maybe a replacement vehicle is where you need to look.

When your guy adjusts it, have him check:

Pilot & main jets..must be completely clean

Mixture screw ..start around 1.75 turns out

Vacuum lines ..these crack with age and cause bogging

Fuel petcock flow ..weak flow = bogs under load


The good news is the engine itself sounds solid. This isn’t electrical. It’s not the CDI, not the belt, not compression.  Its just fuel/air. Once th is cleaned or replaced and tuned right, it should run like it’s supposed to.

1oyfd0m,Volkswagen Taigun explosion in Kerala — seeking technical and legal guidance,"Posting to request input from automotive engineers, forensic experts, and legal professionals regarding a **Volkswagen Taigun 1.0 TSI AT** explosion in Kerala on **20 Oct 2025**.

# Incident summary

The vehicle stalled three times while entering the house gate. Each time it stalled, the DRLs turned off. After the third stall, the driver restarted the engine, and approximately ten seconds later the car exploded while moving slowly. A second explosion occurred a few seconds later. CCTV footage exists.

The driver suffered severe burns and was treated at Calicut Medical College, then Baby Memorial Hospital, and later airlifted to AIIMS Delhi, where he passed away on **28 Oct 2025**. Before losing consciousness, he repeatedly stated that something was wrong with the car and that the blast originated internally during ignition.

# Questions requiring expert input

1. Can an internal explosion occur during ignition in this engine type?
2. Could the sequence of stalling and DRL shutdown indicate an electrical, ECU, or fuel-system failure?
3. Could improper repair or structural compromise lead to an ignition-related explosion?
4. What is the correct process to initiate an **independent automotive forensic investigation**?
5. How should evidence be preserved and documented so the case is not classified as a generic “accidental fire”?
6. What legal mechanisms are appropriate here (consumer court, NCDRC, civil liability, or criminal negligence inquiry)?
7. Can the manufacturer be required to cooperate in an independent examination?

1oyf4ti,Ram 2500 taillights won’t work but brake lights do (same bulb),"I have a 2024 ram 2500 tradesmen. Recently the tail lights don’t work when I turn on the headlights (Which come on). However, the brake lights do work when I press the brakes. I checked the taillight bulbs, and the filament seems to be intact. I checked the fuses with an electric circuit tester in the TIPM. 8 of them do not work. 
Specifically these:

•  F58
•  F62
•  F42
•  F74
•  F80
•  F68
•  F55
•  F53

I inspected those fuses they were all intact and not blown. 

I also checked the battery power distribution module, and pressed in the plugs just to make sure. There is 110 V micro fuse in there That is also intact but not getting any power.

Some additional context. I recently hauled about a yard per trip of D1 gravel and then topsoil. Some of it got in the crevice between the bed and the tailgate And was resting on the wire in between. I live in Alaska and it’s about 9° right now, there was a hard piece of ice with grit pressing down on that wire.  I removed the ice this evening. It didn’t change anything (the taillights are still off) but I think it was putting pressure on that wire. There didn’t appear to be any visible damage, but I’m gonna have to look at the harness and see if anything got pulled or severed.

Any ideas on what this might be? Is it the TIPM or did the harness get messed up?

1oyzt7s,Purchased car with prior engine damage,"Hey guys, I’m going through a rough debacle right now with a modified car. I just want to know a few things before I reach back out to the dealership on Monday. I purchased the car from a small family owned dealership with modifications already done. The owner of the dealership drove the car as his daily. He had it for sale on facebook and I purchased it while I was in north carolina. For transport to me he had someone drive the vehicle from kansas. I purchased it back early September of this year and took it to my local tuner shop in October. Upon inspection they noticed the tune file was questionable. They did a dyno run to confirm the previous tuners work and the front seal ended breaking and leaking oil due to excessive crank case pressure of 22 psi, these cars should be at about 14/15 psi. Shop did lots of digging and could not figure out the restriction causing so much pressure. They eventually found the compression on all cylinders were at 105 the lowest and 120 the highest. This is very low, with all the signs and other things in the tune my shop points at an issue with the bottom end of the motor being bad, likely the pistons and rings. NOW, I am wondering what leverage I have here. I already spent so much on the repair after the seal broke. Dealership said since it’s been over 2 months they can’t buy it back. They asked for me to get a gm dealership to verify the issue and they would offer me $1,500 if motor work is needed. This does not seem fair but this was just an honest and genuine approach as I don’t want to take it higher yet. What do you guys think. This might be confusing to some but overall wanting to know what I can do for purchasing a vehicle with prior engine damage causing the car to make over 100hp less that what it should!

Its going to be civil and your going to need a lawyer and younhave to prove to the court that dealer knowingly sold you a damaged vehicle. Its going to be tough or impossible to prove it, its also going to cost you a ton of money with lawyers. If the dealer is willing to put 1500$ to repairs thats probably your best deal in my opinion.

1. **Your car has artificial-photosynthesis panels** (like solar panels, but they make fuel instead of electricity).
2. These panels use **sunlight + CO₂ + water** to slowly make an energy-rich fuel like:
   * methanol
   * hydrogen
   * synthetic gasoline
3. The fuel is stored in a **tank**, just like gas or hydrogen.
4. The **engine burns the fuel**, producing power.
5. The CO₂ released by the engine is captured back later by the panels.

This is just like:

* Solar → Battery → Motor
* Photosynthesis → Fuel → Engine

Same logic, different storage.

Best answer I can give for your question is to either get something designed for higher speeds (think Mercedes or BMW, built for the Autobahn), or at least lower your Camry by an inch or two, beef up the sway bars and links, wider higher-quality tires on wider wheels, and upgrade your brakes while you’re at it.

He said that for now, I need to make sure that the oil is topped off and to check every time I pump gas.

I'm including multiple pictures - each time was after wiping clean and re-inserting for 3 seconds.

But any more than that you risk blowing the oil pan off.

1oyo1ff,Take 5 Destroyed My Engine.  Lawyers See The Wrong But Won’t Take Case.,"Premise: Oil change company destroyed engine, confirmed by second opinion. Car was repair by extended warranty. Coverage was fully exhausted due to the extensive damages. Lawyers would take the case but won’t since the damages were paid for by extended warranty.

The details

February 19, 2024, my husband took our car to Take 5 to get an oil change by March 1st, complete engine failure. Had a representative from Take 5 to come out to my job to check the vehicle as to me, it was too risky to drive. The gentleman took time to look in the oil well and stated that there was no oil. He went to the store to get some oil and came back to put it in the car. When he did so and I pressed on the gas, just a little all the bit of oil he poured into the car spilled out. He took a further look and stated that the oil housing was cracked, and there was no oil in the car. He said there was no way that I will be able to drive the car back and that the car would need to stay here and be told to his Take 5 location.
They gave $250 towards a rental.

This gentleman spilled a lot of beans about Take 5 and their practices and that Take 5 is negligent in the damages of several cars recently and have had to pay out. Take 5 took our car in for a third-party examination, it was one of their own private institutions,. They stated that there was no damages on their end that it was due to wear and tear. We literally only had the car for a year and a half and this car had never had a sign of any damages like this as we’ve gotten an oil changes before. To make the story shorter we took the car to get a second opinion same thing was confirmed they found metal shards in the oil, housing, and Infiniti confirmed. 

I stressed about how to pay this as the bill within infinity stated that it would be 23,000 to repair this car. My husband and I didn’t have this money and we sure didn’t have any money to try to go get another car while we still owe on this car. Thanks to having Max Care, they were able to pay most of the bill, but it exhausted our benefits and left us basically vulnerable with no protection for the car. When I’ve consulted with lawyers about it, they see the wrong, they saw the pictures had Infiniti to even confirm that the damages were due to a bad oil change, but they will not take the case due to Mac Care having paid the claim. 

Take 5 needs to pay something because we don’t have any protections over the vehicle and they destroyed our car. We lost time from work, had to pay for rentals. I was stranded. Wasn’t able to pay the car note for trying to figure out how to pay for the damages for this car before learning that MaxCare would pay most of the claim. What can I do?

Part of the problem is that people want things cheap and then they get upset with cheap services. Things are cheap for a reason. When I entered the industry, I heard someone say that you can get a job done fast, cheap, or good, but you can only get two of those at a time. That saying has stuck with me because it's painfully true. 

But none of that really helps you and I'm not trying to just be negative here, so let me make a suggestion: Try to get a whole bunch of people who have been ""wronged"" by Take 5 and try to get a class action lawsuit together. I used quotation marks because while some people have had their cars damaged, others just received the poor service that they paid for and weren't happy about it. 

Get people who have actually incurred damages due to their incompetence and try to recoup some money as a whole. You won't get the full amount, but you should be able to get something to help you. Then stop going to cheap places to have work done."

As this place sounds like they are operating a shady business, go over the contract and look for discrepancies within the contract (ie. number of payments does not reflect the listed full purchase price). Anything you find can help you challenge the listing of it on your credit report. I doubt they will though, I made the same mistake in my youth and i let them come get it.

Cracks can be smaller than what is visible, too. Its been shocked quite heavily, theres a good chance its cracked.

There are tests that can be done but it depends on the cost IMO. If its a stock wheel from a common trim and you can find a match at a pull-a-part, that helps.

37's, 6-inch RC lift.

I was driving home, and this noise, specifically from the front right side of my truck, started happening. There was some construction on the road, and I drove over a couple of rough patches, but I guess I hit a patch too hard, ran over like a pothole, and this noise started happening. I honestly thought a rock was just stuck in my tire or something at first.

It was a 2-hour and 30-minute drive back home, and this noise was playing aggressively for the first like 40 minutes, then it went silent for basically the rest of the drive, with it coming back very slightly here and there. Parked the car to get me some canes, started it back up again, and the noise was back, just as loud as before. I really can't emphasize how loud this sound really is.

1oym8m7,"Baffling 5A Parasitic Drain on Kia Venga 2015 1.4 - Remote Locking Dead, All Roads Lead to BCM. What's Your Take?","Hi everyone,

I'm chasing a really stubborn parasitic drain on my 2015 Kia Venga (petrol) and could use some collective brainpower. I've done a lot of legwork but have hit a point where I need some outside perspective.

The Core Symptom:

· A massive ~5A parasitic drain that is isolated to the 10A ""Luggage"" fuse.
· When this fuse is pulled, the drain disappears (down to 0.02A), but my remote keyless entry stops working completely. I have to use the ignition and the dashboard button to lock the car.

Here's the trail of clues I've followed so far:

1. The Usual Suspects (Ruled Out):
   · Boot light and 12V socket unplugged? No change.
   · Aftermarket radio/reverse camera system? Isolated and fused the camera, even installed a proper CAN bus module. Pulling the audio fuse does nothing. No change in drain.
   · OBD scan? No relevant faults except a P0420 (cat efficiency), which seems unrelated.
2. The Preexisting, Possibly Related Issue:
   · My passenger power window has been intermittent for years (""wants to work but can't""). The motor itself is good (swapped sides), and I get correct voltage at the connector. The problem seems to be in the control side.
3. The Deep Dive & Isolation:
   · I disconnected the entire wiring loom to the passenger door (motor and switch). The 5A drain remained. This told me the fault wasn't inside the door.
   · On a hunch, I started disconnecting modules. When I unplugged a specific connector from the Body Control Module (BCM), the 5A drain instantly vanished.
4. The ""Smoking Gun"" Measurement:
   · With the BCM connector disconnected, I tested the car's harness for shorts. I found one wire—a blue one—showing a high-resistance short to ground (~675 Ohms). All other pins were clean (OL or showing normal load resistance like a 42-ohm bulb).

My Current Theory & The Big Question:

All the evidence seems to point to the BCM. The short on that blue wire disappears when the BCM is unplugged, which to me suggests the short is internal to the BCM on that circuit, not in the car's wiring.

I'm leaning towards a failed internal component (like a driver transistor) on the BCM board that's failed shorted, overloading the ""Luggage"" fuse circuit and taking the remote locking down with it. The long-standing window issue might have been the straw that broke the camel's back.

But before I commit to a BCM repair/replace, I wanted to ask:

· Does this logic track with your experience?
· Has anyone seen a BCM fail with a high-resistance short like this, causing such a specific, high-amp drain?
· Is there any other path I should check that I might have overlooked?

Any thoughts or insights would be hugely appreciated. I feel like I'm 95% of the way there, but that last 5% of doubt is nagging at me.

Should I change them?","TLDR: I am leaning more towards not changing the transmission fluids as it's not listed in the owner's manual, and the possibility of hurting the transmission, the differentials is more what I am thinking about replacing, but I am uncertain if that would be beneficial. 

As the title states, I own a 2014 Subaru Crosstrek with 230k Miles, which never had transmission or differential fluid changed. I have posted this question a few different times, but I always get conflicting information. If people do say yes, they state to only do a drain and fill, and NEVER a flush with that many miles. I keep debating it, but with me not having any power issues, slipping, or just being sluggish, I never have. Subaru sources are kinda mixed on this topic as well. The owner's manual I have and ones I look up online claim it to be a ""lifetime fluid"" and you don't need to change it unless you are driving under ""harsh"" conditions. I do not think I necessarily fit into the term, as I usually let the car warm up before driving, don't tow anything, and usually don't take short trips. I do, however, live in the appalchian Mountains and live on a ridge with a dirt road, so I make sure to take care of salt damage and change my air filter due to dust. The only thing listed in the maintenance schedule for both of these are just inspections to make sure its not leaking as they are both sealed systems. My biggest concern is that changing the fluids now after 230k miles will cause more issues than just leaving it alone. Secondly, I am very capable with most things car-related; however, I do not really have the resources to drop the pan on the car after draining the fluid to change filters and all that, nor do I have the scanners to reset the sensors in the transmission that suposedly have to be done when changing fluid, espcially with such differences as these would have. 

The differential fluid is more what I am thinking about replacing when compared to tranny. Would their be any negatives to changing this fluid out with how old it is? This is listed as just an inspect not replace fluid when it comes to the owner's manual.  What do you all think and recommend?

They indeed show that passive regeneration is improved; as you suspected the DPF benefits from higher exhaust temps.  Also (if I'm understanding this correctly) the lower speed of the exhaust flow contributes to a more even particulate capture across the whole DPF, so regen can be faster.

There are some drawbacks though.  There is now a lot more exhaust manifold and other equipment before the turbo, and as such more places where heat can be lost which reduces the energy available to the turbo.   Also there is a lot more thermal mass in the line, so it sort of messes with how it all operates when engine load changes.  Although, the authors do state that with some tuning of boost and EGR this could be accounted for.

One thing not really mentioned in the paper though is the whole packaging thing.  A DPF takes space and gets hot.  Putting it before the turbo means it has to be in the engine bay, and now your intake and boost lines also need to be longer.  I imagine this complicates the whole design for manufacturers.  I also didn't spend too much time searching for other potential drawbacks, so there may be some further disadvantages as well."

In practice there's really no reason to distinguish between red and white ""protocol"", everything that works on the white cluster will also work on the red, including all initialization steps.

Biggest difference is that the white cluster does not support fullscreen mode, whereas red does.

- The trip is less than one mile with speeds under 35 mph.
- My car would start to shudder when trying to accelerate. This is only the second time I got any lights/warnings on the dash. 
- Since the first incident, I let the car warm up for at least ~1 minute before leaving the house. 
- I took it to the dealer after the first time it happened, and they said the only error code was from tire pressure sensors, because “they’re getting old”, but I had those changed out 5 months ago when getting new tires. They then tried to tell me it was the traction control light when it was happening on a dry, straight, road at low speeds.  They said “well it might be the battery since this is the original one” so I did replace the battery after the first incident. 
- Until this, I haven’t had any mechanical issues with the car and have stayed current with all maintenance. 
- The dealer said it was safe to drive and I haven’t had any issues going to/from work or to the dealer to get it checked out until this incident repeated today. 
- I’ll be honest, I don’t know shit about fuck about cars… but it feels like something is wrong (or haunted).

Anyway, clunking noises were the giveaway every time. It gets progressively worse. It was pretty noticeable right after the first replacement, more subtle after the second (and the car seemed to handle better), and this time around it's taken a while to develop into very noticeable and frequent clunking.

It looks more like some hunk of metal got in there and it was hammered on so hard that it formed to the splines. 

Backstory is that I'm pretty sure this is the 2nd time Goodyear has screwed my truck up. About a year or two ago I got an alignment and they told me I needed a mid shaft bearing as well, so they did it. Obviously they had to remove and reinsert the 2 piece driveshaft after this. Well about a month ago a u-joint failed so I replaced it, and getting these spline shafts apart was INSANE. I spent 30 minutes hammering it apart to get it off, and while I was doing it I noticed that the knuckles of the shaft also had a lot of hammer strikes going in the other direction (inserting the shaft). 

Now, I'm not a mechanic, but I don't know any reason it should have been this hard, so I looked up videos and everyone else was able to do it by hand. Well I spun the front shaft 180 degrees to line up the missing female spline with the ""key"" (or bit of swarf stuck in there) on the male splines, and it went together fine. This shaft has 300k miles on it, so with a dent or two this has caused untenable vibration, so I'm trying to rotate it 180 back again (I marked it before taking apart the first time, so I can put it back in the original orientation.)

I tried hammering out the ""key"" with a flathead, and it is definitely softer than the splines, but it won't budge. Should I grind this out, or am I complely barking up the wrong tree? 

Either way I'm so done with Goodyear. ",0,1763326226.0,5,AskMechanics,1763408168,2025-11-16 20:50:26,2025-11-17 19:36:08,"Master-Pick-7918 (Score: 2): Yes, keying is commonly used to index the yoke.  This keeps the shafts in phase, all the u-joints are aligned, and eliminates vibration."

The car is a 2013 Scion FRS with the stock FA20. There is an Act 6 puck clutch kit and lightweight flywheel in the car. The sound is not normal clutch rattle and I’m sure something is broken after some hard driving and standstill traffic on a very steep incline.

The issue is that I need to pass an emissions test in the next few days, but need to create drive cycles since the battery was recently replaced which cleared any data. I’m really wondering if I should just send it and drive the car around as needed for the next few days so I can pass my test or if it needs to be repaired ASAP. I plan to pull the transmission either way, but not sure if it can wait a week.

For some context:

1. The clutch pedal feels fine overall and no different than normal.

2. When taking off in first, there’s a clanking/rattling sound under the hood like something is being thrown around inside the transmission case. It does NOT sound like grinding gears.

3. It’s slightly harder to shift into 2nd, but there are no sounds. 3rd and 4th gear operate as normal.

# Incident summary

The vehicle stalled three times while entering the house gate. Each time it stalled, the DRLs turned off. After the third stall, the driver restarted the engine, and approximately ten seconds later the car exploded while moving slowly. A second explosion occurred a few seconds later. CCTV footage exists.

The driver suffered severe burns and was treated at Calicut Medical College, then Baby Memorial Hospital, and later airlifted to AIIMS Delhi, where he passed away on **28 Oct 2025**. Before losing consciousness, he repeatedly stated that something was wrong with the car and that the blast originated internally during ignition.

# Questions requiring expert input

1. Can an internal explosion occur during ignition in this engine type?
2. Could the sequence of stalling and DRL shutdown indicate an electrical, ECU, or fuel-system failure?
3. Could improper repair or structural compromise lead to an ignition-related explosion?
4. What is the correct process to initiate an **independent automotive forensic investigation**?
5. How should evidence be preserved and documented so the case is not classified as a generic “accidental fire”?
6. What legal mechanisms are appropriate here (consumer court, NCDRC, civil liability, or criminal negligence inquiry)?
7. Can the manufacturer be required to cooperate in an independent examination?

From what I’ve found, there are a few legit ways to get some info without paying full price. Some dealerships still include a free Carfax on their listings, especially on Cargurus and AutoTrader. Carfax’s Garage feature also lets you plug in your VIN and see some maintenance history at no cost. A few banks or credit unions will provide a free vehicle history report when you apply for auto pre-approval.



If you’re open to alternatives, services like AutoCheck and Bumper exist and often have bundle deals, which makes each report cheaper than buying a Carfax one by one.



I’m curious what other people are using in 2025. Are there any reliable, cheap Carfax resellers or alternatives that actually pull data from the real Carfax database? Also, how do you decide when it’s worth paying the full $45 versus sticking with a free or cheaper option?

There were indeed a few issues when restarting: dead battery, weird smell in the ventilation system, front headlights dead. I changed the battery, the smell is slowly going away, and a mechanic did the oil + other fluid change, brake inspection etc, and declared the car good to go.

2.	The rear right panel has some white scratches from another reversing incident, quoted about £500 to fix.

Both jobs need to be done at an official garage.

What’s the best way to deal with this with my insurer? Should I file two separate claims, or is there a way the garage/insurer might handle them together if it’s all being fixed at once?

1oyvqdn,Possible to get a decent car with a £2k budget anymore?,"These days everyone is wanting top dollar for bargain basement. Saw a 2004 bog standard Fiesta for sale recently, nothing exceptional about it. Not the ST, didn't have low miles but they wanted £2k for it. 21 years old. £2k. Nuts! I get why things have gone up - modern throwaway cars & people wanting to stay away from them being one factor.

£2k was always about my budget. Maybe a stretch to £3k but then people start recommending £3k-£4k cars when you say that, whereas I'm coming from the POV of I'd like to spend £2k but I'll push to £3k if I really really have to, it's not an aim.

Recently picked up a 2012 Astra J for just shy of £2k & I'm only a week in but already considering moving it on. To be fair that was mostly my own fault but along the way to buying that one I was constantly coming across just crap that I was forever not entertaining for one or more of a number of reasons.

The last car I bought before this was 7-8 years ago & it really wasn't difficult then for me to go & get something fairly decent. 

Maybe I'm overly choosy now, maybe I'm looking for something that isn't attainable.

Clive1792 (Score: 2): I suppose a lot rides on how willing you are to travel & then how far.

I've been having a rough time with Marketplace personally. A lot of it may be down to me being too judgemental. To explain:

If I see a female seller & click on their profile, I've been coming up with females who seemingly sell a lot of cars. Nothing wrong or anything, but certainly not 'the norm'. When you dig deeper & see their partners page it's littered full of car related stuff & they may not seem quite as 'presentable' to the public as their Mrs so it's a bit of a case of why aren't YOU selling your own stuff then mate?

Profiles of young lads throwing up gang signs as they hold on to their pitbull on a chain - can't be bothered dealing with these people.

There's another group of people who I have dealt with in the past, against the advice or friends & family but each & every instance was a negative one & so now when I see these peoples names/pictures I just scroll on by.

And the vast majority seem to be the latter two groups. While I may see the middle group out & about as I walk through the town, there's very few of the last group but they seem to be the majority on local car sales.

Then there's the cars themselves. Constantly coming up against ""oil leak but not excessive"". I don't want a bloody oil leak on my drive. Had that and it was a PITA to sort.

There's been other cases where some digging puts me off. ""Had this car for 10 years"" ... then when you look when the V5 last changed & it was 2023 or something. Maybe wife & husband changed ownership or something innocent but I just think what else isn't going to be stacking up.

As I say, I'm well aware I may be being overly critical & judgemental. I bought a car for £400 off a relative so if I was in that area then I wouldn't be as fussed but when it starts stacking up a couple £1000 then that's a bit of money (to me) to go wrong, so I'm more cautious.

You're not going to get a black mark with TFS. They deal with early settlements all the time. I settled mine last week after only having it for two weeks out of a three year deal. Saved me £5.8k.

Let's play it another way. You can legitimately sell a car that's financed as long as you settle the finance before you do the V5 documentation.

So, if you have a car worth £10k and it has a £7.5k settlement figure, your buyer pays off the finance directly with the finance company via a non-returnable bank transfer (Faster Payment) and then gives you the £2.5k. Once the payment has been sent, you can do the V5 transfer. Even if it takes a couple of days to show up on the systems, the cleared funds have been sent before you ""sold"" the car and transferred the ownership.

Your credit file will only be affected if you miss payments.

That heated seats “don’t come off the main battery” (which is untrue for any EV)
I relied on this information when deciding to buy.
Here’s what I’m actually getting:
Since my last full charge:
Battery started at 100% (220 miles predicted)
I have driven 52 miles total
Battery is now at 38%, showing only 44 miles remaining
So I’ve used 62% of the battery to travel 52 miles.
This works out to a real-world range of around 82 miles per full charge.
And just to be clear:
I have not been on the motorway at all
All roads have been 30–40mph, which should increase efficiency, not decrease it
Weather has been mild (8–10°C)
Heating used only briefly for demisting
I’ve also had individual short trips where:
19 miles of actual driving used 90 miles of range
0.4 miles used 5 miles of range
3 miles used 10 miles of range
Based on this pattern, real winter months will probably mean 65–75 miles per full charge.
Why I believe this is misrepresentation
Independent testing from EV Database, CarWow, WhatCar, Autocar etc. all show:
Worst-case winter range for the Corsa-e is about 125 miles
That’s at –10°C to –15°C, heater fully on, long continuous journeys
Yet I’m getting 82 miles in mild weather, on slow 30–40mph roads, with minimal heating.
The range I was promised (150–170 winter miles) is completely unrealistic and contradicts all independent data.
I would not have bought this car if I had known the truth.
What Arnold Clark have done so far
Ran one diagnostic → “no faults found”
Blamed the weather (despite temperatures being 8–10°C)
Stopped returning my calls
Branch manager told me I’d need to pay £6,000 in negative equity to exit the finance
Refused to escalate me to head office management
My questions:
Does this count as misrepresentation, since I was promised 150–170 winter miles but the car only delivers ~82?
Should I escalate this to the Financial Ombudsman?
Has anyone else had range this low on a Corsa-e in mild weather?
What would you do next?
Any advice or shared experiences would be massively appreciated. I feel stuck with a car that is nowhere near the range I was promised.",0,1763312904.0,4,CartalkUK,1763408168,2025-11-16 17:08:24,2025-11-17 19:36:08,"UnfortunateWah (Score: 3): TLDR: Not an AC problem as such, it’s a problem you need to take up with Vauxhall if you believe the vehicle is not performing to the expected standard as they warranty the vehicle, not AC (they’re just the intermediary).

1oyr1u6,Advice on buying first car on my own,"Hi Im currently 21 years old and im trying to buy a car soon, Im studying at uni so as much as I wish i could bring my parents or brother with me I wouldnt be able to.

Ive seen a post on facebook market place (toyota yaris) that seems good but just dont want to get scammed and i want to ask a few things.

1. Basics - Im a girl so i feel like theyll take one look at me and my inexperience and try to scam (lol) - was hoping to bring a friend but the place is an hour away and most of my friends are either girls or dont know much about cars either so, whats the best course of action. Would it be worth it to pay a mechanic to come and look at the car with me?
2. Sounds silly but do i just give the cash and walk away with the car? - Im sure theres some sort of documentation involved but im not sure what. Its a private seller so would there be away to ask for a warranty or the ability to bring it back if I dont like it? If the car has issues immedietley can I get my money back or ask him to sign an agreement of some sort?
3. What things I should be looking out for, I've plugged the licence plate into those free check things and the service history looks good so far, no issue that i can see at least but what other things should I check
4. Immediately after - do i take it to be serviced immediately or should i just check the oil/coolant levels myself and decide if it needs to be done
5. Price, its a 70k milage 2008 Toyota yaris auto for 2.3k which I think is decent but want would you think
6. I'm not confident driving on the motorway so I might not be able to bring it home during Christmas - would it be ok to be left without being driven for 3 week in december or would that damage the car?

7. is this a good time to buy a car or should I wait till after Christma?

Once I was happy with the car, the seller showed me the V5C book, I transferred the money, he gave me the green slip that goes to the new owner and I also filled in some of my details for him (name, address), so he could submit the new ownership.

1) how much do you have to spend on a mechanic? (sidenote: how desperately do you need the car?). Worst comes to worst, drag a friend (regardless of gender) who knows about cars - they'll be able to spot any scam attempts for you.

2) there's a lot of stuff involved, registration, V5 logbook etc its not just hand the cash over and take the car. But don't ask me what the stuff is, I've got no clue :)

3) ideally someone with experience should accompany you to check it out. Other kind people will probably tell you what to look out specifically on this model. check tyres, the MOT government website - has it ever had any advisories. has it been fixed?

4) ideally you should check levels before buying, then use it to haggle price. definitely ask for a service history then make a judgement off that.

5) idk. quick search on autotrader shows loads of Yaris's (Yarises? Yari?) under 2.5k with a much lower mileage on them (circa 55k)

6) if you aren't confident, a yaris might not be the best car to start practicing on the motorway. the car (assuming its in a good condition + battery is fine) should be fine for 3 weeks.

I wouldn't pay a mechanic personally but I'd watch a few tiktok and YouTube videos of things to check and look out for, don't let yourself feel pressured into buying just because you've travelled all that way and if you can try to haggle down a few hundred, 70k miles is okay but you want to test drive the car and look around it and check the service history and things before you buy it

itll be fine not being driven for a few weeks, it might flatten the battery but you can jump start it or alternatively just turn it on and leave it running on the drive for 45 mins once a week to keep the battery charged up 

You need a new keeper slip and you need to pay for the tax and insurance before you drive it awayThis slip proves you are the new owner and contains a 12-digit reference number you need to tax the vehicle immediately. You can do it online in minutes.
It's buyer beware/sold as seen for used cars so make sure you're happy with it and if you get any faults you can't take it back.

* *heated seats for those cold mornings, cruise control*. Need a higher spec model for that. If Euro 6 is a must, get a 65-plate or newer in SR trim, otherwise an older EX model is the top pre-facelift spec.

Since then, the car has only cost me in tyres and servicing.  I service myself every 5k or 6 months - whichever comes first. 

I tuned with Mountune a year in at ~30k miles to the M300 package. Ran that for a couple of years.

Double check if the boot is dry when you view. If it isn't try and check under the carpet to make sure it's not rusty. 

The rear axles are renowned for rotting from the inside out. Not a particularly expensive job although at this mileage/ price point probably not worth doing. 

LCD screens for the clock/radio / climate control are known to fail regularly usually starts with bits of the screen not being visible. Personally again at that price point it wouldn't be a deal breaker just one of those things.

When you say ""is it worth it "" also be realistic with your expectations. You should if the car has been looked after get a few years relatively cheap motoring out of one of these. But buying a car at that mileage and price point ain't without it's potential issues.
