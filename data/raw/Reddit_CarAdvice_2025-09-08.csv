1nb6gcg,fuel injector cleaning/flow machine for small shop,"I run a small business doing specialized engine building & service for specific enthusiast cars. Most of the focus of my work is on the engine internals but of course there are times when the owner wants full maintenance and engine service on peripheral parts including fuel injectors.



Over the years I have sent sets of injectors out to a shop like RC, but recently I have had problems with their service, plus of course there is time and money lost in round trip shipping etc. and the car sits immobile in my shop in the meantime. That's a whole other story that I won't go into detail here with. I have found no local shop that has an injector machine, as I am in a rural area.



A few years ago I got one of the chinese injector machines pictured, in an effort to move this service into my own control. But I found the machine of questionable quality (expected of course). Two of the four vials leak, and the cleaning solution pump died within a few weeks (I replaced it with an old fuel pump from a honda civic that I had laying around, it looked identical to the one in the machine). The vials leak fast enough that I cannot get an accurate reading on the injector balance/flow.



I dont want to buy another $300 chinese machine, so I want to take a step up in quality. But I also cannot spend 8 or 10k on a pro shop level machine that I would never be able to break even on. I need to find a machine in the $1000-2500 price range that is of good enough quality to last about a decade and give repeatable results when used once per week or a couple times per month.



I found this machine [https://on3performance.com/products/on-3-performance-injector-flow-testing-bench-injector-ultra-sonic-cleaner-8-cylinder](https://on3performance.com/products/on-3-performance-injector-flow-testing-bench-injector-ultra-sonic-cleaner-8-cylinder) that looks like it would fit the bill for what I need but I thought I'd ask if any shop employees or owners here may have experience with it, or could recommend something similar.



Thanks in advance.

I press on the gas pedal.... Nothing nothing nothing... It's just idling at steady rpms... and then VROOM it revs up really high and shoots forward like all that power was released at once.

The problem is incredibly worse after hard braking and then trying to accelerate again after. My car usually stalls out instead of my rpms going up.

I was just cruising downhill at idle and I had to eventually pull over because I thought the accelerator was toast at this point. Luckily it started working again after I stopped.

1nb4cma,Why else would my car be slow to start?,"Hello!

  
I drive a 2017 Subaru Outback. For the past 6-8 months, my car will be a bit slow to start. Usually, it's in the morning, and it happens about 3-5 times per week. I can always get it to start, but it just takes an extra second or two on these occasions. The rest of the time, it starts with no issue. My first thought was to replace the battery, as it had the same battery in it as when I bought it in 2023 (the dealership didn't provide a new battery, which is fine). I replaced the battery three weeks ago, and for a couple days, the car started perfectly fine. Then, it was slow to start again, though slightly less frequently.

  
I took it to my Subaru dealership yesterday, where I've taken the car to get worked on since I bought it. After doing some reading, I thought it might be an issue with the starter, and so I had the technicians look at it. What they found was a parasitic draw from the car's DCM. I figured this was probably causing the issue, and gave them the go ahead to fix it (which was roughly around $800 to replace the DCM). 

  
Today, the car was slow to start again. I'm a bit disappointed, as I'd hoped the issue would be resolved. Is there anything else that could be going on with the battery, starter, or something else I'm unaware of?

After bleeding, it will work fine for a little bit, but then it goes right back to not working correctly. Sometimes pumping the brakes help, sometimes it doesn’t. Also, when you first start it in the mornings, you have to pump the pedal 6-8 times or you won’t have any brakes.

So, assuming it’s not a faulty new booster or master cylinder that was replaced, is there anything else it could be?",1,1757274876.0,6,MechanicAdvice,1757360040,2025-09-07 19:54:36,2025-09-08 19:34:00,"alpaca-yak (Score: 2): not a mechanic... 

a hydraulic system can only lose compression if there is a leak. you said that you bleed the system and it works fine for a little bit - you have a leak somewhere in the system. I would try pressurizing the system and check for any seepage out of the calipers (piston and bleed screws) and along the lines. a pinhole is enough to let air into the system. I deal with vacuum leaks (same problem but in reverse) in my professional setting and it can take a long time and a lot of patience to work out where the leak is. I would consider replacing the entire brake lines if it were my vehicle.

Nada_Chance (Score: 2): I'll bet you've gotten air into the ABS unit that hasn't been bled out, so you are simply compressing that air into the ABS and it ""feels"" fine, and then when it sets, the air decompresses and you are back to square one. Look up the procedure for bleeding that system. You may need a scan tool for that one."

1nb1e0u,97 Civic (D16y8) Wet fouling plugs and crank no start condition.,"So my civic broke down after getting laid off the other day. Alternator belt rubbed through the Crank Sensor. Figured that was the problem, with the wires being severed, so replaced with an OEM one. Still no start, so check that I at least have fuel, spark, and compression. Don't have a fuel pressure gauge, and compression tester is in storage with my boxes so I don't have exact numbers. Pulled the plugs, and the gap was like a country mile and wet fouled, so replaced them. Cranked and started with fuel cut (WOT), but was very rough and low ram idle / sputtering, and died when I let off throttle. Tried starting normally, and it wouldn't start the rest of the day. Pulled plugs, wet fouled again.

Yesterday, I was able to get it to idle very well after I let the plugs dry off for a couple hours. It ran fine with no hesitation or roughness and super smooth (probably properly gapped plugs helped lol). I let it idle for a couple minutes. Smoked a bit on start up, smelled rich which makes sense based on how fouled the plugs were. I reved it to ~3-4k and when it came back to idle, it died and I couldn't get it to start again.  

I'm at a loss right now. I'm trying to come up with a game plan for today, and I'm between either clogged cat or weak fuel pump but feel I'm missing something. Mainly what's causing the wet fouling? Only thing I can think is either weak spark, all injectors being clogged (all plugs get fouled), or too weak fuel pressure to get the injectors to spray right?

Is this perpendicular and rotational play at the transaxle housing a time bomb or should it be okay for quite a while yet? No apparent leak at the seal. No loud noises while driving.

The original bushing wasn't hard enough steel and slowly wears away.  Eventually it will start leaking.

The transmission in your car is the Ford 6F35.  There is a repair kit that has the new bushing and seal.  The kit part number is K099, and you want the ""thin wall version"".  There is also a kit with the same part number, but a thick wall bushing that will not work in your 2010.  The new bushing is harder steel, slightly longer, has a ""window"" to let transmission fluid fill the space between the bushing and shaft for lubrication, and has a Teflon coating on the inside that contacts the axle shaft.  The part of the axle that contacts the bushing also wears, and may need to be replaced as well.

I spent five hours this past Wednesday replacing that bushing in a 2011 Escape 2.5 liter engine/6F35 transmission with 195K miles.  I did not need to replace the axle.  It was only two months old, and looked fine.   The play at the transmission is gone, and it wasn't leaking when I checked it Friday.

The official special tool to pull the bushing costs about $319.00, and I didn't find anyone offering it as a loaner tool.  I found a YouTube video by a man who made his own tool for the job, and used his design to make my own for $8.00.  It worked.  You also need to obtain or improvise tools to drive the new bushing in and to install the seal.  Ford says to use green threadlocker on the bushing when installing.    

Let me know if you plan to do this job yourself.  I'll write up how I did it, and send some photos I made.

Here is what the old bushing looked like after I pulled it:

1nau75x,Any advice? 2010 Hyundai Santa Fe failure.,"So family friend asked me to put a used engine into their 2010 Hyundai Santa Fe.  It’s been about a year and a half ~20k miles later and had a major issue.  Told them going in this was a gamble, but their old engine had head gasket blown and they drove it with water in the oil.  I told them the bearings were more than likely shot and replacing a head gasket was going to likely be a waste.  Options were, remanned long block, rebuild engine, or get a used engine and roll the dice.  They opted to roll the dice. 

The story was the daughter was driving at highway speed when she saw a ton of smoke, heard a clunking, immediately pulled over and shut off the car.  She said the steering was tough to turn which to me I think means the engine wasn’t running so no power steering.  

I checked the oil and level was good.  I dropped the pan next and really didn’t see anything except this.  Looks almost closer to a rtv piece of the tube or something.  Not magnetic.  There is however a lot of oil under the car but I’m almost thinking it is blown diff or something.  I can’t find the source of the oil but it could have been wiping around under there at highway speeds for who knows how long.  

Should I throw new oil in and start her up?  Or keep disassembling and put a bore scope into the cylinders?   I can’t get to the rear 3 unless I disassemble the manifold.

1natlu8,Warranty void?,"Hi,

I own a 2021 Buick Encore GX 1.3L and this week the check engine light came on, it has the P1467 code for the EVAP purge pump.

Googling for solutions, I came across a GM warrant that stated that some vehicles from 2020-2023, including mine, had a faulty evap purge pump causing the p1467 code. So I thought ""great, I'll take it to the dealership ""

However, once at the dealership I was told that it wouldn't be covered because my car has a salvage title and I would have to pay out of pocket. Is this true? The reason why I ask is because a few years back I had a salvage car that had a recall and the dealership fixed it for free. I just want to know if this info is correct or if I should go to another dealership.

Thanks.

You have to find the leak and replace the seal or gasket causing the issue.

You might need to degrease the lower end of the engine then go back with a bright light and a camera a few days later to get a better look.  The most common oil leak is a valve cover gasket leak.  Even with the valve cover being on the top end, oil flows downhill and can make the bottom end a real mess.  If you still have no luck finding the problem, you can get a UV dye additive that goes in the oil, and after a few days you check it with a UV light.  That can take you right to the source of the leak.  Be aware too that you may have more than one leak.

Some gaskets and seals, like valve cover gaskets, make a good DIY project.  Sometimes getting to the firewall side valve cover involves removing the intake manifold for access.  Other leaks, particularly in the bottom end are best left to the pros for most people

I got curious and started collecting the most common ones I came across from my own experience and from reading other people’s stories. I ended up putting them together into a small PDF for myself, just to keep track.

Honestly, it helped me a ton (instead of panicking when something happens, I just check my notes).

So now I’m wondering: what’s the #1 annoying issue you keep running into with your car? And do you think a little DIY guide with fixes is actually useful, or just another “overthinking project”?

Like if you have an older car with an electric retractable antenna. The only thing that really ever goes bad is the plastic ""gear"" inside the antenna mast itself. Go in the trunk, take the antenna mechanism out of the car, open it up, fish out the old broken gear parts, re-grease everything, then insert a new mast which you can probably buy for about $40.

95% of flaky fickering electrical problems are some corroded or dirty and greasy contacts inside a switch. If you're lucky they didn't plastic weld the whole assembly together and you can just open the switch mechanism and clean it and bend the contacts. Also true for flaky battery contacts in fobs.

I was able to just turn off the car and turn it back on and the engine turned over just fine. When I got home I used my OBD2 scanner and got the code P0335 which coincides with a crankshaft position sensor issue. I changed that out with a new sensor since it is relatively easy to do. After I did that the check engine light went off and it sounds better when it starts but I never drove it. That was last night. This morning I drove it again and right after the cold start (like 2 mins maybe) it stalled on me again. The same process of restarting the engine got it to turn over just fine and I didnt have any issues for the rest of the drive (probably another 5-10 mins). When I got home this morning, I turned the car off and on a few times and the engine sounds better but when the engine first starts the RPMs drop a little and sounds like its about to stall but doesn't. When I ran my scanner this morning, it threw both a P0335 and a P0012 code. My question is what could be going wrong? Is it possible that the camshaft position sensor is now gone bad too? If so, why would the ECU still be throwing the P0335 code? Or is it possible the the crankshaft position sensor wasnt bad and instead theres a timing chain issue or something like that?

1nakwpy,"2005 Mazda Verisa - car won't start, key won't turn","It's the weekend here so can't get any assistance that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, was wondering if there's anything I can do to self-troubleshoot or self-diagnose before Monday hits and I need to make many many phone calls.

TL;DR: car was recently repaired, worked fine Tuesday night, wouldn't work Friday night or now. Key doesn't turn in the ignition beyond the accessories notch, meaning I now have a multi-thousand-dollar radio rather than a car.

Full story: about a month ago, my Mazda was broken into. It was clear the sole purpose was for (trying to) steal the car and none of the contents, because 1) they didn't take anything from inside it, and 2) they broke into two other Mazdas on my street that same night and got away with one of them. The damage was a broken quarterglass and damaged steering column, but they didn't completely destroy the ignition barrel - only enough so that the cap doesn't go on it again, meaning I can't run the car keyless. A new part has been ordered by the company that did the repairs.

I have two copies of the key - one which goes into the remote fob, and one spare. Both worked for about a week and a half after I got the car back, almost fully repaired - we used it on Tuesday night to do a grocery run. However, when I tried to run it on Friday night (and again just now) the key would not turn beyond ACC. I did the normal idiot checks - the car was in park with the handbrake fully on, the steering wheel wasn't jamming the key, and both copies of the key were tried.

I still can't operate the car with the fob alone because the repairers needed to order in a part, which still has not arrived. The car still locks and unlocks from outside with all three unlock methods - button on the fob, button on the door with the fob in range, and manually with a key. It also locks from the inside with the fob button.

Little bit up a gum tree but want to make sure this isn't something I can fix first before making more phone calls to the repairs and to insurance.

So, this means you need or must get to the backside of the plate and garb or re-weld the captive nut into place and then repair the hole or damage to access it.  There is not magic at this point, just pain old destructive work to get the offending bolt out and then repair the damage.

A couple of tips for future reference, clean all bolt holes with a tap before your begin reassembly if it is not really clean or nearly perfect to begin with and ensure the bolts themselves are in good shape or clean those threads as well.  Then loosely start all bolts to ensure they start straight before tightening all of them evenly.  IF you encounter resistance on any bolt, stop and resolve the issue before something breaks off and causes you immense work to repair.  DO NOT just keep going and think you just have a tight bolt and it will clear up.  I've made all of these mistakes personally, and it never ends well.

If I was in your position now, I would remove the control arm using what ever to get that bolt out.  Perhaps drilling it progressively larger until it snapped off, then use a thin cutting disk cut the metal surrounding the captive nut to get it out, then weld in a new nut and weld the metal back to restore it to original shape and condition.  Paint it and reassemble it using the tips from above.

Wheels have standard bolt patterns and sizes. You need to know what your vehicle hub is and what the wheels are. That is the first step. Then you need to understand if they are large enough to clear the calipers but not so large that you will hit the body and full turn. 

From the looks of it, it looks off. The answer is not dremeling and cutting away material. You will introduce stress concentrations to the wheel and your likelihood of the wheel breaking is dramatically increased. That would be a catastrophic failure if it happened. 

Also those seats look like absolute garbage.

I have a 2013 Nissan Versa. I recently had an issue with my brakes when exiting the highway. I barely had any brakes. The pedal went almost all the way to the floor. The brakes work good when driving in town but once you go 60+ mph they don't work well. I've had the car into the mechanic and they are stumped. They say that it doesn't make sense that the brakes work well in town but not after 60 mph. The fluid level is good, and looks good. There are no apparent leaks that I can see. Some people who I have talked to suggest that it's a problem with the master cylinder, the shop that I use is not sure that's the problem. I don't have a lot of money to just throw parts in it to try and figure out exactly what the problem is.

The seals can bypass fluid under high pressure, especially when braking harder at higher speeds.
2. **Brake booster / vacuum issue** If the booster isn’t getting enough vacuum at higher RPMs, assist can drop off, making the pedal feel weak. Check the booster check valve and vacuum line.
3. **Air in the system / old fluid** – Even if the fluid looks fine, if it hasn’t been flushed in years, moisture lowers the boiling point. Long highway braking heats things up and you can get fade from boiling fluid or trapped air. A proper flush/bleed is cheap to try.

Since you don’t want to throw money at random parts, I’d suggest:

* Start with a **full brake bleed/flush** (least expensive).
* If no change, have someone check the **master cylinder** for internal bypassing (often missed because it doesn’t show as an external leak).
* While you’re there, inspect the booster vacuum line plus check valve."

I have a 2018 Golf 1.6 TDI with 180,000 km. The DPF has been removed and it’s on Stage 1.

But sometimes, when I release the gas, the car goes smoothly and the engine braking isn’t as pronounced. I haven’t noticed any patterns-it happens randomly, sadly.

Does anyone have an idea what might be causing this, or is it just normal behavior with Stage 1?

I had a major service done around 10,000 km ago.

Recently had my 2018 GT Performance pack (not performance pack 2) in for an alignment at a reputable shop in town. Had the alignment done because I recently put in steeda linear drag springs.

I had the specs directly from ford and provided them to the shop. Looked it over with em at the end and was pretty happy with it.

The alignment as it sat when I brought it in was all within specs except for the front toe which was decently out, positive I believe - pushing the front of the tires outwards.

that was corrected.

How does the rear toe look to you guys? I thought it was within specs except but some guys are saying otherwise.

Also, are you replacing the entire knuckle, or just the wheel bearing? You might be able to rent tools to press the bearing out and back in without removing the knuckle. FWIW a bearing knuckle/knuckle bearing isn't a thing, so it's just a little unclear what you're doing exactly. You shouldn't typically need to replace the entire knuckle to replace a bearing, but it can be common to remove the knuckle to do the press work out of the vehicle."

I have a Ford Fiesta Mk6 (2011, 1.2 petrol). Yesterday I was updating my aftermarket monitor/radio (just YouTube update, via Wi-Fi) while the engine was off. When I restarted the car, the power windows stopped working – and now every time I press any window switch (front or rear), the turn signals activate instead.

\- Reinstalled the original Ford radio → problem still persists

\- Disconnected the aftermarket CAN-bus box → problem still persists

\- Checked the switches: all four windows have the same issue

\- The issue started immediately after the update, engine off, possibly a low battery voltage situation



My guess is that the BCM (Body Control Module) got “confused” or corrupted because of the voltage drop while the car was off.

1nb2sxj,DSG gearbox slipping out of gear in reverse?,"Hi mechanics! 

I have a 2015 VW passat which has a 6-speed auto DSG gearbox. We recently parked it facing downhill on a fairly steep hill and when we returned needed to reverse out of the parking space - we weren't able to.. Managed to get home once the person in front had moved and narrowed down the issue a little bit more. It seems that on flat, reverse gear works pretty normally as long as you're not too enthusiastic on the accelerator. If you do rev it too much, it seems to slip out of gear (and you lose all power) then there's a bit of a judder and a warning light on the dash to press the brake pedal.

The problem seems to only be in reverse which suggests to me that it isn't a clutch issue so I'm thinking it's a problem with the mechatronics unit? Any other thoughts / ideas?

As an aside, we got quoted £3.6-5.9k at a local gearbox specialist to fully diagnose and fix the issue which seems incredibly expensive.. Looking around a new unit seems to be more within the £2k fitted mark.

If it don't get out and touch the light to the other small pin,,, one of those two HAS to light it, if not you need a new clutch safety switch (Park/Neutral safety switch)

If your light do light up with the clutch switch your relay has a ground, now it needs a power SO,,,

Put your test light to battery negative and the touch the other small pin and then turn your key ahead in the crank position, do it light up ?  If it do light up you have a bad relay, swap it with another relay say from the horn to verify OR you have a broken wire from Pin 87 on the relay down to the starter S post (small signal wire)

If the light doesn't light up it can be a lot of things like security key not recognized or the wire leaving the PCM to the starter relay etc"

1navy0i,"2018 BMW F80 M3, money shifted at 135 mph at Poconos Raceway, need opinions/advice","Long time lurker, first time poster. Looking for opinions/advice for what I can do.

Car: 2018 BMW F80 M3 Competition 6 speed manual

Info about the engine - Stock, no mods/tunes, only has aftermarket cat-back exhaust and suspension mods  
  
Situation - Was up at Poconos raceway. I was heading down the long straight. In prior sessions I was able to hit 152 mph. Didn't think too much in the last session, going down around 135 mph and wanted to shift to 5th gear. Inside I slammed into 3rd gear. As soon as I did and released the clutch and gave it some gas, I knew I screwed up and threw it out of 3rd and back into 4th. I don't recall hearing any big boom or noise, but I slowed down immediately. No CEL came on immediately but soon (maybe 15 seconds later) it did with the drivetrain malfunction. Before getting back to the pitlane, I saw the rev-limit dropped down to 4k. I limped back to the pit lane to the very start thinking maybe I didn’t mess anything up majorly but stopped and turned off the car. Towards the end of the session, I started the car again, ran a little rough but no major sound and took another lap to get back to the parking lot (yes in hindsight, very stupid idea). When I got to the parking lot and tried to reverse, the engine died. I tried to start but nothing. It will not turn over. There's no engine leak or any visible damage on the outside (e.g. rod going through the engine case).

Here's notes by the tech:

*  got car to start and check engine light on and flashing , tpms light on and flashing , miss fire faults in multiple cylinders , plus fault for cam crank sync on both cam shafts, would have to go further in to testing , but tech suspects a couple of failed injectors along very strong possibility of crank hub spun causing timing issues with engine, after documentation of faults deleted and then restarted and both cam faults reutrned and miss fire cylinder 2 and 3
* Scope/camera found no issues identified.

(I've included a subset of the images sent to me)

When I spoke to the shop, they said the damages were confined to the valves. They recommended replacing all the intake/exhaust valves. All replacement parts will be BMW OEM parts.  They are estimating at around $15k parts and labor, though the shop mentioned they like to run high on estimates and typically go lower. I didn't expect this to be this high but would love to get feedback on this. Also, based on the images, I see the valves made impressions on the pistons, are there any concerns with that kind of contact? (included some of the pictures).

For the F80 M3, the crank hub is a point of weakness so I'll most likely upgrade that to the tune of $2.4k. 

Finally, they recommend replacing the injectors as well \~ $2.2k for parts only. I see Bosch are the same units ([https://f80.bimmerpost.com/forums/sh....php?t=1750797](https://f80.bimmerpost.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1750797)) for much lower pricing, I'll see if they can use these instead. But again, if there's no damage, any reason to update?  
  
All their work includes a 2 year, 24k miles warranty.  
  
Does this sound reasonable or much higher than what others would charge?  
  
And lastly, how much would a F80 M3 with a dead motor fetch?",1,1757258431.0,8,AskMechanics,1757360040,2025-09-07 15:20:31,2025-09-08 19:34:00,"Resident-Gear2309 (Score: 3): Snapped chain? Defo needs a rebuild either way

Emission and it's related sensors won't send your car into limp mode. Emissions uses o2 sensors to read exhaust post catalytic converter. Its only purpose is to report data. Everything else is for engine control management. 

Limp mode is important to help reduce damage to the engine. Most specificly variable timing components. Most variable timing is controlled through oil pressure. If there's a sudden loss or low oil pressure it can damage these components. Limp mode locks out the variable timing and limits the throttle position to keep engine RPM low to prevent major damage but allow you to get the vehicle F o somewhere safe. 

The alternative is your engine may experiences a catastrophic failure instead and you cant move it without a tow truck. So Limp mode is necessary.  I get a bad sensor causing all this trouble is an annoyance but the Limp mode condition is a necessary evil.

2 days ago, the I noticed an unusual vibration (slightly) at a stop light. Then it began stalling when I take my foot off the gas while driving. RPMs would drop way low and it would just die. However, it does NOT stall if I'm idling and when the clutch pedal pressed in when I'm driving. Also, no CEL or warning lights came on.

Later I took it to my local mechanic. He revved it to like 6-7k rpm for a few seconds in idling and took it for a drive. The problem completely disappeared while he had it and even I drove it around with him beside. He said since it was just serviced and he couldn't find anything, it was ""fine."" But I'm not convinced.

This is intermittent and a major safety issue as the steering and brakes lock up when it stalls and engine goes off while driving.

1nakovk,Chasing a tick/clunk. Found a random object and tiny frustrated vent.,"I have been diagnosing a ticky knock for the entire day. I finally found that It is likely the manifold. I should have known better, because I did. It's like the number one most common problem these trucks have. So In this search, I removed the valve covers, and I found a foreign object in the head. A foil seal from some long ago oil bottle. Poor truck. 

Hours later and I'm wondering what, if any, damage this could have caused.

This is a 1995 F250 5.8 (351w) with 224,900 miles.
The debris was found resting in the head directly below the fill neck. It was folded up, and mostly covering the return hole in the front left corner of the head. I am assuming this means it did not pass through the engine. It was full of crud, so oil must have been passing by/through it. 

Could this have caused a significant oil pressure restriction? 

The truck has been ""lovingly kept"" for the last seven years. By that I mean I've put about 40k on it, serviced it far more than needed, and fixed nearly one of its 3/4 tons in the weight of parts alone. My compression numbers are 133-140. The entire valve train is dark bronzed, with a thin, old layer of crud. Pushrods oil perfectly. 60 lbs of oil pressure always. It has always run beyond what I expected at 12 degrees. It's been down on power, louder, and the sound of Rodney getting louder in my head for the last few weeks. It is antagonizing me. I'm sure it's the manifold(s), but what if it's rods. I got this.

The other wire colors should just be matched up and reconnected to their appropriate connector.

You can buy a pack online with wires and get them connected back together.

Look for something like ‘toyota fuel injector pigtail’ and select the plugs that have the latch on the side rather than top. The dealership does sell the terminals with a pre crimped wire pigtail as well - though for like $15 each.

Then crimp or solder the wires together.

Tbh it's my incompetence I didn't investigate the brakes but I just didn't expect it to wear that much, I put a set of new Toyo tires on the front in may (a pothole claimed the first one in 9 days) and the second lasted until last week (pothole again) but it was down to about 3mm in only 2 months of driving so maybe the signs were there

This car munches through tires, brakes and suspension components at a crazy rate, every 2-4 weeks I'm replacing a bushing on the driveway or something 

AutoDoc gave me a refund from the front pair of pads because I left a 2 star review stating the amount of dust they left was crazy (they said it's a warranty issue)

I do drive in a more spirited manner and it's a front heavy barge but costs are adding up quickly

The vast majority of Category U cars on Copart are from vendors who have taken the cars in part exchange. Due to high mileage and/or mechanical/cosmetic issues they do not wish to retail the cars so put them through auction. They are then purchased by other traders who will (hopefully) fix the issues and put them up for sale.

Category U is an informal categorisation and does not have to be disclosed by the vendor, whereas Cat S/N must be disclosed for a retail sale. Many used cars have been through an auction at some point in their lives, it's how most dealers buy stock. However, if you don't feel comfortable buying the car or feel it was misrepresented - for example, if you asked where the car was from and they didn't say it was from an auction - then you should ask for your deposit to be refunded.

1nb6rp0,"Fun, reliable car for around 10k - City driving","Hello!

Im (28m) with a good job and very low expenses, living at home in London.

I'm currently at the end of a lease deal for a 2024 Kia Ceed, which I paid £2.2k upfront and £199 monthly for 2 years (\~ £7.2k cost of leasing) with a yearly mileage allowance of 6k, which over 2 years I only managed to do \~6.3k miles... I do not regret getting this lease at all, it offered me so much freedom to go where I want, when I want, especially whilst still living at home. There are many things I have done, places I have gone, that I wouldn't have if I didn't have a car.

My problem is that I don't use my car a lot at all, as shown by my low mileage after 2 years. I WFH, rarely use my car during the week, and sometimes do on weekend which can often involve driving multiple friends. But it has been highly convenient, knowing I can get in and go at any time. My house is very well connected, with the central line (tube) being a 2 minute walk. It only takes me 20 minutes to get into the city, if that. I do the occasional long trip to Manchester, Bournemouth.. or Croydon.

I decided to lease my first car because it was hassle free. I didn't have to shop for the best used car, and I had little to no maintenance cost. (Replaced 1 tyre due to a puncture and had 1 mandatory service)

Now I don't know what the next best course of action is.

I want a nice looking, reliable car that I enjoy driving... even in London if thats possible, that doesn't cost me that much (whether monthly or due to maintenance)

In terms of body shape I'd ideally like a coupe, saloon or convertible. For example I've been looking at an MX-5 (apparently low maintenance cost and a good drive), GT86, Audi TT, 2 series. Something sporty and fun. Ideally with some form of backseats for the eventual passengers, but it's not mandatory.

My main questions would be;

\* Should I get something even cheaper than £10k, Im talking closer to £5k.

\* What kind of cars should I be looking at considering I live in London and have fairly low usage.

\* Is something like an MX-5 worth having if I live in a city and am usually stuck in 20mph zones.

I'm not a car enthusiast (even though I like F1) and really don't want to go through the process of searching for a car. I also don't want to be dealing with a ton of issues with buying used cars, although I do plan to look after one if I do have it.

tl;dr:

\* Live in London

\* Very low mileage use (previous was 6k miles in 2 years)

\* Petrol (No diesel)

\* Prefer something sporty and fun to drive

\* Reliable and low maintenance

\* \~10k budget",7,1757283867.0,31,CartalkUK,1757360040,2025-09-07 22:24:27,2025-09-08 19:34:00,"stevee05282 (Score: 12): 595 Abarth

Not much other info to go on. Standard AI description. Doesn't say what trim level it is. Service history etc,

I would also really check the service history. They don't even mention it. Beware if they claim FSH as it may have been serviced on mileage and they claim the 3 services it has had over 18 years count or whatever. Time is also a factor with servicing and is important on cars with timing chains There's also a few things on the MOT record that suggest other than loving care. Rolled over advisory etc. But as you say nothing too serious. I assume it's on the ditchiest of ditchfinder tyres. 

Also you say ""official dealer"". It is. For Fiats. For safety I'd assume this is a trade-in they slapped a new MOT on with a friendly MOT place. So make sure to thoroughly inspect.

We are now 6 months down the line and the dealership managers last response after my complaint was the original offer of £500, and that it was his understanding that I had ignored one of their emails (which I hadn’t, sent proof of this and pointed out they didn’t reply). I turned this down as firstly the remainder of the quote was actually £600 to be paid by me. But also based on the miles I had done in the car since buying, on average I would have been able to do these all on the battery. Meaning I would have been able to save £500 on petrol if I had the EV tariff with a home charger. But also the terrible service I experienced, I logged 4 if not 5 official complaints.

I had just purchased a new house and had a baby since getting the car, I don’t want to have to pay another £600 for something that isn’t my fault. I stated in my initial complaint that if it couldn’t be resolved I’d like to return the car as it was only 6 days after purchase.

1navhqb,About to pull the trigger on a 2014 Honda CR-V — what should I look out for?,"After weeks of searching for a car for my wife, we think we’ve settled on a Honda CR-V. We've also looked at Rav 4s, Kia Sportages, Hyundai Tucsons, Octavia Estates, and a Jeep Cherokee. The Cherokee was really nice but its patchy history made us walk away. For reference we have a budget of £6000 and the car must be clean air zone friendly.

The CR-V we’ve found is a **2014 2.0 petrol (ULEZ compliant)** with some nice extras like leather seats and a panoramic roof. It’s had just one owner, has a decent service history, and on paper seems to tick all the boxes.

The only catch is it’s 120 miles away, so we can’t just pop over for a look. The seller’s provided videos and plenty of photos, but before we make the journey (or risk buying it unseen), I’d love some input.

* Are there any common issues with this engine/year I should be aware of?
* Known weak spots or expensive repairs to check for?
* Anything specific on CR-Vs of this era that often gets overlooked?

Would value any input anyone can offer.

Most of the scratches looked like they could be polished out, so I wasn’t too bothered about those. But that scuff on the bumper really put me off, especially since I’d asked about things like that beforehand. There were clear signs of smart repair which was not done properly.

When I pointed it out, the trader said he hadn’t even noticed. The car had been through a quick valet and he told me it was “ready for sale” and that plenty of buyers (9/10) wouldn’t mind it as it is and that this expected for a car of this age and mileage (60k).

Long story short, I’m interested in buying either an X5, RR sport or a defender.

I found a local dealer who had all three in stock, and since I had never driven any of those cars before I asked if I could test drive them all. 

Immediately he thought I was a tyre kicker just wanting to try out a few nice cars. Started saying “you can’t just come here to take my stock out for a joyride” and said “a real buyer knows what they want and would buy the car they want”.

Genuinely, I love the look of all the cars and wanted to see which one would fit me best (I’m 6’5), and what the power delivery was like.

I’m not joking when I say this has happened to me twice now. 

How am I supposed to make a decision on what best suits me if nobody will even let me test drive anything 🤣

Any dealers on here got any insight? Any tips to not piss if dealers?

1napi9k,"My first Automatic, is it me, or is the car faulty? Cupra 290.","Hello all,

  
I did post this in r/seat, but I thought I might get something here as well, with there being a lot of mechanics here.



I recently purchased a used Seat Leon Cupra 290, 55.8K miles on the clock, DSG auto, 2019 reg. I'm unsure if I don't know how to drive an auto (my first), or if something is genuinely wrong with the car...



The first thing I'm finding, is no matter how long the car has been sat, 12mins or 12hrs, it idles at 1500RPM for a good 1-2mins.



The second issue I'm finding, is when I'm breaking/slowing down for a corner or roundabout, it will not change down the gears as I think it should. I can be slowed right down to 10-12mph and it's stuck in 3rd gear, but the car looses all power when it's in that state. The only way I can get power back is by getting the revs up beyond 2000rpm or bringing the speed up to match the gear it has selected. Which is difficult when I'm making the manoeuvre so I usually just stop the car completely, yesterday was the worst so far, 13mph but still in 4th gear.



Among all of the gear issues, I'm also experiencing the sensation of resistance, as if when I'm slowing, the car is fighting me, almost like lifting the clutch up on a manual in 4th when you're doing 60mph, if that makes sense.



The third issue I'm finding, is with the paddle shifts, my thought was, the answer to all my problems is just use the manual features. But the paddle shifts will not change gears when the car is in the state explained above, it won't shift up even though it's at 2500RPM, it won't shift down when stuck in 3rd. They do however work when the car is acting as I would expect.



My fourth and final issue I'm having, is that I'm only getting 12-16MPG. I understand the car has almost 290bhp but I'm not ragging it about in the slightest. I've owned the car for 22 days as of today, and I've filled up from a quarter tank, 5 times. I just can not get the range up to the 35-39MPG advertised.

Can't go wrong with those axle stands can you? Any other brands or designs to consider? Don't mind paying a bit more if they're inherently more safer. Don't think I'll need the 3T ones as I'm not working on anything heavier than a typical hatchback. 

Anyone have the above tools and can recommend what to or not to get?

I went with the 'magic' axel stands but in hindsight I don't like this feature and should have got the regular ones.

Note you need to buy some rubber grooved pads for the top of the stands if you plan to use them under sills. (<10£ on ebay). And the jack comes with two pads, so you don't need to buy extras.

I think the ones you plan to buy, like mine, will be excellent value. But personally, for the extra not much money I'd get the 3 tonne stuff. Don't fuck around with safety.

OolonCaluphid (Score: 2): The ratchet stands imo are inherently more dangerous than the more basic pin design. There were harbor freight ratchet models failing a while back. 

I've always made do with cheaper trolley jacks. My first one was £40 from Halfords and has lasted 20 years and still works well. I just got a low lift one again for £40 and it's good. I do t see the need to spend more for a home gamer. 

I've done multiple full suspension rebuilds and brake work etc with them over the years.

Specimen_E-351 (Score: 2): I keep getting told I'm unlucky but I had one of the fancy aluminium sgs jacks fail just out of warranty.

I have a Bradbury one from the 60s that I bought second hand that will still lift things up after whatever world conflict triggers a full scale nuclear exchange."

1naf4ww,Does an OBD2 scanner show historic problems? And is a faulty injector big enough cause to reject a car within 1 month?,"Bought a used A3 and EML came on shortly afterwards ( a week later). Brought it back to dealer who plugged in his scanner and said passive fault with one of the injectors, which is probably due to moisture as the car had been sitting for a while.

Whilst he didn't say he wouldn't replace he did say that the warranty didn't cover first 28 days. He did replace a dip beam bulb though without issue!! He turned off the light and said if it comes back on bring it back to him.

My question is if I got my own scanner would it show up historic issues related to the injectors? If it did then I would be able to show that the fault was there when I purchased it.

Any advice appreciated!",0,1757204370.0,10,CartalkUK,1757360040,2025-09-07 00:19:30,2025-09-08 19:34:00,"DaughterOfATiredMech (Score: 2): I think it depends on your scanner. Don’t quote me, I have not scanner my car in a long time. But I believe my scanner had a stored DTC and a Cleared DTC. 

So technically you can see something that was cleared but I’m not sure if it’s only after an ignition cycle or how long 

segafodder (Score: 2): Warranty may not cover the first 28 days but your consumer rights do. Give them one chance to fix it, if they refuse or fail to then reject the car.

Chris_the_dood (Score: 1): Unfortunately there's no way to see historic codes once they've been cleared.

What the dealer has said re the cer being sat for a while sounds perfectly sensible.

That said, I'd try to get something in writing to say if the same code reappears over the next few months they will fix it for you."
