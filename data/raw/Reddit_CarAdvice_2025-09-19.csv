But if you're wondering if Nissans have had a lot of recall and maintenance issues. The answer is oh yeah. They're the Chrysler of Japan.

Nissan used to be great, but around the turn of the millennium their quality took a nose dive off of a cliff and has only got worse over time. Personally, I wouldn't own Nissan anything unless the model year began in 19. They actually used to be really good in the 90s and prior. I had a 90s Maxima and that car was sweeeeeet.

That said. I bet this issue is easily resolved by a skilled mechanic. Sounds like a pesky sensor or switch.

I went to a hyundai dealership to try to get my trunk fixed and a tire replaced. I went on the 6th and they gave me a quote but I said nah just do the tire since the trunk would be 1400 and I don't need it that bad tbh (it's stuck shut). They ordered the tire/smth else and said to come back in a week but then on the 10th it died out of nowhere. I got it jumped, drove around and then it was fine.

I mentioned that it died when I brought it to them on the 13th and he said they took a brief look but didnt see anything wrong with it when they replaced the tire. Then later that night I got back from a concert and my car died for like 10 seconds... I stopped the car then all my lights turned off instead of waiting till I lock it and walk away like it usually does. I tried to start it and it took like 3 seconds. Then it started fine, but the clock was reset again. 

  
Fast forward to yesterday (the 17th). It was fine, i drove to walmart, got some groceries, and then it died while I was in the parking lot. It always starts up after a jump but im confused why it's doing this. My car died back in february when it was brutally cold and I completely replaced the battery then... so this new battery should be fine (also got that from the dealership).

Today (the 18th), I sat down in my car after work and found this yellow thing in my car seat. I'm wondering if the battery isn't even dead but theres just a loose connection or something. I dunno its annoying af.

You do know that simply swapping in an unknown part will very likely make it very difficult to handle as it will mess up many of the suspension angles needed for stability. You need not just the upper and lower ball joint mounts but the distance to the tire rods and any angle between the tie rods and the plane of the rotors. Then you want the distance from the ball joint mounts to the hub centerline and the rotor. That way you can draw out plans for the steering and suspension arcs to get the Ackerman geometry correct and be able to steer.

If you put coil overs on a car with non adjustable camber then having excessive negative camber would be something you would experience.

waynep712222 (Score: 2): what brand of brake vacuum booster pump do you have.. make and model.. 

 almost all NON DIESEL app brake booster vacuum pumps.. are installed with 2 hoses. one a PCV hose so it does not collapse between the pump creating vacuum and the booster check valve.. 

 but most also have a second PCV hose..  that goes from the vacuum pump outlet to the intake manifold.. 

 so the booster pump only has to increase the vacuum 5 or 6 inches. so from 10 inches of manifold vacuum on some engines to boost the vacuum assist in the booster over 16 inches.. 

 many people with GM Cars and trucks have seen the odd back fuel filter in the power brake booster hose. that is a Carbon canister that prevents fuel vapors from the intake manifold from getting in and dissolving the rubber diaphragm and the power brake booster valve seals and rings. 

 most autoparts stores and tool stores sell these.. https://www.harborfreight.com/fuel-pump-and-vacuum-tester-62637.html

  aftermarket vacuum pumps should hold vacuum after shut down for at least 10 seconds in the hose to the power brake booster.. 

  testing the power brake booster..  warm engine up.. if connected to the manifold vacuum.. step on the brake pedal.. hold 70 to 100 pounds of pressure on the brake pedal.. shut engine off as you start counting.. how long till the brake booster vacuum is lost and the pedal starts pushing upwards slightly..  less than 5 seconds is bad..

  since you have an electric booster pump.. 

 what kind of vacuum hose are you running from the booster pump to the. check valve on the booster.. 

 PCV Hose at autozone. in bulk by the foot behind the counter is SKU number 50290 for 11/32 PCV hose.. 50291 is 15/32 which is never used on domestic cars i have seen , 50292 is 19/32  .. the 3 sizes can be used a lot on German cars to replace the cracked Nylon brake booster vacuum tubing.. FYI..

  its really hard to diagnose a brake booster other than what i said about holding the pedal as you turn off the engine or vacuum pump and doing the  count down.. 

 the big issue for you is.. does any power brake booster rebuilder have the new components for that booster..  its very likely that just buying a new brake booster that shape will solve your issue..

 look thru the PirateJack website.  i don't know but i bet this is the same as yours.. https://piratejack.net/universal-8-dual-diaphragm-chrome-booster/

The catalyst code is common with faulty O2 sensors, easily replaceable though they can be an absolute nightmare to break loose. It could also be a genuine problem with your system running too rich. Cheapest place to start is air filter."

1nkgf4q,Wheel came off car while driving on highway - trying to understand what happened?,"2011 Honda CRV AWD with 2.4 L engine

I was driving on the highway and the right side of the car drops, I look right, and I see my wheel bouncing/flying off into the distance. I'm trying to understand mechanically how this could've happened? It looks like one of the bolts completely sheared off, two bolts are missing, and two are missing lug nuts at the end? Picture below

My searching so far suggests that over or under torquing the wheels when they were installed could potentially explain it. The front tires were last taken off about 3 months and 5000 miles of driving ago to install new front lower control arms. I'm not sure if this is too long ago or too much driving has occurred to say that these are related issues.

I'm happy to post this instead to r/TireQuestions if that's a better fit.

1nkg6dp,Need help with oil pressure light,"Pic mostly for attention

My 2016 dodge dart has been sitting for a couple years, not running. Last time I tried driving it (2 years ago) the oil pressure light came on, I tried changing the oil and filter and it‚Äôs still on. 

Fast forward to now, i replaced the oil pressure sensor, but i was scared to tighten it too much. The car seemed fine, took it around the corner, still fine, went to autozone a few miles away, it came back on when i was waiting at a stop sign, but when i drive again it turns off. 

I‚Äôve noticed if i keep the car moving, the oil light stays off. When im waiting at a red light, it comes back on. 

I know there‚Äôs multiple reasons this light can come on but I‚Äôm wondering if it could be old oil and oil filter since I just replaced the oil pressure sensor unless I didn‚Äôt tighten it enough or since I didn‚Äôt spray electronic cleaner on the plug since the old one was leaking. 

If I remember correctly after I did that oil change the car hasn‚Äôt really gone more than 15 feet from the street to my driveway and sat for 2 years, could the oil and oil filter degrade from the car sitting for that long and cause the oil light to come on? I know it‚Äôs cheap to just replace it and the filter but I‚Äôve already spent over $600 on fuel pump (it was bad) and other things to get this thing moving again, if the oil and filter are fine I would rather not spend more money to change those. I‚Äôve tried looking it up and get conflicting answers of yes change both every 12 months or that modern oils and filters are good in the sense they don‚Äôt break down easily.",1,1758219957.0,14,MechanicAdvice,1758310361,2025-09-18 18:25:57,2025-09-19 19:32:41,"LackingStability (Score: 3): That's a tyre pressure warning.

1nkfmhi,Spongey brakes still after work,"I have a 2010 Mazda 3 2.5 L

 My brakes started being spongy intermittently and then consistently, so I took it to the shop. First, they replaced the master cylinder and the front left caliper and hose, and cleaned the emergency brake line claiming it was rusty.

 On my way to/from work, the brakes felt a bit better in the sense that when almost fully engaged, like 75% of the pedal, it would come to a dead halt, but it took much more of the pedal to get there than before. 

 When I got home I noticed the rear left brake was emitting a strong smell and was very hot, so I checked the emergency brake and there was barely any resistance when I tried to activate it, and the car still rolled some, so I took it back in.

 Turns out the emergency brake was locked (wasn't happening before). They replaced the rear calipers and brake pads and changed out the master cylinder with another new one in case the first one was faulty.

 The brakes still take almost halfway down on the pedal to really get stopping power, but they feel solid once they get there. They still don't feel like they did before the issue began, where it only took about 25% of the pedal to get stopping power.

I guess my question is, could this be the way they are intended to feel, and my old calipers were responsible for the brakes engaging so quickly?

Or do I need a new mechanic?

1nkcdke,Rocker arms? Valve Lifters? Help needed!,"Good afternoon,

This is my first post here so forgive me if it is a little bit clumsy and not formatted correctly.

I‚Äôve had my car for roughly 3 years now and 50k-ish miles. Honestly I was a neglectful owner in the first few months (up until I did my first oil change). Ever since I‚Äôve been babying this car (in terms of maintenance), spark plugs, oil changes, brakes, all fluids (coolant, brake, steering, etc).

I noticed this noise ever since a few months into ownership that sounds like a rattling / fluttering noise from the RPM range of 1400~ to 2400~. The noise does increase in rate with acceleration, no change in volume or intensity just a faster rate. Car has not thrown any codes related to the matter nor lacked / slouched in performance. After doing some digging I believe it to be a Valve Lifter or a Rocker Arm on the driver side bank. I plan on replacing both but I wanted to seek advice.

I saw that it was definitely possible to replace the rocker arm and lifters without removing the cams using a flathead as leverage to coerce it out. I feel pretty comfortable digging into the top end of the motor and completely understand jobs like this takes double what‚Äôs expected, however if I can get any insight or advice from professional mechanics from this Subreddit I would appreciate all insight.

That resistor doesn't look damaged to me, anyway, but unless you're good at SMD (surface mounted device) soldering, you'll have to get a new ECU or find someone who can repair that one.

EDIT: If the ECU were ""blown"" by an event, there's be more wrong than a voltage for a sensor.  It's possible the same voltage source powers many sensors, so your MAP sensor problem could be wiring, or it could be a bad MAP sensor.

Checked the coolant, it was a little below min already, so I put more in.
Next day I start it up, smoke rolls out of the exhaust, white and smells like coolant. After 60 to 90 seconds the smoke stops. I drive to work and it rides fine. 8 hours later I start it and no smoke whatsoever. 
My question is why would this not happen every single time its running? Im not a car guy unfortunately so Im lost here.

1nk8swn,2013 Volvo C30 T5 struggling to start,"Howdy all, I'm hoping you guys have some insight

Vehicle: 2013 Volvo C30 T5 5 speed automatic 213k miles

When I try to start the car the starter gives a kind of half crank and then stops. Imagine blipping the starter. I turn the key, hold it in the start position, the starter does the half crank and stops. It takes a few tries to get the engine to turn over, but it's intermittent, sometimes the issue doesn't occur and the car fires up first time, and other times it takes five attempts to get the thing started. 

I'm not sure if it's related but sometimes it cranks probably 2-3x as long as normal before engine start. (The cranking time is automatic afaik) 

Once the engine is running I have no problems, it performs fine under load with no vibration, noises, or loss of power, so i think this issue is confined to starting.

Normal operation has me turn the key to the start position and release it, the car cranks and starts in probably 2-3 seconds. It's always been very responsive

Battery voltage with the engine off is ~12V and ~14V with the engine running, so I don't think it's a power supply issue. My original starter just died (maybe related, but as far as I know it's factory original) so I replaced the starter and the issue persists, so it isn't an issue with the motor itself.

I'm at work at the moment I'll see if I can get a video of the behavior over lunch

Thank you for your consideration, I'd really appreciate any advice!

Either something has died in the emissions system or your turbo has failed, or you've blown a headgasket. (Or, if your car uses an intercooler with low tempature coolant in it, that could've failed and is dumping coolant directly into the intake, that could cause it to hydrolock and bend the connecting rods) or the PCV is letting the engine pull oil directly out of the crankcase.


If you're burning enough oil to make that big of a cloud, you are at risk of a diesel runaway event, which is where the engine starts to run on its own oil, then the increasing RPMs push/pull more oil in, causing it to run faster, until it reaches many times its maximum rated RPM, and it comes apart violently.

1nkkbsq,Nissan Altima 2017 rough idle/check engine light,"
So this morning entering the highway, my engine started misfiring. I instantly thought it was a spark plug or coil and went to have it checked out at a local shop by my work. They hooked up the scanner and listened to the rough idle stated that it‚Äôs the spark plugs and coils, and that something fuel related needs to be cleaned out. He verbally told me around $280+ at 2.5 hours of labor, And that the plugs need to be iridium.  I asked for a write up on how much it would cost to change that out with labor and parts and I was told ‚Äúno I can‚Äôt do that because I would have to charge you a diagnostic fee and then I could do that for you‚Äù basically implying that he‚Äôs helping me out, idk how I felt about that, but I moved on from that and just wanted more info. The job hasn‚Äôt been done yet. 

Later today after work I decided to buy some spark plugs and switch them out. While removing one plug from the well I noticed oil inside. I removed any excess oil and installed 4 spark plugs and replaced 1 damaged coil that disassembled itself, the one that was in the oil. Okay now I started the car and nothing changed. Except some heavy white smoke from the exhaust pipes for like 1-2 minutes then it cleared up, Still a rough idle but I was reaching speeds of 60+ mph this morning and later this afternoon even after switching out the plugs. I have a feeling a gasket is cracked or whateva, but I‚Äôm no mechanic and have exhausted my options and feel like I‚Äôm about to lose my car. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm capable of switching out something like internals.

That being said let's start with the easy stuff and go from there:

Is your oil at the proper level? Coolant full?(Low coolant could be a sign of a bad head gasket, which can cause misfires)

If it's just misfiring, I'd check wiring, make sure the coils and injectors are getting voltage and ground (easy enough with a test light if the injectors aren't a giant pain to get to) also signal to the coils.

If everything checks out there my next step would be to check compression.

If it has proper spark, air, fuel, and compression it could be a timing issue, google says stretched chains and bad tensioners are common on the 3.0

1nkjilq,1997 car- please help,"Hello, Reddit mechanic experts! I purchased a 1997 Nissan Maxima SE a couple weeks ago. The car is HEAVILY modified, and it looks like the previous owner did most of the work himself. It has a 2006 VQ35 (3.5 liter) Maxima engine swap in it (built), a 5 speed manual swap, suspension, exhaust, etc.

I took it to a local auto performance shop to go over what needs done, and they came up with the following list. I am not savvy enough to know exactly how important each item is with regards to A. Truly needing to be done IMMEDIATELY B. Needing to be done within the next year or so or C. not really necessary.

Keep in mind this is NOT my daily driver. I only intend to drive the Max 1-2 times per week locally, maybe 50 miles a week or so, as a ""weekend fun"" car. I also do not intend or need the car to last me 5 or 10 more years. I will likely sell it or trade for something else within 2-3 years.

With this in mind, could you guys rank order the importance of the following items the shop says need fixing:

1. Rear caliper has a broken bolt
2. Alternator is fluctuating between 14 and 15.2 volts (bouncing)
3. Engine swap wiring has been poorly done
4. Steering rack bushings are very worn
5. Front sway bar bushings are worn

Dawg you should NEVER see the fibers in a tire. And you should be replacing tires long before they go slick. Follow the rubber indicators on the tire tread to know how long each one has until it's time to be replaced.

KeepItUpThen (Score: 1): A lot of modern cars use the fuel level sensor plus the ECU's calculated fuel consumption to estimate how much fuel has been drained from the tank. Especially for cars with 'saddle' shaped fuel tanks or two fuel tanks that are hard to measure, the car might be relying pretty heavily on the ECU fuel consumption estimate when the fuel level is below 50%. You can test this by adding a small amount of fuel when the tank is nearly empty, the sensor might not measure the change for some cars.
  
Older cars with analog gauges use a very slow smoothing filter. The gas gauge of a car from the late 1990s might take an extra 30-60 seconds to show full after refilling the tank. Adding fuel to the tank is the quickest change in fuel level that can be expected, the engine doesn't use fuel nearly as quickly. So it was considered acceptable if the smoothing was a little slower than the process of refueling. The needle moves very slowly to avoid the needle bouncing.

I tried jumping it and it still wouldn't start. All of the lights on the dash and other electrical elements were functioning normally during all of this. When I tried to start the car, I would hear one click but the engine wouldn't turn over.

I took the battery to Autozone to be sure it wasn't the battery. They said it was a good battery when they tested it. I then removed the starter and bench tested it in my garage. The solenoid was functioning and the gear was spinning. I took it to Autozone to have them test it for extra reassurance and it passed their bench test.

I put the same starter back in. The first attempt to restart the car, it did the same thing - 1 click but no start. I tried it again and it started right up. I tried it several more times and the car is now consistently starting without issue.

I'm wondering if maybe the starter is actually on the border of failing despite the fact it's starting up now. Should I be worried about that?

Never had any issues out of it, few month ago did have new spark plugs put in. 

She decided to trade it in and got an internet offer of $7,800 for it, given it was in good condition and running fine, as it always has been. 

Our luck on her way to do the trade it lost power, would not go over 25mph then made some heavy shakes and clanks and died. I through it on trailer and brought it back to house. 

It was showing code: 
P052A ( Cold Start A Camshaft Position Timing Over - Advanced Bank ) 

& 

P1326 Definition not found. 

I checked the oil and it was perfectly fine, normal levels and no leaks. 

Google & Chat GPT ( I‚Äôm not a mechanic, but also grew up farming on fairly large farms so I know how to use tools but I am far from an expert by any means ) 

Told me to replace the Camshaft Sensor & Starter motor. 

I ordered new Camshaft Sensor & Starter Motor and replaced them myself. 

Car is not throwing codes anymore, that cleared them but I‚Äôm just getting a click from the solenoid no turn over. ( Battery is Charged, 12.9V and no other shorts anywhere) 

So naturally I tried to turn the crankshaft manually, Frozen stiff. I could not turn it at all. 

So then I took the spark plugs outs ( everything was fine with no fluid build up ) and tried to turn the crankshaft again. Would not move a mm. Frozen solid. 

So then I took the belt off and tried. Frozen solid still. 

So I took the valve cover off, everything looks fine. Chain is fine, well lubricated, valves looked fine, cam caps looked fine. 

So off to the bottom of the car I went, dropped the oil pan. 

Everything to me looks perfect fine and normal. 

No visible broken rods or anything out of ordinary. 

I took off the rod caps on #2, #3, everything looked fine, shiny silver with some oil lubrication and can push the piston up and down. No visible scoring or issues with those two journals. 

Tried to turn crankshaft again. Frozen stiff.

I can‚Äôt get the rod caps off #1 or #4 because I can‚Äôt access the bolts, there blocked ( even with a low profile socket, and wobble I simply can only get to one bolt on each. 

At this point I‚Äôm at a complete loss and confused on what the hell happened and what to do next. 

The dealer said there offer still stands if I can drive it there for the $7,800. If I have to tow it there then it‚Äôs reduced to only $500. 

Any advice?

Had code p0101

-New Air Filter 
-Replaced Engine Intake Manifold Runner Control Valve/Solenoid (for a different code I can't recall, it never returned)
-New MAF, the good kind.

A month later P0101 returned with a P0172 code 

It was driving okay but took it to a local mechanic as I needed to pass emissions.

-Smoke Test passed
-Throttle body cleaned

Made it just in time for inspection and then light came back on same codes

A a week later it stalled.

Reputable local mechanic couldn't figure it out.

Went to dealership
-cleaned MAF as there was debris.  

Picked it up drove about 10 miles. Idled rough, it stalled again. 

Back to dealership: they drive it 50 miles said they couldn't duplicate.

Picked it up drove it 100 miles, stalled.

Tried a different good local mechanic, they can't figure it out.

Back to dealership, there best tech according to the advisor.

-Recalibrated PCM
-Cleaned intake valve
-Idle relearned.

Picked it up took it for an oil change, drove it about 250 miles, stalled. 

Same codes.

So altogether it's been to 3 shops 6 different times, including the dealership now for the 4th time. 

I know p0172 is a code that can be caused by a number of reasons but I'm feeling frustrated at this point and wonder what I can do on my own. I did mention it could possibly be the purge valve cannister as p0172 didn't show up until after I replaced the IMRC Valve/Solenoid but I don't think I was heard and also I'm not the pro.

The fees have been fairish but even with that I can't keep dealing with the stress of being stranded at any given time.

1nkker6,"A/C intermittently stops blowing cold air, how to fix it? (2010 Nissan Altima 2.5SL)","My beloved black (yes my paint and clear coat are not doing well) 2010 Nissan Altima's a/c is doing something a bit strange. Here are the details:

1. Couple weeks ago I drove to work, business as usual. Went on my lunch break & a/c was working just fine. Got in to leave and it would not blow cold - I turned it on and off, tried different speed and vent settings, raised temp to 90 and lowered back down to 60 after about 30 seconds, tried turning dual mode off to see if that was the problem, nothing. Air flow is fine, just won't blow cold.
2. I know I have a leak, where that leak is I have no idea. Either way I know it's there, I have it recharged every year or two. I had my boyfriend go ahead and check the levels or whatever it's called (he recharged it back in June, put a whole 12 ounce can in) while the a/c was off and while it was running. He says while it's off the gauge is at 0 (? bear with me I'm just a girl) but when I turned the a/c on the gauge maxed out. He told me to leave it off until I could take it to the mechanic and...captured some of the freon that was in there, just in case it was actually overcharged.
3. Left a/c completely off for about a week until I could get diagnostics ran. Told them what I've told you, the office girl was deadset on my compressor being the issue, but the mechanic said nothing came up on diagnostics. Then he came back about 15 minutes later and told me it was blowing cold again. He didn't speak very good English but said he let it run a bit longer, put the rest of the 12 ounce can I had in my floorboard (yeah I know) in and the *condenser* fan started spinning again, so it was not my compressor being seized up or anything like that. Anyways, that was on September 4th.
4. Since then I believe it has stopped working randomly once or twice and then resumed the next time I started my car, but that does bring us to today. Today it was a similar story, was fine at work and on lunch, then I got in at last break to run to the convenience store and it was not blowing cold. I figured it would probably start blowing cold again when I got in to leave, and of course it's never that simple so here I am.

A couple of other tidbits that could or could not be helpful:

* Battery was replaced in December of 2020, I have since then put about 80k-90k miles on this car.
* Back in April of 2021 before I found out I had a leak my a/c would blow cold for about the first 30 minutes to an hour of my drive and gradually stop blowing cold, and I swear it would spit droplets of cold water out of my vents. It eventually stopped blowing cold at all so my dad recharged it and that's how we found out about the leak, it has not done this since.
* **(I wouldn't bother reading this unless you're curious because I genuinely don't think it really has anything to do with the a/c issue.)** This car does have a sunroof, said sunroof has/had clogged drain plugs for a while. It rained a couple times and the water did soak through my headliner at the corners where the cloth meets the plastic. After this happened the temperature gauge on my gauge cluster would sometimes work and sometimes not work, this was about 2 years ago. Since then my entire gauge cluster has been dying, sometimes my RPM gauge doesn't work, sometimes my speedometer doesn't work, sometimes my temperature gauge doesn't work. Sometimes all three don't work at the same time and I have to use a speedometer app I have installed on my phone. Gas gauge works fine though! (Speedometer will usually work again only after coming to a complete stop, the needle seems like it's caught on something, Idk hard to explain.) I have also noticed that depending on how long I hold the brake while turning the car on the better the chance of the gauges working, but it could not be related at all I have no idea. Oh also my a/c speed knob thing is messed up, sometimes when you try to turn it up it turns down, sometimes it skips two speeds, I don't know anymore man it just isn't right :(",3,1758229641.0,3,AskMechanics,1758310361,2025-09-18 21:07:21,2025-09-19 19:32:41,FunHoliday1443 (Score: 1): Not 100% sure but most mechanics won't hook there AC system up to a car that's been topped up with a store bought can due to contamination and mixing AC refrigerants in my experience best bet have the car scanned with a scanner that can read AC related codes also some refrigerants can only be handled by someone who is qualified and putting the wrong AC in can mess up the pump and cause a variety of issues here in Canada purposly releasing AC refrigerants will land you a hefty fine with the EPA tens of thousands of dollars for individuals and hundreds of thousands for corporations there was a company who got a 250000fine for venting a couple years ago best bet bring it to a mechanic and be honest as a mechanic is gonna be allot more pissed if they Evac the system and it screws there machine or ruins all the refrigerant in there system and your on the hook I really don't know and it may be different where you live
1nkkd19,Stuck CV Axle in 2007 Pontiac G6 GT‚Äîany advice?,"Hello, I have been trying to replace the drivers side CV axle on my 2007 Pontiac G6 GT. I am attempting to replace the axle because I noticed the rubber boot on the wheel side had split and was slinging black grease all inside the wheel well and on the backside of the hub. My wife and I just moved to a new city after grad school in July, and I begin a new job an hour away on Monday, so money has been tight and I thought I could replace the axle myself because my dad and I did it on the passenger side in 2021 with relative ease. 

All the YouTube tutorials make it seem rather easy‚Äîat least, that the axle should pop out of the transmission with a pry bar and hammer. I have been trying to pry this axle out for the last 7 hours and am at my wits end. I have used a pry bar and hammer, a pry bar on one side and another pry bar on the other side, I rented the slide hammer/axle adapter, I put the car in neutral and spun the axle about 30 times trying to position the c-clip at 12:00‚Ä¶none of these things have worked. 

The axle adapter that I rented can‚Äôt even fit behind the axle because of how little space is available. As you can see in the pictures, the axle joint is inaccessible from below due to the frame of the car; it is not able to be hit from the back with a hammer and chisel because the transmission is totally in the way; it is not able to be pried much from the left side because the transmission juts out there. The only side where the axle joint is somewhat accessible is the right side, but even then, the adapter will not fit behind it. While under the car, I noticed that where the passenger CV axle (which I have replaced before) enters the transmission is shaped totally different and can easily be pried or chiseled from behind or below.

Does anyone have advice at this point? The joint moves back and forward about 1/8 inch, which I presume is the c-clip catching inside its groove. I have seen people make homemade tools on YouTube, but I am hesitant to invest more time and money when I barely have clearance to fit any tools around the joint to begin with. 

My last resort is to just attempt to repair the tear in the rubber boot, reattach the boot on the transmission side, and drive to a shop to have them remove and replace the axle instead. Alternatively, the car leaks oil, transmission fluid, coolant, leaks water inside the cabin, no longer converts despite being a convertible due to hydraulic problems, and the gearbox has been clicking when I put it in park recently‚Ä¶despite all my best efforts to keep this car running through my broke grad school years, it might just be time to trade/sell it and get as cheap and reliable seeming of a Honda or Toyota I can find.

Thank you in advance for your advice!

b - spend anything upto an hour on the phone waiting for 'authorisation' 

c - strip down the car for nothing

d - build it back up for nothing

In some cases they operate differently in that we do all the diagnosis and then the owner does the legwork BUT that means their car is sitting ""in bits"" for a day-or-3 until that happens - the warranty will NOT pay for work which happens before they say ""OK"" even if they say ""OK""

This is a permanent code meaning once triggered it remains in the cars computer so it should have been seen in a pre purchase inspection if it was active at the time. If it wasn't there it's just bad luck that it came on after you bought it.

It doesn't sound like the mechanic has actually done any diagnostic work and is just throwing everything plus the kitchen sink at it. Imo that's dum AF and is going to be the most expensive option. Most likely one cat or one O2 sensor has died and the rest of the exhaust is fine. There's no need to do all this work if it's just a sensor. 

If it turns out to be one of the cats they can be very expensive, usually you can find aftermarket ones for much cheaper and that could be an option you could ask about if you don't plan on keeping the vehicle long term.

The AMP meter must be connected in series with the battery cable and battery terminal. With all accessories turned off and the car doors closed, record the total maximum current draw measurement. From there, you have to remove one fuse at a time from the fuse box and measure again. Keep doing this until you find the circuit that is causing the most current drain. Then check what that specific circuit is powering and trace it down to the individual component causing the parasitic battery drain. As I said, this can take some time but it can be done with a lot of due diligence and patience.

Most, but not all the exterior rubber seals, the thin solid ones that run along the top of the doors, and the rear quarter windows, that fit between the window and bodywork have shrunk, lost suppleness.

Researching online, I see conflicting ways of how to treat and restore these. Some I believe only restore the colour to the rubbers. And methods to unshrink them, are only temporary in nature, with the rubbers soon to shrink not long after.

I've tried the Jenolite plastic and rubber conditioner, but has had zero effect, which to be honest I expected.

My car is quite loud on the motorway, to the extent that you‚Äôd need to really raise your voice to have a conversation with the person on the passenger seat.

I‚Äôve done some research and I‚Äôm inclined to believe that my tyres might be a big contributing factor to this problem.

*2. Better quality tyres

*3. Higher profile

I've switched from RFTs to none RFTs a few times, but nothing has dampened road noise as much as a full suspension refresh.

This is how both  front tyres look like. middle of tyre is still fine, and still some 2 mm left to the mark.  
wheels misalign quite often (aligning been done many times over the 10 years I had it), no idea why, and thread is being ripped off on the outsides of both tyres. Had these tyres for 2 years and about 18k miles. Should I replace these or can I keep using them?

On the point about it being cheaper than a used car, that isn't necessarily true. In fact, car dealers love to point to the lower monthly price on a new car to hook you on a finance deal.¬†

The APR of a new car is less consequential than the overall depreciation. I've financed new cars at 0% APR but still ended up in negative equity thanks to depreciation. But crucially, the new car will still have a much bigger final (balloon payment) at the end of the finance term. This isn't an issue if you plan to return it but this is also how car dealers keep people hooked on new cars. You may not be able to make the final payment but you'll still likely need a car. At the end of the term they just dangle a new attractive monthly rate on a new car in front of you and you end up never having any equity in a vehicle.¬†

If you look at a used car, the finance might be say 8%. But chances are it's seen its steepest depreciation. Also as you're starting from a lower price, the final payment will also be less. This is a better option if you say wanted to pay a manageable figure now and then own the car eventually.¬†

Going with the new car is a much better way to have a manageable monthly cost. It's the worst way to own a car though if you plan on making the final payment. You're always better off letting someone else own the first 3 years of depreciation which are the steepest.

This was fixed by the dealer and since has a completely clear MOT without any advisories. During the first week of driving I noticed a squealing noise from the brakes so got them checked. The mechanic said the brakes are fine but there is significant rust to the underneath of the car. He said the car looks 20 years old rather than 10 years old. He said this could be due to the car being kept near the sea. He said i can expect significant expensive repairs in the coming years and said I should consider selling immediately. I should have been more thorough and got a mechanic to look at the car before buying. I invested a bit more than I usually would in this car because I wanted something reliable and that would last me years. I tried to return to dealer but, I think correctly, none of the consumers act law apply to my situation.

1nk6xvh,Help on buying a new car,"Hello üëã 

Hoping people can help me on getting this new car I've ordered, I'm trying to avoid being ripped off by salesman

So I ordered this car beginning of August from a main dealer. Looking to trade my car in and take out HP finance, they are offering 0% and they gave me a small discount. The car was on build plan in the factory 

Since I've ordered the car, the brand has put out an event giving ¬£1,000 off, and the actual dealer is offering ¬£2,500 too. Both specify finance, neither mention if it's HP or PCP. Would this be ¬£3,500 off or would the dealer be including the ¬£1,000 here? The offer states delivery completed by 31st September. My order last week was updated as ""built"" and didn't give any time for delivery 

Meanwhile I've been searching on Autotrader and I've found SEVERAL listings of this brand new car (delivery miles) with around ¬£6,000 - ¬£8,000 off, it's the same model and trim, just missing the options that I've selected (sunroof + branded speaker system)

A few weeks ago, I sent the offer information and Autotrader screenshots to the salesman asking what they could do for me, I received no reply

I'm avoiding sending another email regarding the event offer, is it possible they could delay delivery to force me out of this offer? Or am I thinking into it too much

What can I do to secure the best deal for me, and is there anyone I can get on my side regarding trying to get a lower price? I told them from the start I'd stuggle if the payments were any higher, and they were VERY keen to get a small deposit from me no matter what

You pay a **premium** for ordering a car. Cars almost always lose value the second their tires hit the floor. Imo 0% pcp or HP is a pretty banging deal which ever way you slice it. Especially if that 6 - 8k discount  you've seen on auto trader is then not financed via 0% cos you'll end up paying that in interest alone.

Cars are a luxury at the end of the day, Buying a new car is an even bigger luxury and sales people want their slice of the cake (commission) So as long as you sign on the dotted line they get their check.

**If you've still not taken delivery of the car, and you feel you physically struggle to pay the monthly payments i would suggest you check your agreement and see if you can pull out. It may however be at the cost of your deposit.** 

You wont be able to get a lower price because the car is brand new 0 miles, never used. You would have had to negotiate that at the time. Even if you show them other cars, They will just point out differences in yours, blah blah.

I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs usually a case that main dealers won‚Äôt necessarily budge on the actual price, but they may negotiate extras, such as an extended warranty or a service plan. If you can manage a service plan over two years, that‚Äôs worth several hundreds in itself. Having a one or two year Volvo warranty as well as, is also worth several hundreds. You won‚Äôt save initially, but you would in the long run. 

If you‚Äôre purchasing outright, don‚Äôt be surprised if they say no, when you say ‚ÄòI‚Äôm buying cash, can you reduce the price‚Äô. Dealers always have KPIs riding on finance. Consider taking finance, but cancelling/paying off within the first 30 odd days.

Nothing you can do about this if you insist on CANBUS being fooled, except an air cooled external resistor of about 12 ohms mounted somewhere cool

if you were trying to replace a 2-watt or 5 watt bulb it'd be far easier:  just route the bulb power feed to the coil of an automotive relay and use that to switch on the LED. Automotive relays have a coil resistance of 160-180 ohms and draw 1 to 2 watts, which is enough to fool Canbus.

Since DRLS are on all the time and likely in a confined space then this heat is likely killing them. I used to run LED lights with said resistor and 80% of their mass was a heatsink and fan.

If - IF - the Passat of that era came with optional LED DRLS, of which I don't know if they did, it should be possible to simply code them in.

I took the car to a BMW specialist who said it was the driver side seal, which they replaced. I kept noticing fresh drips and it was still wet there, they replaced again for free this time. 

After this I kept noticing fresh drips and alerted the dealership who said as I'm past the 3 month warranty period there's nothing they can do, I told them about the consumer rights act, to which they ignored my concerns and told me there's nothing they can do. 

I then notified my finance company and kept driving, telling them I'm requesting reimbursement for the money I paid for the replacement, as well as repair and diagnostic of this issue. Whilst driving one day the seal gave out fully and there is no longer differential oil in the differential, I had the car recovered to my house where it's been sitting. 

I've had no word from the finance company to say what kind of resolution they will give me, nor anything to indicate they are working on the case actively, I've called many times just to essential be told keep waiting for the case handler. I've also asked if I could repair it myself for my own cost and be reimbursed, however, they told me that at some point they'd need to send out an independent inspector to inspect what's wrong with the car, however they aren't at that point yet. The case with the finance company has been ongoing for 32 days as of writing. 

At this point I'm not sure where to go next, I have a car that is undriveable and I'm still paying finance/tax for. Do I threaten FCA action against the finance company? Do I go to the motor ombudsman for the dealership? As they are signed up to it? Or something else entirely.
