1nprz99,Can anyone help me with my bmw??,"my 2013 x5 35i is at 150000mls and about 2-3 weeks ago the car slips when changing gears, almost like jolts forwards and then the rpm’s drop and jump around a little bit. it’s progressively gotten worse and i stopped driving it last week. when it started to get worse i got a transmission failure light and went into limp mode, this light has come on everytime i drive the car more than extra gentle. i’m going to take it to a bmw center but can anyone help me pinpoint some different issues it could be and how much it might cost me??

side note: i’m not sure if it could be related but when i first start up the car there is a unusually loud vibrating sound that comes from around the engine area i believe, it gets slightly less quiet after about 30 seconds but it continues as i drive and when accelerating it seems to get louder again.",1,1758758081.0,4,MechanicAdvice,1758828926,2025-09-24 23:54:41,2025-09-25 19:35:26,"66NickS (Score: 1): The rattling sound is potentially some free play in the turbocharger waste gate assemblies.

1nprwa3,Fraser 10r80 replacement?,"2019 4wd ranger with 98k miles, experiencing the notorious CDF drum symptoms, and am limited on funds so I am looking to replace the transmission on my own. Right when the problems started I saw that new 10r80's could be had for ~$3100 from levittownfordparts, but Ford doubled the MSRP about two weeks in while I was waiting to have enough money saved up, so now that is just out of reach at ~$5k. I understand Fraser has a mixed reputation, but right now it's either that or waiting and hoping that a local salvage yard gets one, which isn't likely, the salvage market here doesn't seem to be very great. 

Anybody have experience with them? This truck will be paid off in 3 years, so as long as it makes it long enough to trade it in then I will be happy with us, I have just seen some very mixed opinions regarding Fraser, and remember about 6 years ago having a local mechanic tell me to steer clear of their motors when I was looking at replacing a 3.7l V6 on a Grand Cherokee I had.


The price looks good on them, and there isn't a shop local to me that is rebuilding 10r80's, so that is out of the question as well. I don't see how they could be a bigger gamble than a salvage 10r80 as I can afford the 3 year warranty with it and the Fraser SHOULD have the updated components,, but am reaching out to make sure that they aren't just absolute garbage.

1nppckv,Do Brake Rotors Soften From Brake Fluid Saturation?,"I recently had new brake pads installed at a national named service center on my 2013 Ford Escape. The store manager told me that my caliper pistons needed pushed back in, because they wouldn't function properly. So my brake pads were replaced, and my brake line flushed and filled only. The manager told me everything looked good, and they would recheck the calipers when I returned for state inspection in a couple of months.

  
A week later I get a low brake fluid warning on my dashboard. Sure enough, the brake fluid is low and none is in the reservoir. The calipers that had the pistons pushed back  in both failed and were leaking brake fluid. I could not go back to the service store that did the work because it was 100 miles away. So I took my car to another corporate owned service center to look at my brakes just a few miles away.

  
I was told that my calipers failed on my two rear wheels. There was brake fluid all over everything. I was told by this different service center that I would need to replace the calipers. I would also need to replace the brake pads, because the store manager told me that they absorb brake fluid - and would now be brittle and fail upon use in mere days. The store manager also told me that I would need to replace both of my rotors because the brake fluid would soften them... since the brake fluid got ""baked in"" as he called it.

  
Can brake rotors soften because they are coated in brake fluid? I think that I was lied to, and got charged for an unnecessary repair.

However my only issue is that as a temp fix we haven't filled any anti freeze and just water, I can max drive for about 15 to 20 min before it over heats and starts steaming/boiling. Is the color of this water normal? Its not foamy or frothy and has normal water consistently mostly looks and feels like dirty water, to add more the radiator fan doesnt always work, i need to play with the wires for the fan to start turning :)

Do these seem like serious issues like a blown head gasket or more related to the coolant box/ radiator

A byproduct of AC is that it creates condensation. That condsation is collected and drained to the outside of the car.

Fun fact: the AC is turned on automatically when you turn on the defrost. The moisture trapping side effect of AC drys the air which is then blown on the windshield. That dry air absorbs the moisture on the windshield which makes it defrost faster. If your ac doesnt work, defrost will take longer to clear the windshield.

Truck stalled, then only clicked and would not crank. This was after driving 100+ miles that day.

1. Replaced starter solenoid (passenger side) → no fix. 
2. Replaced starter motor → truck then cranked and started normally. 
However, after 2–3 good starts, it died on 3rd start when tried to drive truck and while backing up (drove a total of 10–15 feet before it just died and wouldnt start again). 

Since then: cranks strong but will not start.

1npi91d,Need Urgent Help - '01 Honda Accord,"(pic for attention) + OBD2 codes

Hey everyone! Posting in a new group for the millionth time hoping to hear from someone. 

Does anyone on here have experience with EPS in these 6th gen Hondas? 

It's become the bane of my existence and I really don't want to (nor can I) sell this car. It's so far been more financially feasible to invest in this car. 

That said, I've now run into an issue that has my head spinning.
The diagnosis is that my car needs a new steering rack
 

The symptoms are (in order of appearance):

- steering getting stuck when turning
- loud sounds from the driver side front tyre/axle area when turning (as if something in popping in and out of place)
- started off minimal, aggravated within hours
- EPS light switched on after a lot of struggling

my EPS module was replaced last year (it becan to randomly switch on and cause the steering to become stiff, switching the car on and off would resolve the issue).

After replacement, I had zero EPS issues until a month ago when after a routine suspension ""inspection"", my car returned home from the shop with these physical issues.

After consulting several enthusiasts+mechanics, i have a mix of opinions. Apparently these codes appear for all kinds of reasons. Connection issues/bad grounding etc. 

That said, in this case the issue isn't just electronic, it feels mechanical too. 


My question is: Is there any way to confirm the steering rack issue before I have my baby ripped apart?
I'm ready order a new one but I have cold feet.


Help a gal out, guys. I don't think I trust my mechanic.

It was right enough that it seemed normal, was marked as the right part on advance autos site, and threaded on like I felt like it should.

I get out, hear it sounds a little weird so I shut it off immediately. Notice when I started it, it immediately poured all the oil out around the filter. 

Ended up getting the correct filter, cleaning up and filling it again. Started the car and everything sounds normal, no dash lights no extra noise and drove it for a few miles and everything seems normal.

At first we had the filler neck, gas cap, and even the fuel tank replaced. When the light came back on a few days later, we had the VSV valve on the charcoal canister, and the canister iteself, replaced. The light came back on a few days later. I decided to stop trying to fix it because each repair had been costly, and when my boyfriend + dad drove it, they couldn't smell fuel (sometimes I thought I could smell it a bit) but then I started to see a small fuel leak so I took it back in. They thought maybe the seal around the fuel tank needed to be cleaned or replaced, so they cleaned it and put it back. Light turned off, then came on again a few days later. 

My boyfriend smelled fuel for sure a few months later, so we brought it back. Now they are saying the other VSV valve and purge valve by the engine are deteriorated as they are original, and no vapor is flowing through them (though they actuate electronically)- I'm just wondering, why would they have not seen these valves as an issue before? How can they keep replacing things that are not the cause of the issue, if other parts of the evap system are clearly corroded or faulty- but they don't see these until the next time I bring it in? Why wouldn't they point these ALL out at once (eg they replaced one valve but nobody mentioned that the front two valves have no vapor flow through them)? It's been to two different mechanics for this issue. 

  
I'm wondering if it's worth it to pay over $700 to replace these two valves, when I have no trust that these are actually the cause of the issue since so much has been pointed to as 'the cause' already. Odds that this is ACTUALLY the cause? I know it's a tricky system in a 4runner but it has probably been in 5-6 times for the same issue.

With that said I will not be driving the car until January. Because of this I am trying to understand if I should do something now or just wait until I will be officially driving the vehicle?

When the car is off, the airbag system is in a “safe” mode but there is a capacitor within the airbag controller that stores enough electricity to ignite the squibs in the inflators. That charge is depleted after 60-90 seconds of a power loss(key off or battery disconnected).

On the 17th, I was driving to work and noticed the entire car and steering wheel was shaking after I took my foot off the gas pedal and a loud noise coming from the front left tire. Called the dealership and scheduled service at 8 am on the 18th. 

After waiting 3 hours at the dealership and driving 30 minutes there, the mechanic told me that none of the 4 wheels were properly installed to the axle, the tire was missing a lug nut, and the worker who did the CPO inspection had quit a week prior. Not to mention, the auto unlock feature doesn’t work and the brakes screech every time I come to a full stop. They got all four wheels properly installed and put a lug nut on the tire that day, and ordered a new viscous coupler to install when it delivers (estimated by the 25th). This was all under warranty so I didn’t have to pay (bumper to bumper for first 12,000 miles or 1 year).

My salesman was shocked after I told him all this, and assured me via email with the GM cc’d that they will be doing another CPO inspection the next time I come in for service. 

I’m usually not one to complain, but this is a reputable dealership in NE Ohio. They let me drive off the lot in a car which was not road ready, and could have caused accident. I paid more for the CPO so I wouldn’t have to worry about issues like this. Feel like I got duped. After I go to the dealership next, I will likely have spent around 2 hours driving there and back, and 6 hours waiting at the dealership.

Cherry on top: I got a call today from my old dealership saying they had not yet received payment from these guys for the buyout of my old car.

Is there anything additional I can ask for from them to remedy this? Additional warranty period? Should I take the car back? Anything?

1npialw,The joy of car problems in rural areas,"Im 41/f, single, no family/connections. I live in a rural part of Minnesota and in a tiny town with 2 places within walking distance to a mechanic, i only have 1 automobile. Luckily, my job is within walking distance. 
I drive a 2006 Buick Rainier. Great condition when I bought it 5 years ago. 

I need to vent about my last 2 months. 
3 years ago someone tboned me in my front passenger. Thats all said and done obviously, time has passed, I didn’t use their insurance $ to fix it. That’s not what im posting for. Im posting to vent about my experience trying to make the buick stay alive for now, and wondering if these mechanics im dealing with is a typical experience or am i just cursed?

Yes, i know I should have gotten it fixed right away, but I didn’t.

My windshield wipers kept going off. Got new wiper kit installed for 400$. Few months later they became stuck in the up position. When i switch vent to window defrost, a constant loud knocking. Didn’t fix either. Replaced thermostat-400$. Don’t know if I needed to, but it was all wonky. 
My tire kept getting low. Found a screw in it. I kept blowing it up and mentioned it to a coworker who offered to 
Plug it. He did, and pointed out a tie rod was bent and a front tire was bald due to accident. 
I made appointment with mechanic to fix tie rod. Then I realized they might take me by my diagnosis. I don’t know anything about anything, so I went to mechanic in person and said, “i know I said tie rod, but I don’t know my parts and I think everything needs replacing “. He smirked and said hed see at my appointment in a week. 
I bring it in after a coworker follows me there for my ride home. Im in the middle of nowhere and the shop was 10 miles away. The next morning i get a text from the shop that says , “its driveable for now.”
I called and said I wanted it all fixed. No tone to my voice, polite. 
He said, “well you told me it was the left tie rod, it was the right. And I need to put it up before I know what is going on with it.” 
Yes. Completely understandable. ….but I thought that’s what i was asking for…? To see what it needs? 
He said I should have gotten a quote from a dealer…but it is years later, im just paying for it. Then he told me to find my own parts in salvage yards and …im just exhausted. I have no support in my life to do these things. I don’t understand why he can’t just help me. 
I really wanted to pick my car up that night so id have a car, so my coworker let me use her credit card so I didn’t have to wait to pay in cash the next day. I don’t have a credit card. 
I called to make the payment and he asked for the address. I said,”the address for the card, right?”  
“No. The address for the home.”
“But you mean for the card?”
“No, the home.”
So i have him my home address. So confused. Hung up, called back with my coworkers address. By this time, I think he was fed up with me. He was going to contact me if he found parts, but never did. 

Then got brand new 500$ tires put on (due to balding caused by front end damage) after that same mechanic told me to do it because itll be ok for atleast 1k miles without wear ( i was bringing to different place for that.) i had that other place check other tires because one was still going low ( same one as before). 
They replaced the valve stem. Two weeks later the same tire is going low. So they didn’t rotate rear tires after getting 2 new front ones. Don’t know if that’s typical. I brought it back and they put in another plug saying they found a nail in it.
So now ive got 2 new michillen tires on it and a messed up front sway bar/whatever, don’t know all of it. But need it fixed asap. Front tire is angled so bad. Brought it to a place that will get it fixed days after appointment, not look at it till 24 hours after appointment drop off , because they were within walking distance. Same place I got thermostat replaced and they never let you know when it’s complete. You have to keep hounding them. And when I brought it in for thermostat I asked them to plug screw in tire over phone and added note while dropping off keys, but after driving a little bit, i heatd the screw on the pavement. They just said,oops, I thought that was fixed. 
So, made an appointment to finally get the whole front sway bar situation fixed, along with whatever else…..told them to inspect it and order whatever they need..i just need it fixed!!!I got money!!!just fix!!!
Mind you, I’ve been walking out on a rural but busy highway in dark in crazy fog time and time again…
Takes an extra day than they told me for the parts. Understandable!! Ill walk to work. Its fine. I walk back out there, no sleep ( i just switched to night shift at a factory) and they show me all the rusty holes in the frame and tell me its junk in a year or so. 
That sucks, what are ya gonna do? Ill deal.
But how come all this time, all these trips to mechanics, nobody noticed till now? 
I get onto the highway and go to the next town 8 miles away for food because the town I live in has none. My abs breaks go nuts, stabilitrak haywire and my wheels don’t work together.

Dealer has a bundle deal for undercoating and a “diamond ceramic” paint protection. About 15 yr rust warranty with the 2. The product for undercoating is “Auto Armor” and is petroleum based. They also do rust proofing by accessing the plugs in panels and use paraffin for that. All this would run me around $1050.

Unless you've got a work truck and running miles of gravel roads every day you're probably not going to ""rust out"" a new car in 15 yrs (though it will start surface rust after just a few years and progress over those years), it's after that where you run into the bigger problems (hence the warranty term, it's unlikely to become a repair issue before then, though you'll lose resale value with years of unprotected rust, and the decay damage is already done at that point. You might be and to slow or stop the decay progression with wet film lanolin at that point later in life, but way better to have just prevented it early before it starts. Can think of it kind of like dental care, maybe..?

Though brand new is the best/only time if you were going to do a dry/paint coating, personally, I don't think the ROI is there for the cost. Instead, I'd start right away coating it with a wet film lanolin undercoat. Annual recoat schedule for woolwax/fluid film, every 2 yrs for Surface Shield. But 95%+ of that oil coating isn't ever going to wash off between coatings (so most of the underside of your car will look effectively like brand new behind the oil coating - see 7yr comparison test video from RepairGeek for a perfect example of no coating vs lanolin coating at 7 yrs for a new vehicle), and it's the best long-term protection you can get. Additive reapplication means in the long-run, even once it's older, you can just keep reapplying over the top. Where if paint/rubber gets a scratch now it's retaining water behind the coating and accelerating a hole rusting out there - and reapplication requires full paint prep. 

I've written about rust and undercoating on my website, including details on why I think wet film lanolin is generally a better option and better ROI than dry coatings, and how to diy spray it on your own vehicle if you want to:

As an owner of the same year make and model, I have some tips.

You need to use jack stands. Never trust just a jack (especially the scissor jack under the cargo hold). This is less about brakes and this model than it being good practice that could potentially save your life. Also, it never hurts to chock the wheels with a couple pieces of wood.

Dont engage the e brake (common sense but still worth mentioning). 

Turn your wheels so the brake you're working on is easier to access.

You need to remove the lug nuts in a star formation and later, replace them in a star formation.

Buy a manual vaccum brake bleeder kit. They aren't expensive and you will need to get the excess air out of the brake lines when you're done because 05 Outbacks require you to remove the caliper to swap pads. If you skip this step, you'll end up with a soft pedal which could cause your brakes to fail and your car to crash. You can do it without the kit, but it's much easier, quicker, and more effective to just use the kit. 

You have to remove the caliper to replace the brake pads. Lefty loosy righty tighty applies looking from the INSIDE of the tire. So drivers side to loosen you turn to the the rear of the vehicle but on the passenger side you turn to the front of the vehicle. I had to replace my caliper guiding bolts because my dumbass didn't think it through properly the first time.

You need a 4in C clamp to press the caliper back so it fits over the new pads. Use the old brake pad as a plate to apply pressure evenly.

When you bleed the brakes, start from the brake farthest from the main cylinder reservoir. If you're doing the front brakes only, you bleed the passenger side first and then the driver side.

Buy Dot 3 brake fluid to refill the reservoir after it's bled. DO NOT ALLOW IT TO GO BELOW THE MINIMUM LINE. I'd add some on top before you start and check the level periodically. If it's overfull at the end of the job, use a turkey blaster to remove the fluid above the max fill line.

The inner front pads can be a bitch to slide in without looking at them. Be patient, it requires exact placement to slide in. This is where having the car on jack stands is helpful because you can safely slide under for a better vantage point.

You need a torque wrench. You just do. If you over tighten the lug nuts it can fuck up everything you just worked on, plus everything it's connected to. Buy it, learn how to use it, tighten your nuts to the recommended torque.

Brakes are honestly pretty simple on the 05 Outback, but like any job that requires the removal and re installation of parts, you need to do to do it properly. Especially when you're fucking with tires. You do NOT want to find out your brakes are soft when you need to stop or slow down. You definitely don't want your lug nuts snapping on the highway or your tire ejecting on a turn.

Again, not a mechanic, but I'm on my second 05 Outback and have been working on this car specifically for about 7 years.

Hot-Interest-3968 (Score: 1): I mean that depends on which side is worse. If the fronts are worse do them first. If the rears are worse do them first.

secondrat (Score: 1): Yes. You only need to replace them when needed.  If the back brakes have lots of life left just leave them until they need to be replaced. 

It would be a good idea to bleed the brakes to flush out the old fluid.  It will help your brake system last longer.  But if you don’t have a helper or know what you’re doing I would skip it."

On 4/23/25 I took the Accord (at 124,336 miles) into a big name service center who was having a ""Buy a Brake System Flush, get a Cooling System Flush for Free"" -- both of which were recommended by the dealership during the previous service.

The ""Cooling System Exchange"" includes:

""Inspect the cooling system, pressure test for leaks, inspect drive belts and radiator hoses, connect coolant machine, completely exchange old coolant with new, and refilling with up to 2 gallons of new extended life antifreeze.""

Well, Sat, 09/20/25 the Accord (126,526 miles) posted a ""**P2601: Coolant Pump ""A"" Control Circuit Range/Performance**"" error, the power was reduced, until ultimately the care shut it's self off. I popped the hood a noticed the coolant reservoir was COMPLETELY empty. I got some coolant, added enough to drive home without a problem.

I'm trying to think of a reason why the coolant would run out in 5 months - 2200 miles. Obvious leaks and hose issues, etc. would show signs of evaporation, as well as, leaking where the car is parked every night -- both of which there were no signs off.  Am I missing something? Any recommendations, or thoughts, before I contact the service center? Thank you in advance.

Did they use a hydrometer to test if your coolant is still good?  No

Did they send a sample of the transmission fluid off to be tested and ensure you havent had it done? 
No

Did they actually test the brake fluid? 
No


The coolant and trans is from a guy who sits at a computer and it gives him mileage intervals that correspond to nothing. 

Its a guess

The brake fluid (at best) they use a tester that determines moisture content based on moisture in the fluid because brake fluid is Hydroscopic as well as Hygroscopic  absorbing water and bonding on a molecular level. Unlike oil and water that wont mix

I’ve got a 2011 Ford Ranger XLT (automatic, ~47k miles) that I bought used last year. It’s been mostly solid, but I’ve been dealing with some transmission weirdness and now a leak that’s making me nervous.

The truck has slipped into gear maybe a couple times a week, not constantly but enough to notice. Recently I spotted transmission fluid pooling under it after parking. When I crawled under, I saw that a bolt on the transmission housing is completely missing. It doesn’t look like it just rattled out — it looks like it was never put back in or possibly removed. The dealer I bought it from already tried to dodge me on front-end damage when I called them out, so I don’t exactly trust how they handled this truck before selling it.

What I’m trying to figure out is whether a missing bolt could be the reason for the leak, or if it’s more likely pointing to a bigger issue like the front pump seal going bad. I’m also wondering if bolts like this ever just work themselves out with age, or if this looks more like tampering or a shady patch job.

2019 Ford Fusion SE

112,000 km

Automatic Transmission

Hi everyone!

So my car finally is on it's last legs, and I've always had terrible, terrible luck with used cars. This time, I decided to spend some more money, and bought a car at a dealership.

I bought a used 2019 Ford Fusion on the reccommendation of my local mechanic shop whom I'm on good terms with. This was after showing them a few options I was looking at, and they informed me they haven't had a Ford Fusion in their shop with any major issues, and the dealership (which is some travel time away in another city) is quite reputable.

I test drove the car, city, highway, low speed, flooring it, and it all seemed great. They cleaned it the following day, and I went in and bought it, registered it, and drove it off the lot, with intention to take it back to my local shop to throw up on the lift and inspect, as they told me they would do for me for free.

As soon as I hit the highway, the check engine light came on. After some mental deliberation I returned to the dealership and told them what happened. The technicians had left for the day, but we scanned it to see the issue. I don't recall the name of the part, but it was explained to me it was a code from a sensor that... (If i recall correctly) Makes adjustments to the speed of the engine based on city or highway. (Something like that.)

The manager quickly checked under the hood to ensure it wasn't a loose connection, and when it wasn't, they gave me another vehicle and told me they would have look at it tomorrow.

Well today is tomorrow, and I hadn't heard back so I called the service desk at the dealership, and she told me she didn't have much information, but they were replacing (Something small I think, that I don't recall), and the timing chain.

Now on a previous vehicle I had a timing chain fail and it resulted in a new engine. Because the car didn't sound like an explosion, and that I was able to drive it back to the dealership, I assume the timing chain isn't broken, but perhaps was worn out in some way.

How concerned should I be?
I'm sure it's a pain in the ass for both parties, and I'd probably lose out on money in some way, but I could maybe try and get a different vehicle. Or what are the chances the car I'm getting after these repairs is likely in better shape than an average 2019 would have been, because it has recent repairs?",1,1758752305.0,7,AskMechanics,1758828926,2025-09-24 22:18:25,2025-09-25 19:35:26,"czechFan59 (Score: 1): Did they provide a warranty?

1npobp6,Do I really need to redline my 2012 Volkswagen Passat to avoid carbon buildup?,"Hey everyone,

I recently bought a 2012 Volkswagen Passat 2.5 SE with only 40,000 miles. The car is in pristine condition and drives super smooth. Since I bought it, I’ve replaced the engine oil, brake fluid, transmission fluid, and power steering fluid. I also had it inspected and there are no leaks.

I only drive about 500 miles a month, mostly city/highway mix. In the last 9 months, I’ve put on around 4,000–4,500 miles. I generally drive pretty gently — my RPMs rarely go above 2,000. My thought process was that smoother, slower driving = less wear and tear = longer life for the car.

But recently, a friend of mine (who knows cars well) rode with me and told me that I “drive like a grandpa.” He said these Volkswagens actually need to be revved up and redlined to 6,000–7,000 RPM every once in a while, otherwise I’ll end up with carbon buildup that could shorten the car’s life.

So now I’m wondering:

Is it true that I need to rev the engine hard occasionally to keep things clean?

Am I actually doing more harm than good by babying the car?

What’s the right balance between driving smooth and preventing carbon issues?


Would love to hear from mechanics or VW owners who’ve dealt with this before.

Hey everyone,

I recently made some changes to my car and I’ve noticed something concerning. Last week of August, I **replaced my brakes**, and shortly after, I got a **new set of 4 tires** (also did a **wheel alignment**).

Now, a month or so later, I started noticing a **burning rubber smell coming from the driver’s side top left tire**. I’m not sure if it’s related to the tire itself or something else.

I kind of regret going with **cheaper tires**—they’re from a company called **Lionhart**. Could this be a **tire quality issue**? Has anyone experienced something similar?

What would you guys suggest I do to check if it’s safe or if I need to replace something?

Take a look around the wheel maybe something is rubbing against the tyre? Check while car is on ground (not raised). 

Since you only notice the smell from one corner of the car its probably not an alignment issue.

1np5s67,White smoke from exhaust when accelerating,"Hi everyone, we have a Honda Odyssey 2009 and it's got nearly 380k miles. It still runs smoothly though, no starting problems, no knocking, no hesitation when accelerating, no stalling, temperature on dashboard seems good, etc.

But when accelerating there's white smoke coming from the exhaust, it isn't dense. I thought it could be coolant, but the level doesn't seem to drop even a bit. I also check both the coolant and oil to see if they are dirty or something but they are not. There's no milkshake, as I have seen people call it, everything is clean. So I hope it is not the head gasket.

We see the smoke when accelerating while in parking, like revving the engine. Or when accelerating after a red light. We're not sure if there's smoke while it is running, but probably the wind just gets rid of it and we can't notice it. Now, when idling there's no smoke at all, no matter how long you leave it there. But as soon you use that gas pedal, white smoke will come.

What could possibly be the cause? Is it something serious?

Lastly, a couple of months ago the check engine light turned on. It stayed on a couple days, then went off for a couple days, then came back and so on. But currently it's off, it's been a while since it went off, it didn't come back again. It just went away by itself.

1np5ggz,Update: World's Worst Kia Boy Strikes Again. Did Me A Favor?,"Look,

I would have loved to get my car into a shop as soon as possible, but I was having trouble getting the immobilizer back on the ignition, with the column being only cracked a little open. I was going to tinker with it a bit more, but I was:

1. Scared to break anything

2. Fed up enough to call a tow truck and be done with it.

Besides that fact, I'm broke, so I've been picking up extra shifts to get the car repaired.

...So imagine my frustration when my alarm goes off AGAIN, and the trashbag window I so carefully hung up is lying on the ground. Of course, the Kia boy managed to get the column completely off this time, but I got a visual on him. 

My first thought was ""Oh god, he cut the wires this time, now I'm really screwed"". But can you believe this loser actually didn't even manage to get that far the second time around? The column was fully off this time, but no wires were cut. So I thought, ""Wow, this would be the perfect time to try the immobilizer"".

And so I was able to back out of my driveway and back in. 

I'm gratified and even more humored by this second attempt. My question is, can you think of any issues driving this to the shop myself? The mechanic we love works not even a half a mile from my house, so it won't be far. The column is nearly fully off, so I'll have to get it popped back on either way (in a wreck, my legs would be gone).

1np0zhw,1/10 times will only crank.,"Hi, I’m about at Witt’s end with my 2009 Grand Vitara, as it’s been having trouble starting 5% of the time. I’ll drive it around but suddenly it will just crank, no start.

When I first purchased it, it had an inspection with nothing to note. Previously had a fuel pump replaced. After I brought it home, I went to the gas station and filled it up, it wouldn’t start. Like a guardian angel some mechanic and said to open the fuel cap and it started. The dealer I bought it from took it back to their mechanic and a week later said they replaced a cam sensor.

The car sat couple weeks while I sold the one I was currently driving. 

After I registered and insured the Vitara, I drove it for a week and again one time it just cranked no started. We hooked up jumper battery in case and waited. after a few minutes it started and we drove home.

I took it to where my partner goes for work but they are a small garage and only managed to charge the battery and check the alternator, and run some kind of diagnostic, which gave no result. 

I drove it around more and after another week of using it, again it wouldn’t start. This time I recorded it in case I needed it, and just waited for about 5 mins and after it cranked for a bit, it started. 

It also happened a few days ago, and We actually didn’t do anything. We went to lunch and 40 minutes later it started up no problem. 

It has not started 2x after a short 20-30 drive and sitting for 10 mins, another time where I was starting stopping a few times within a few hours. 

It’s at my mechanics right now and they said they can’t see anything wrong. Battery, alt, spark plugs have been checked. They drove it and nothing. They will be resetting the chip (forgot what it’s actually called) and then they said if that doesn’t work we would have to consider timing belt.

I'm curious on how the coil is still having issues when it's new and why the spark plug is having issues now after a new coil but it wasn't before.

It's a cop out, because the wet belt engines are dogshit unless they're festidiously maintained, but Ford are correct that you should be using specific types of oil designed for wet belt engines. These oils contain additives to protect the material the belt is made from, and will prevent it from swelling, perishing or cracking prematurely. 

In a large number of instances, these engines aren't even killed by full belt failure and de-timing. They're choked to death and heat seized because the belt starts to break down, disintegrate, and the debris blocks the oil pickup in the sump, causing oil starvation.

You pretty much don't have a leg to stand on because Ford are just going to say that you failed to follow OEM instructions on servicing and maintenance, and your car was maintained by independent mechanics that aren't approved by Ford.

1npkexk,Kia Ceed engine failure,"
Looking for some advice on what is going to be a very costly repair/replacement. 

My 2019 plate Kia Ceed is having some serious engine problems. Bought the car from a well known dealer 3 years ago and have had it serviced and MOT’d each year at the dealership and have never experienced any faults or issues other than a product recall for the Tandem pump (works completed at dealer).

It was last serviced 2 weeks ago. The other night my oil pressure warning light came on, my power dropped and my breaks failed, I had to use my hand break to bring the car to a stop.

I got my car recovered to the dealership, it had to be dragged onto the back of a truck as it now wouldn’t start. Dealership looks at it and confirms the engine is seized. 

Dealership has reached out to Kia to ask if they will cover works under the 7 year warranty. I’m doubtful Kia will approve this as the car missed its first scheduled service and so the warranty may be void. 

So the next option is for the dealership or me to foot the bill. Dealership is quoting hundreds just to open the engine up determine cause.

I feel it is too much of a coincidence that the car is serviced and then 2 weeks later catastrophic failure occurs. 

Is it possible that they may have messed something up whilst conducting the service? Should I be expecting the dealer to cover the cost if Kia won’t?

The car has no recorded service history but they agreed to doing a, quote, “interim service”. They also did the MOT for us and changed the break pads. The insurance for this car started today because we thought we were gonna pick it up today… but…

We went to see the car a week ago and, in knowing what the typical problems with A1’s are, checked the operation of the back windscreen washer - nothing was coming out but you could hear the motor working. We opened the boot and it was leaking quite badly in the back, but there were no signs of wet or damp or mould when we opened the boot before this. We told the second hand dealer about it and they claimed they didn’t know it was a problem (they had only just got the car in the day before our viewing), but they said they would get it sorted - whatever it needed doing. Our mechanic friend said it would most likely need a new motor because of where it was leaking.

A week later they told us it was done. We drove down today and the wipers are working.. all they did was unblock the holes. We opened the boot… it’s still leaking. We asked if the motor, as we asked for, had been replaced and it hadn’t been. They said, quote ‘the mechanic just showed us that the wipers were now projecting the fluid after unblocking the holes, it was unblocked so we assumed it wouldn’t be coming out the other end and called it a day”. We are close to pulling out of the deal because why has it gone through 2 people and no one has checked if it’s leaking in the back…? Is this dodgey or just basic complacency and they’re just being silly for not checking… clearly the mechanic is a friend with the dealership and they’ve just discussed unblocking the holes… the first thing you’d do and the cheaper thing instead of replacing the motor, and the wipers do work now (fluid coming out the right end) so they must’ve just accepted that and called it a day but i’m not sure what to do.

No one knows how longs it’s been leaking for, the previous owner was an elder who did a few miles here and there - condition of the car inside is perfect, outside there are 2 cosmetic scratches on the bumper and alloys are ever so slightly scuffed. Other than that it looks neat and is nice. Because we don’t know how long it’s been leaking for how can we be sure it’s not affected any electrics? As i said again it’s completely fine inside no damp or mould and how often do you use the bank windscreen wiper for it to cause a problem?

No harm in calling them up. But you'll probably need to go with a different insurer. Yours is clearly happy with you in a 207 and not in a Mazda3. Just because of what actuarial tables say.

You just need to weigh up whether the cost is worth it against the good deal of the car and the upgrade. Including losing out on building a bit of NCB.

On the latter it might be worth paying the extra (pro-rata) for a month or two so you get another year NCB before you switch. If you've just started a new year I wouldn't bother.

1npi7on,Do you actually get fines sent to you for not putting your uninsured vehicle on SORN even if you don’t drive it,"Does anybody have any experience in actually getting continuous insurance enforcement letters and fines when having a vehicle not on an SORN and uninsured but parked up on your driveway and undriven? I'm looking at buying a van with my friends that has a sauna built into the back of it, and most of the time we will just use it on my driveway, but maybe let's say once a week we might drive it out somewhere for an hour or two. So we can use temporary insurance to do so, which is a very reasonable price. But if I try to insure this van on me alone, never mind me and my three friends, continuously, it goes to astronomical levels of cost, looking at over £400 a month versus £60 to £100 a month in temporary insurance when we need it. But if I have it SORNed, then even if I get temporary insurance on it, I can't drive it because it's untaxed. I don't mind paying for tax and having a valid MOT on it, and paying temporary insurance any time I need to drive it, but this idea of me having to pay hundreds and hundreds of pounds of insurance every month for me just to keep it on my private driveway is absolutely ridiculous. So I'm just trying to see if I can get away with not having it insured on my driveway and insure it only when I take it out for an actual drive. Apparently in practice, ChatGPT says that there's an automated system by the DVLA that checks their records for vehicles registered with them and cross-checks insurance databases, and if it finds that the car is not insured and does not have an SORN, then you're liable to get a £100 fine in the mail and also have it escalated to court and have the car impounded etc. So I'm just asking in case anybody has any experience with this, and if so, what are good ways to get around this without having to pay stupid prices for insurance. Or maybe this continuous enforcement letter is just in practice not something that you get because the last person who had the van only would temporarily insure when he needed it and he was able to operate like that for years",0,1758734483.0,9,CartalkUK,1758828926,2025-09-24 17:21:23,2025-09-25 19:35:26,"Draven_crow_zero (Score: 6): Yes, it is likely that you'll get a fine now from DVLA as it is all digitised now so they know when you're not sorned or taxed, they could send a fine at any point but normally they give a fair bit of leeyway

The thing is, these prices are all dancing around the same ballpark, which got me thinking - are these online services essentially cut from the same cloth? Or is there actually merit in continuing this quote-gathering marathon?

1npd3vz,Practical country commuter that can do it all for less than £8k?,"It's finally time to upgrade my trusty 2007 Honda Civic 1.8 petrol i-vtec that has served me well over the years but has finally reached retirement age.

  
I now need something that can handle my varied commute, which is 50 minutes each way, half of which being on poorly maintained and often flooded country back roads, and the other half on smooth, fast dual carriageways.

My main priorities are a comfortable ride over the bumps and turns of the country lanes, and I'd like the ability to carry a load of stuff around - as good or better than my lie-flat honda seats (>500L ish).

I'm definitely looking for low running costs, ideally >50+mpg and low tax, plus ULEZ/Low Emission Zone friendly, along with great durability, reliability and longevity.

I'm interested in compact SUVs as I've never driven one, but imagine they'd be a comfortable ride and deal with the country conditions well, but I'm concerned they'd feel bulky and oversized, so have been somewhat leaning towards the estate models.

I know I'm asking a lot of one car, particularly on a budget, but my research so far has pointed to a few options.

Currently on the shortlist:

* Mazda CX-5 (2015 onwards, 2.2 Skyactiv-D Euro 6)
* Skoda Octavia Estate (2013 onwards 1.6/2.0 TDI Euro 6 or 1.4/1.5 TSI petrol)
* Mazda6 Tourer (2012 onwards, 2.2 Skyactiv-D Euro 6)

  
Honourable mentions that I'd be interested to hear opinions on:

* Volvo V60/V60
* Toyota Auris Touring Sports (2015–2018, Hybrid or Euro 6 petrol/diesel)
* VW Golf Estate/Passat

1npcvv3,Windscreen pit triggering OCD I didn't even know I had,"I suppose this is part car talk, part therapy! I basically have a tiny pit mark on the windscreen of my company car. It's like 1mm wide, so too small for a repair even if it was a proper chip, let alone a surface pit like it is.

The thing is though, it's in my eye line so I sometimes see it when I'm driving and it's been driving me crazy for months, and I'm not even sure why. There are many reasons why it shouldn't, including:

1) It's a pit mark, so the windscreen will be fine. Plus, I know you can't do anything about these, and even the best professional attempt at 'fixing it' would still leave it visible.

2) It's tiny, and I only see if maybe a third of the time I'm driving, all depending on lighting etc.

3) The car runs absolutely fine, obviously this doesn't effect it at all apart from slightly visually.

4) It's a company car, so it's not even mine. In three years it'll be gone!

Only recently started to use oil (0.5 litre between changes, so not horrendous, but didn't use to use a drop). I think this is due to the timing cover seal but doesn't warrant investigation at the minute.

Still gives every ounce of boost the ECU requests and still estimates itself around 150hp so by all accounts in good nick. I think doing an oil change frequently is a massive plus to the engine life but equally I'm mechanically sympathetic (I don't boot it when cold and give it 20-30 seconds on tickover if I park just after using a lot of boost). 

I did have catastrophic HPFP failure at \~120k miles. Depending on where you ask this is either very common or very rare... you can judge for yourself. I haven't heard many other people having this issue personally. I think I'd be more worried at how tired the suspension will be at that age. From about 3-4 years ago I started needing to replace substantial parts of the suspension and since they are mostly alu it can be pricey/not so straight forward.

1np7a9a,Keep or sell/ new car recommendations.,"Hi all need some advice please .

I’ve got a 2011 SEAT Leon 1.6 TDI DSG with 93k miles. New problem( high pitched sound above 30mph and engine ticking at idle) just appeared and the garage reckon it’s either the dual-mass flywheel/ clutch(DMF) or injectors starting to fail. On top of that, for this year’s MOT it needs front discs & pads and the rear passenger door lock mechanism replacing (door won’t open from outside; opens fine from inside and once opened from inside then it works fine ) the garage quoted £150–£170 for the lock.

Putting everything together the garage says I’m looking at at least £1500–£2000 minimum to keep it running properly (DMF or injectors + brakes + door). I’m trying to decide whether it’s worth repairing or whether I should be looking for a replacement and part-exchanging this for around £1,100.


Is it worth spending ~£1–1.5k on this Leon? I want something that will get me through 2-3years without too much bother.

If I move on, what are realistic automatic alternatives in the £5–7k range that are likely to be reliable for 3–4 years? (I’d prefer something automatic and preferably ulez complaint .)

1np6p2p,Thieves using car selling websites to find cars to nick?,"I woke up this morning to a knock on the door and my next door neighbour asking if our Ring camera covers his drive (it didn't) and news that his car has been stolen (2020 2.0 Ford Ranger with loads of optional extras in fantastic condition). 

One of the neighbours up the road has CCTV of a couple of lads rocking up on a bike at midnight, then one jumping off it. Next thing the car is gone, no video of the actual theft. I'm assuming that given it's keyless entry and how close it's parked to the house the thieves used the relay technique.

He mentioned that he was looking at selling it a week or so ago, and told me this morning that he accepted an offer on Motorway for ~£4k above what WBAC would pay (£18500). He then changed his mind and cancelled the sale as another car he wanted to buy fell through or something, but not before sending the dealer his address. 

The dealer is a 4x4 dealer based in Surrey, we're in Nottinghamshire. Motorway asked when the car would be available to collect and it happened to be stolen on one of the days listed. It seems a bit of a coincidence that all of this happened in the days leading up to the car being stolen. Googling the dealer and checking companies house they appear to be legit (although 17 five star only reviews on Google all in the last year for a business founded in 2017 seems a bit suspicious). 

For what it's worth given the thieves showed up on a bike in the middle of the night I'm assuming they're probably from Nottingham and using the Surrey dealer as a cover.

I'm wondering if anyone has heard, of or experienced, having a car stolen after selling via Motorway or any other websites that ultimately send the address of the seller to the buyer? It'd be a doddle to search for the year/model of a desirable and easily nickable car, put in a high offer and then steal it at a date the owner has said it will be at a specific location.

I feel really sorry for the bloke, he's 78 and loved that car. I've a suspicion they police won't even turn up and just give him a crime reference number.

The cost of self servicing (good brand filters, brakes, oil, tyres etc), including a recent cam belt change at a garage for the vehicle is £3000 (yup - I have a spreadsheet). I paid £13.5k for the car.

Fuel over the last few years costs about £100 a month, so let's use that as a benchmark and imagine the price of fuel was fixed. That would work out to be a total of £12k in fuel over 10 years.

- Car: £13,500
- (Self) Servicing: £3,000
- Fuel: £12,000

I have had an Abarth 500 in the past, but the ride over potholes and rough roads is grim at best. I'm not saying no to another, but fancy trying something different.

So this has led me to the Twingo RS 133. A car which I dismissed as a 20-something but now I'm a bit a older and wiser and I find myself intrigued. Are there any owners here who can give some input on what they're like to live with, if they are reliable, fuel economy, etc?

I'm not adverse to a Twingo GT either, with the 1.2 turbo and a cheeky wee remap. Anyone had one?

Or is there something else I'm missing? I know the Suzuki Swift will come up, but I just don't like the look of the things at all. I'd love a 182 but I think it would get a hammering doing 14,000 miles a year.

RaymondBumcheese (Score: 6): I had one of these after my 172 got written off and its a great b-road battler but 28 miles would get old very quickly. If you didn't like the ride in the Abarth, this is harder.

Its very fun, though. Drive a slow car fast and all that. You can drive 30mph everywhere, put it around a roundabout on its door handles and the NA engine means it doesnt leave anything on the table. I had a lot of fun with mine but eventually I got a 56m commute (28 each way, 20m b-roads, 8m a-roads) and chopped it for a golf gti purely because its far more civilised.

As with all Renaults, make sure its been serviced and they have done the belts because that is a pain in the arse.

1np41v5,Vauxhall Combo C Seat Upgrade?,"I've been driving this old ex-postvan Vauxhall Combo C for a couple years now, but the seats have always given my back grief on long journeys - thinking of either replacing them with some SXi seats if i can find them (not sure how much better they'll be) or modifying seats an old Vectra.

Any good recommendations for seats that'll fit? Either that or just some good aftermarket back supports or lumbar pillows, every one I've tried so far hasn't really helped.

(Seats were replaced semi-recently with the standard model so I don't think it's just seat wear)",1,1758692029.0,1,CartalkUK,1758828926,2025-09-24 05:33:49,2025-09-25 19:35:26,"LukasDW (Score: 1): You'd have better luck in the Vauxhall sub, or on Vauxhall specific forums.

1np2kwn,Will my policy get cancelled?,"Hello all! Just wanting some opinions

I recently passed my test and bought myself a car, a Saab 9-3 2lr, more for sentimental purposes as it was the exact same as what my late father had. 

I anticipated high insurance prices as to an insurance company, as I can understand, a 2lr turbo with a newly passed 19 year old behind the wheel looks like a recipe for disaster. 

So after some digging, a lot of repetitive refreshing on multiple comparison sites on my computer - I gave up. Then a few hours later, ventured back onto money super market, this time searching on my phone. 

It had saved all my details, apart from one - the purchase year of my car (saved the month though!)

so to my delight, a £200 a month policy seemed absolutely incredible, and I could’ve sworn I checked myself to see if I made a mistake - I didn’t think I had, but I did.

Following an email earlier from Admiral asking to see my V5 document, I decided to actually sit down and go though my full downloadable documentation. And to my horror there it was, purchase date: 09/2020, not 2025. 

So now I’m effectively sh**ing myself, I’ve had a bit of a look around at other insurance options, which all quote me something ridiculous (£9000 is the average). I’m prepared for a hike from 200 to 300 with admiral, but am convinced that the purchase date once they amend it is going to flag up, and make the policy type invalid. 

So then, what would you suggest I do? Ring them up? Send my documents and pray it’s just a price hike? Or take the 14 days no questions asked cancellation they offer. 

For a bit of background too (incase anyone has any sort of tactics they could suggest with this information) I’m a 19 year old working in the ambulance service, we’ve recently been put out of quite a bit of work due to Keir’s 10 year NHS plan, and the work we can now pick up usually requires driving some distance to get there. So driving is essential for me. 

Please do let me know if any of you have had the same experience and how it went for you, I do want to be honest now that I know but I’m not sure anything is going to work out in my favour with this one.

Electronic_Laugh_760 (Score: 4): Just call them.

Explain your mistake. See what the price changes to. (It may be £10 a month more maybe £100 - who knows with insurance).

If it’s too expensive there and then on the phone CANCEL it. Do not wait or think about it.

Hitby (Score: 2): Not that I'd advocate lying to insurers but a new V5 is issued every time you move. You could have easily had the car for 5 years and have a recently issued doc."
1noynj0,What can I expect to change concerning insurance prices?,"Hi all, long time lurker and first time poster in this sub!

In March 2026, I will have 3 major milestones ticked off: I will already be 21, I will have held my license for a full year, and I will have one year of named driver experience on my dads policy.

I checked a couple of months ago, how much it would cost to insure my MK8 Civic Type S in my name, and it came out to £3k a year with a black box. I also checked how much it would cost to insure a C class merc and…. I wish I hadn’t, hahaha, quotes started at like £10k or something, I can’t remember exactly.

So my point is, I know insurance prices will drop, but what kind of prices can I expect to see? Any chance of insuring something more fun?

Thanks all!

Also type S Hondas are quite dear to insure (again in my experience) my brother had a 2.2 (stock) one the same as yours there and my Mazda 3 with a remap (declared on insurance) is £100 cheaper for me to insure.
