1mg51pz,Stuck in my 2018 Civic Forever,"As my car stacks on the miles, the reality that ""Ruby"", my 2018 Honda Civic Touring, isn't going to last forever becomes more and more prevalent in my mind, and with that, the dread of finding her replacement. What I'm learning is that my favorite thing about her and A MUST HAVE, in my opinion, just isn't a thing anymore. Ruby has what's called LaneWatch. It's a passenger side-mirror camera that you can live view your blindspot at any time. This is the only thing like it that I know of. Other cars with the side mirror camera are only activated when the turn signal is on. I want to see it before I signal and maybe not every time I signal. This game changing feature was replaced by a little blind spot indicator light. It feels like such a step in the wrong direction. Going from a live, real-time view of everything on the side of your vehicle to a little orange light telling me there's something there that I should check out is a painful notion for me.",0,1754179085.0,6,CarTalk,1754230438,2025-08-02 23:58:05,2025-08-03 14:13:58,"Old_Confidence3290 (Score: 2): Progress sucks, but your car is a lot newer than mine.

hi everyone! i am a 17 year old girl, and i have never really had much interest in cars throughout my life. i didnt have a male influence around that particularly cared about cars, so it never really become one of my 'things'. i was always art, music, and film, so it never even entered my mind, though i always liked how cars looked (especially mid 1900s cars).

since meeting my father, i have learned that he is really into cars. he even got me a $2200 2008 volkswagen rabbit. im in love with my car; its perfect for me.

since, on social media and the internet, i have been getting into cars strictly for their models and how they look, but id like to be deeper than that. i would really like to make cars a hobby of mine, but everywhere i look i just see things that make me feel, well, inadequate. i am a gifted student and a fast learner, so i am very eager to jump in and learn all i can. i figured a car subreddit may be a good starting point for advice on where to look/start.

i am doing this to broaden my interests and become more relatable to my father. i appreciate and thank anyone who takes their time to respond.

thank you for reading, and for any help you may offer!! 🩷🩷",3,1754170839.0,1,CarTalk,1754230438,2025-08-02 21:40:39,2025-08-03 14:13:58,"chemistocrat (Score: 1): A suggestion: there are better car subreddits than this one if you’re interested in expanding your overall knowledge about automobiles. r/cars typically has more useful and mature discussion than r/cartalk, and r/justrolledintotheshop has probably taught me more about cars, frequent issues with them, and how to fix them than any other source outside of YouTube.

1mfxjtu,Don’t Get Burned by Subaru!,"Many of you already know about the head gasket problem with the older Subaru.

There is a new issue affecting newer and even brand new models and that is the cam carrier leak . I had my 2016 in for service and they told me my cam carrier was seeping oil. they quoted me over $4000 to fix it because it is an engine-out repair. Simply google Subaru cam carrier leak and also Mr. Subaru YouTube channel addressed this.

The issue arises because Subaru used RTV instead of a hard gasket on the seam between the cam carrier and the heads. After enough heat cycles, the RTV becomes hardened and prone to leakage/seepage. To be totally honest, I really don’t know how much of an issue this will be but the issue will come up years after the typical warranty has expired. If you are a person that buys a car to own and not to lease, this becomes a major issue.

I was the biggest Subaru fan boy there was until I learned about this, and also the fact that we went through about six pairs of rear bearings between our two 2016s Crosstreks. Yes I hope that SOA and Subaru will do the right thing and correct this issue. it is my opinion that it is unconscionable for an auto maker to manufacturer a product requiring such a expensive repair just outside of the warranty. For the record my 2016 Crosstrek only had 55,000 miles on it at the time and had gone through three rear bearings in addition to the cam carrier seepage.",42,1754159100.0,38,CarTalk,1754230438,2025-08-02 18:25:00,2025-08-03 14:13:58,"Gertrude1976 (Score: 21): I always wanted a Bugeye WRX, when the time came to buy I got a VA STi because it was newer and I had hoped it would be more reliable at only 80,000 miles.

For small chips, there is an epoxy that you can fill it with and it usually stops the chip from spreading to a Crack, but a crack like that will only get worse with temperature fluctuations.

1mfh8cb,Looking for a new/used car concerns insight. Am I overreacting?,"I’m currently driving a 2010 Nissan Rogue and it’s just about on its last legs that it’s to the point again that I need to look for a new (used probably) one. However, with how newer cars are being made I have some concerns and am looking for some insight. I love how my current car is and if I knew back then if this is how cars were going to be like, I would have taken much better care of my current car.

Concern 1:  Touchscreens

Reasons for concern 1: I have bad light sensitivity especially at night and I worry that I’m going to struggle with having a screen in my face. I already wear yellow night driving glasses & sunglasses at night to help balance out on coming LED lights. (I drive rural  almost 90% of the time and even then I struggle with those on coming lights) When I ride in someone else’s car who already has a touchscreen, it really bothers me and makes other symptoms worse for myself. I understand I can probably turn the screen brightness down but I don’t want to do that every time I drive in the day time vs the night time.

Reasons for concern 2: I get SEVERE motion sickness. It doesn’t matter how far I ride in the car, what I’m doing, where I’m looking, it could be less than a quarter mile and I’m already severely nauseous. I don’t usually get like that when I’m driving unless it’s really foggy or it’s raining really hard. I worry that having a screen in my face like that is going to cause un wanted motion sickness I can’t control. Screens = motion sickness specially in a car.

Concern 2: LED headlights  
I’m worried I’m going to get a car equipped with LED headlights and as I had mention previously, I’m light sensitive and already have difficulties with them with other drivers. Especially in rural areas (where I live). I have ridden in 2 cars (2 different drivers) who have had LED lights and each time, on top of getting motion sick, has given me really bad headaches. As I also said earlier, I wear yellow driving glasses and sunglasses when I drive at night so it might not be too much of a bother if it would also help dim my own LED headlights down. Though I can’t seem to see things on the side of the road. I have talked to my eye doctor last time I saw him a year ago and he said he can’t do anything about my light sensitivity aside from finding ways to cope and deal with it.

At this point some of you might be going: why drive at all?The answer is: I live in a rural area so driving is necessary & I can’t ride in the car for more than a minute with out having the need to throw up. I don’t do a lot of traveling anyways side from driving to work and back. How old am I? 30 . . . I sound like a really old person complaining about advances in technology. My apologies. Maybe it ended up more in a anxiety educed rant because I don't like how cars are being made these days and I'm scared-

1mfxvq1,2007 Chevy Tahoe Transmission or Electrical?,"2007 Chevy Tahoe 5.3 Automatic 

The original problem was that the Tahoe threw a code for the throttle body so we changed it out and then transmission wouldn't shift past 2nd gear even when my husband would manually shift it. Several local mechanics told us it was the transmission and we needed a new one. So we purchased one from a salvage yard 4L60E Transmission w/ torque converter and changed it out. It worked ""okay"" for about 2 weeks and than again today it wouldn't shift past 2nd gear. But the reason I ask is electrical? Because today after it started acting up the AC went out and then the radio seemed to cut out something because the dashboard went dead. None of the gauges were working we couldn't read the RPMs or the Speed. Also I need to mention the oil pressure sensor is out and we are planning on replacing that as well but we are not sure what the problem really is. Could there be something going on electrical that has caused both transmissions top gears to go out? Should we have used a new torque converter? Or is it just the transmission it's self and we got a bad one? It's under warranty still so we can always swap out another one but we want to make sure there is no underlying condition that is going to keep causing this to every transmission. 

I should add that my husband installed a new digital radio and AC from a manual AC. And the AC did go out after that but recently we discovered it was a relay that needed to be replaced so that has been replaced with a temporary fix. Could that also maybe be an issue? 

We are lost Mechanics we could really use some guidance in the right direction.

1mfuo0d,Kia Sportage 2022 AWD engine jerking and stalling,"Hello,  
I am reaching out to this sub with a help to identify a reccuring issue I have with my Sportage. (I am based in Central Europe.)

After a longer ride (45minutes+) on a highway when engine has warmed up car starts to lose rpm which starts to spastically jump up and down, car seems to also start jerking and shaking from the engine area and when comming to a near stop and then coming up back to speed it seems to be having issues similar to stalling. Vibration and shakes are felt also on the steering wheel quite heavily and the engine power is significantly lower during the issue occurence. When turning off the engine and starting it back again the issue seems to disappear only to happen once again after another tens of minutes of riding. (No indicators are showing up during any of this on the panel.) In all cases I have some video recordings of the behaviour this time and the 2nd time it happened, but that's all the proof I have, since turning off the car and starting again 'fixes the issue'. :D

It's been a 3rd time that this have happened and my previous offcial reports of this and subsequent repairs in authorised car service centre, they have returned the car where they have changed the spark plugs and coils, but other than that, they cannot replicate the issue to be 100 percent sure what's causing it. Simply not running the engine for enough long period of a time for the car to start showing this behaviour.

The first repair however seemed to be also connected to the engine central unit where ""some pins have been bent and they straigten it out on some connector"", but I have no specific proof of this other than. - 'It works now we did some cable related work and it seems to be fixed.'

Issue then happened after a half year again.. and now after the 2nd occurence 3 weeks later today.

Is there anyone who have faced the same issue or could point me to the right direction so I can mention atleast something new to the authorised service technician to check?",0,1754151847.0,1,autorepair,1754230438,2025-08-02 16:24:07,2025-08-03 14:13:58,"DiscoCamera (Score: 1): Sounds like a fuel pressure issue, not sure if high pressure or low pressure side though."

The problem started when I had to use a 12v CLA air pump. I could hear the car and pump experiencing almost like electrical drops in voltage. The air pump then died, but it had only blown the fuse.

Shortly after that after the car was running for approximately 30 minutes and was shut off, it just died. Acted like it didn’t have a battery. I disconnected the negative terminal for about 10 minutes. Reconnected it and the car had power and would start.

I had gone and picked up most of the fuses the car uses and took it home. I replaced the fuse that was blown. I checked all the other small fuses and they are all good.

The car kept randomly dying after being run. I did check the battery voltage and it was a little low. I also cleaned the terminals of the battery and the battery cables. I thought maybe it was a bad connection. Plus the car did throw a code for low battery.

I had let the battery trickle charge all night last night. I tired it again this morning. It let me unlock the doors with the fob. I got in and just as I was turning the ignition it flat out died.

1mftsbu,Advice needed: First time windshield replacement,"I found my parked car at airport with a long windshield crack, likely from hail damage. 

- I haven't had it professionally examined but from reading online, it seems this would need to be replaced? I have attached a picture. 

- My car is a 2013 Hyundai Accent HB model w/90K mileage. I have comprehensive ins. but since quotes came in less than deductible I'm going cash route. 

1. Called dealer. They don't do it but referred to a local mobile shop. Shop said for OEM part, cost would be $1600+ and insurance likely won't cover  OEM since it's > a 2 year old car. Their aftermarket cost is $310.

2. A local business w/no storefront said they can install OEM part from Fuyao for $400. Reading up on it , seems Fuyao makes both aftermarket and OEM parts so maybe it's the safer choice though I doubt I'd actually get OEM.  However, would it be tougher to have them fix things if they mess something up since they don't have a shop one can go to?

3. Another local shop w/a storefront said they can install OEE for $360. They said they get glass from different vendors. 

I'm leaning towards Option 2 since the business provided the glass supplier name and they also have the most reviews (majority +ve) so I have some  idea what I'm getting. Thoughts?  Thanks.

Then after scraping the old adhesive off he put primer down to cover any bare metal. The whole thing was a relief to see done well. 

I honestly would go with aftermarket. Funny enough this windshield we just had replaced with OEM got a chip in it three weeks after install. We got it filled but it continued to crack…got it filled again but I’m not so hopeful it will keep it from spreading again. I swear newer windshields are softer glass.

1mfsmzo,2007 Chevy Tahoe Transmission or Electrical?,"

I'm back again! First off Thank you to everyone who has replied to all my previous posts we really appreciate all of your advice. Unfortunately we are still having problems and I'm going to give you the whole story so maybe y'all can lead us in the right direction.

2007 Chevy Tahoe 5.3 Automatic 

The original problem was that the Tahoe threw a code for the throttle body so we changed it out and then transmission wouldn't shift past 2nd gear even when my husband would manually shift it. Several local mechanics told us it was the transmission and we needed a new one. So we purchased one from a salvage yard 4L60E Transmission w/ torque converter and changed it out. It worked ""okay"" for about 2 weeks and than again today it wouldn't shift past 2nd gear. But the reason I ask is electrical? Because today after it started acting up the AC went out and then the radio seemed to cut out something because the dashboard went dead. None of the gauges were working we couldn't read the RPMs or the Speed. Also I need to mention the oil pressure sensor is out and we are planning on replacing that as well but we are not sure what the problem really is. Could there be something going on electrical that has caused both transmissions top gears to go out? Should we have used a new torque converter? Or is it just the transmission it's self and we got a bad one? It's under warranty still so we can always swap out another one but we want to make sure there is no underlying condition that is going to keep causing this to every transmission. 

I should add that my husband installed a new digital radio and AC from a manual AC. And the AC did go out after that but recently we discovered it was a relay that needed to be replaced so that has been replaced with a temporary fix. Could that also maybe be an issue? 

We are lost Mechanics we could really use some guidance in the right direction.

We really appreciate it! ",1,1754146814.0,3,autorepair,1754230438,2025-08-02 15:00:14,2025-08-03 14:13:58,"zvx (Score: 1): I think autozones scan tool reads transmission codes too, could start there

1mfxo0l,Daughter's 2010 Acura MDX,"Greetings-

My daughter drives a 2010 Acura MDX w/ over 200K miles. 

She was driving home on the interstate and the car started to slow down and the battery life came on. She safely pulled over on the shoulder and we called AAA to tow the vehicle to Firestone (only place open on Sun. in our neck of the woods).

Immediately I thought Alternator, right? The AAA tow truck operator says its not the alternator. If its not that, what on earth could it be? Something in the fuel system? 

Any tips, advice, general feedback from y'all would be greatly appreciated.

S85E92 (Score: 2): This is definitely not battery or starting system related; if it was, there would be a red battery light. These lights look more like a wheel speed sensor gone bad or a transmission speed sensor. Which would most definitely shut your car off. The abs light and traction control light tells me it has something to do with one of those two things I mentioned. Good luck."

But don’t worry, you’ll be fine. But remember the gearstick is on your left.

I also know a few Americans who moved to the UK and they’re fine with RHD cars as well. 

Doubleday5000 (Score: 2): We're so close to countries that drive on the right that most of us have experience switching to the other side.

You get used to it pretty quickly. Ymmv, but the controls are the easy part for most. The pedals are in the same place and you're steering the same. So it's just changing gears with a different hand.  Think back to when you were learning. Selecting gears wasn't hard compared to clutch control etc. 

It's like getting into a car with the indicator stalks or fuel filler cap on a different side. You might mess up a few times as you get used to it, but it's not hard.

The trickier bit is learning road rules and etiquette here. Every country is different, so at least make sure you know what our road signs mean, how roundabouts work (we use them a lot and mini-roundabouts are slightly different too) etc. 

Might even be a good idea to book a driving instructor for a lesson if you're worried. They can immediately tell you what you're doing wrong."
