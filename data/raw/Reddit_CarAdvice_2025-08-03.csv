1mg51pz,Stuck in my 2018 Civic Forever,"As my car stacks on the miles, the reality that ""Ruby"", my 2018 Honda Civic Touring, isn't going to last forever becomes more and more prevalent in my mind, and with that, the dread of finding her replacement. What I'm learning is that my favorite thing about her and A MUST HAVE, in my opinion, just isn't a thing anymore. Ruby has what's called LaneWatch. It's a passenger side-mirror camera that you can live view your blindspot at any time. This is the only thing like it that I know of. Other cars with the side mirror camera are only activated when the turn signal is on. I want to see it before I signal and maybe not every time I signal. This game changing feature was replaced by a little blind spot indicator light. It feels like such a step in the wrong direction.

hi everyone! i am a 17 year old girl, and i have never really had much interest in cars throughout my life. i didnt have a male influence around that particularly cared about cars, so it never really become one of my 'things'. i was always art, music, and film, so it never even entered my mind, though i always liked how cars looked (especially mid 1900s cars).

since meeting my father, i have learned that he is really into cars. he even got me a $2200 2008 volkswagen rabbit. im in love with my car; its perfect for me.

since, on social media and the internet, i have been getting into cars strictly for their models and how they look, but id like to be deeper than that. i would really like to make cars a hobby of mine, but everywhere i look i just see things that make me feel, well, inadequate. i am a gifted student and a fast learner, so i am very eager to jump in and learn all i can. i figured a car subreddit may be a good starting point for advice on where to look/start.

i am doing this to broaden my interests and become more relatable to my father. i appreciate and thank anyone who takes their time to respond.

1mfxjtu,Don’t Get Burned by Subaru!,"Many of you already know about the head gasket problem with the older Subaru.

There is a new issue affecting newer and even brand new models and that is the cam carrier leak . I had my 2016 in for service and they told me my cam carrier was seeping oil. they quoted me over $4000 to fix it because it is an engine-out repair. Simply google Subaru cam carrier leak and also Mr. Subaru YouTube channel addressed this.

The issue arises because Subaru used RTV instead of a hard gasket on the seam between the cam carrier and the heads. After enough heat cycles, the RTV becomes hardened and prone to leakage/seepage. To be totally honest, I really don’t know how much of an issue this will be but the issue will come up years after the typical warranty has expired. If you are a person that buys a car to own and not to lease, this becomes a major issue.

I was the biggest Subaru fan boy there was until I learned about this, and also the fact that we went through about six pairs of rear bearings between our two 2016s Crosstreks. Yes I hope that SOA and Subaru will do the right thing and correct this issue. it is my opinion that it is unconscionable for an auto maker to manufacturer a product requiring such a expensive repair just outside of the warranty.

A couple days you might be OK. Weeks or months, just buy a new battery. That is because they really don't like being drawn down and left in a discharged state. They tend to develop sulfation and swelled dividers which damage the battery. Now you connect them to your good alternator and it tries to charge at maximum output into what amounts to be a dead short. That destroys the alternator and now you are buying a replacement for that plus a new battery. Then if you have a modern vehicle that has a ton of electronics, you might end up needing a dealership to get the vehicle running again.

NickRMX6 (Score: 3): You can't ""ground"" it by sticking a nail in the ground. That's not how car batteries work (the ""ground"" is not a ground in that sense, it's just that cars use the metal chassis as the negative ""wire"" to complete the circuit). What you are planning to do won't work.

But the rest of your plan is basically OK. What I would suggest: hook up both cables to the dead battery, then connect the red cable to the positive on the donor car, then connect the black cable to the chassis of the donor car. (That's just to ensure that if there is a spark when you make that last connection, it's away from both batteries, just to be extra cautious.) Then run the donor car engine for 15 or so minutes, to charge up the dead battery.

Ideally though, it would be better to take the dead battery to a parts store, to get it tested, and fully charged on a battery charger."

Check the level once it's cold, it should be above the min level. Then check the radiator. In operation the coolant will expand and push air/coolant out into the overflow. Then as it cools it pulls a vacuum and coolant flows out of the reservoir through the valve in the cap and into the radiator.  That way air is kept out of the system. If you check it and the level is like the image you might want to get a new cap and clean the neck of the radiator."

1mfh8cb,Looking for a new/used car concerns insight. Am I overreacting?,"I’m currently driving a 2010 Nissan Rogue and it’s just about on its last legs that it’s to the point again that I need to look for a new (used probably) one. However, with how newer cars are being made I have some concerns and am looking for some insight. I love how my current car is and if I knew back then if this is how cars were going to be like, I would have taken much better care of my current car.

Concern 1:  Touchscreens

Reasons for concern 1: I have bad light sensitivity especially at night and I worry that I’m going to struggle with having a screen in my face. I already wear yellow night driving glasses & sunglasses at night to help balance out on coming LED lights. (I drive rural  almost 90% of the time and even then I struggle with those on coming lights) When I ride in someone else’s car who already has a touchscreen, it really bothers me and makes other symptoms worse for myself. I understand I can probably turn the screen brightness down but I don’t want to do that every time I drive in the day time vs the night time.

Reasons for concern 2: I get SEVERE motion sickness. It doesn’t matter how far I ride in the car, what I’m doing, where I’m looking, it could be less than a quarter mile and I’m already severely nauseous. I don’t usually get like that when I’m driving unless it’s really foggy or it’s raining really hard. I worry that having a screen in my face like that is going to cause un wanted motion sickness I can’t control. Screens = motion sickness specially in a car.

Concern 2: LED headlights  
I’m worried I’m going to get a car equipped with LED headlights and as I had mention previously, I’m light sensitive and already have difficulties with them with other drivers. Especially in rural areas (where I live). I have ridden in 2 cars (2 different drivers) who have had LED lights and each time, on top of getting motion sick, has given me really bad headaches. As I also said earlier, I wear yellow driving glasses and sunglasses when I drive at night so it might not be too much of a bother if it would also help dim my own LED headlights down. Though I can’t seem to see things on the side of the road. I have talked to my eye doctor last time I saw him a year ago and he said he can’t do anything about my light sensitivity aside from finding ways to cope and deal with it.

At this point some of you might be going: why drive at all?The answer is: I live in a rural area so driving is necessary & I can’t ride in the car for more than a minute with out having the need to throw up. I don’t do a lot of traveling anyways side from driving to work and back. How old am I? 30 . . . I sound like a really old person complaining about advances in technology. My apologies. Maybe it ended up more in a anxiety educed rant because I don't like how cars are being made these days and I'm scared-

1mfxvq1,2007 Chevy Tahoe Transmission or Electrical?,"2007 Chevy Tahoe 5.3 Automatic 

The original problem was that the Tahoe threw a code for the throttle body so we changed it out and then transmission wouldn't shift past 2nd gear even when my husband would manually shift it. Several local mechanics told us it was the transmission and we needed a new one. So we purchased one from a salvage yard 4L60E Transmission w/ torque converter and changed it out. It worked ""okay"" for about 2 weeks and than again today it wouldn't shift past 2nd gear. But the reason I ask is electrical? Because today after it started acting up the AC went out and then the radio seemed to cut out something because the dashboard went dead. None of the gauges were working we couldn't read the RPMs or the Speed. Also I need to mention the oil pressure sensor is out and we are planning on replacing that as well but we are not sure what the problem really is. Could there be something going on electrical that has caused both transmissions top gears to go out? Should we have used a new torque converter? Or is it just the transmission it's self and we got a bad one? It's under warranty still so we can always swap out another one but we want to make sure there is no underlying condition that is going to keep causing this to every transmission. 

I should add that my husband installed a new digital radio and AC from a manual AC. And the AC did go out after that but recently we discovered it was a relay that needed to be replaced so that has been replaced with a temporary fix. Could that also maybe be an issue?

I am reaching out to this sub with a help to identify a reccuring issue I have with my Sportage. (I am based in Central Europe.)

After a longer ride (45minutes+) on a highway when engine has warmed up car starts to lose rpm which starts to spastically jump up and down, car seems to also start jerking and shaking from the engine area and when comming to a near stop and then coming up back to speed it seems to be having issues similar to stalling. Vibration and shakes are felt also on the steering wheel quite heavily and the engine power is significantly lower during the issue occurence. When turning off the engine and starting it back again the issue seems to disappear only to happen once again after another tens of minutes of riding. (No indicators are showing up during any of this on the panel.) In all cases I have some video recordings of the behaviour this time and the 2nd time it happened, but that's all the proof I have, since turning off the car and starting again 'fixes the issue'. :D

It's been a 3rd time that this have happened and my previous offcial reports of this and subsequent repairs in authorised car service centre, they have returned the car where they have changed the spark plugs and coils, but other than that, they cannot replicate the issue to be 100 percent sure what's causing it. Simply not running the engine for enough long period of a time for the car to start showing this behaviour.

The first repair however seemed to be also connected to the engine central unit where ""some pins have been bent and they straigten it out on some connector"", but I have no specific proof of this other than. - 'It works now we did some cable related work and it seems to be fixed.'

Issue then happened after a half year again.. and now after the 2nd occurence 3 weeks later today.

The problem started when I had to use a 12v CLA air pump. I could hear the car and pump experiencing almost like electrical drops in voltage. The air pump then died, but it had only blown the fuse.

Shortly after that after the car was running for approximately 30 minutes and was shut off, it just died. Acted like it didn’t have a battery. I disconnected the negative terminal for about 10 minutes. Reconnected it and the car had power and would start.

I had gone and picked up most of the fuses the car uses and took it home. I replaced the fuse that was blown. I checked all the other small fuses and they are all good.

The car kept randomly dying after being run. I did check the battery voltage and it was a little low. I also cleaned the terminals of the battery and the battery cables. I thought maybe it was a bad connection. Plus the car did throw a code for low battery.

I had let the battery trickle charge all night last night. I tired it again this morning. It let me unlock the doors with the fob. I got in and just as I was turning the ignition it flat out died.

1mftsbu,Advice needed: First time windshield replacement,"I found my parked car at airport with a long windshield crack, likely from hail damage.

- My car is a 2013 Hyundai Accent HB model w/90K mileage. I have comprehensive ins. but since quotes came in less than deductible I'm going cash route. 

1. Called dealer. They don't do it but referred to a local mobile shop. Shop said for OEM part, cost would be $1600+ and insurance likely won't cover  OEM since it's > a 2 year old car. Their aftermarket cost is $310.

2. A local business w/no storefront said they can install OEM part from Fuyao for $400. Reading up on it , seems Fuyao makes both aftermarket and OEM parts so maybe it's the safer choice though I doubt I'd actually get OEM.  However, would it be tougher to have them fix things if they mess something up since they don't have a shop one can go to?

3. Another local shop w/a storefront said they can install OEE for $360. They said they get glass from different vendors. 

I'm leaning towards Option 2 since the business provided the glass supplier name and they also have the most reviews (majority +ve) so I have some  idea what I'm getting. Thoughts?  Thanks.

Then after scraping the old adhesive off he put primer down to cover any bare metal. The whole thing was a relief to see done well. 

I honestly would go with aftermarket. Funny enough this windshield we just had replaced with OEM got a chip in it three weeks after install.

1mfsmzo,2007 Chevy Tahoe Transmission or Electrical?,"

I'm back again! First off Thank you to everyone who has replied to all my previous posts we really appreciate all of your advice. Unfortunately we are still having problems and I'm going to give you the whole story so maybe y'all can lead us in the right direction.

2007 Chevy Tahoe 5.3 Automatic 

The original problem was that the Tahoe threw a code for the throttle body so we changed it out and then transmission wouldn't shift past 2nd gear even when my husband would manually shift it. Several local mechanics told us it was the transmission and we needed a new one. So we purchased one from a salvage yard 4L60E Transmission w/ torque converter and changed it out. It worked ""okay"" for about 2 weeks and than again today it wouldn't shift past 2nd gear. But the reason I ask is electrical? Because today after it started acting up the AC went out and then the radio seemed to cut out something because the dashboard went dead. None of the gauges were working we couldn't read the RPMs or the Speed. Also I need to mention the oil pressure sensor is out and we are planning on replacing that as well but we are not sure what the problem really is. Could there be something going on electrical that has caused both transmissions top gears to go out? Should we have used a new torque converter? Or is it just the transmission it's self and we got a bad one? It's under warranty still so we can always swap out another one but we want to make sure there is no underlying condition that is going to keep causing this to every transmission. 

I should add that my husband installed a new digital radio and AC from a manual AC. And the AC did go out after that but recently we discovered it was a relay that needed to be replaced so that has been replaced with a temporary fix. Could that also maybe be an issue? 

We are lost Mechanics we could really use some guidance in the right direction.

Either way, the ring also is marked from the factory with a tiny dot or  – mark. This signifies the orientation of the ring that should be vertical on the Piston AKA face towards the top of the Piston.  I would check your ring and make sure you have it installed correctly.  




Also all 2-stroke rings no matter if they're new or used in a new or used cylinder need to be gapped.  You can Gap it with a small file and feeler gauges. "

The dealer told me timing chains and belts are covered by the RAC extended warranty. Which put my mind at ease, so I've opted to take  out the warranty and have put a non refundable £250 deposit on the car. I pick it up on Thursday.

On the terms of the warranty it states that cars must have been serviced in line with manufacturers recommendations, which I think is every 12k miles or year. However, the car only has partial service history, it missed 2 years of services over lockdown. So I guess this means that the warranty would be void from the outset, or does it mean that from now on it has to be serviced every 12k miles/year? Also after reading some of the posts on here about extended warranties I'd be shocked if the timing belt was actually covered. It's making me a little nervous about getting the car seen as it has the potential for such a catastrophic failure.

ProfessionBoring6982 (Score: 5): What a nice thing you’re doing. My basic advice would be: Any vehicle you like the look of, go on a car checker website and type in the registration. This will give you a basic history of the car (MOT pass rate etc and details of advisories). 

Then if the car looks good from that PoV I would pay for a full report to make sure it’s not had an accidents etc (cost is nominal and 100% worth for the peace of mind).

Finally, you then what to google search what the car’s common issues are (if they are cheap to repair and cross check against the car you would like to buy, I.e. has XYZ been changed on the car already therefore negating my GF having to pay to do it at a later date) and then finally a quick check of the engine generally to see whether it is fairly robust and bullet proof.

Unfortunately I don’t have the energy to do the above for you on that specific vehicle (been a long day, otherwise I’d save you the hassle) but that’s what I tend to do.

And then finally when you turn up to buy the car check that all the gaps between the doors align, that no plastic trims within the engine bay or interior are missing or misaligned (sign of potentially a big repair being undertaken in the past and possible bodge job). Test drive at low and high speed and work your way through the gears methodically to ensure there’s no issues. Drive with the windows up and down to listen for rattles, whines or knocking. Tyre condition and brakes are also a small cost but add up if there’s a full set required so you want a decent tread and amount left on the brake discs.

Oh and insurance, just ensure it’s going to be cheap enough for your GF to be able to insurance by herself (you won’t have any issues with the car you have found).

Best of luck with you search, I hope you find a great car and that your GF appreciates it.

It's a 1.0L engine so cheap on the road tax and you can get in 3 or 5 door. If opt for the 5 just because it's a bit more practical, but the 3 door looks a bit nicer. 

The engine is also very simple, nothing fancy to it and there are/were plenty of them on the road so any mechanic should be able to relatively cheap and simple repair if you do get any issues.

Very reliable cars, just keep up the maintenance on them as per the schedule and they should serve your well for the long term. Lots of taxis are on the road with these cars and even with high mileage and even lots of DC Rapid charges they are holding up well with minimal battery degradation too.

Avoid the 'Polar White' Ioniq paint and 'Dive in Jeju' Kona paint if you can though. These are the two free paint options and are a cheap thin layer and are sometimes prone to peeling. The other paint colours are absolutely fine however. 

The Nissan LEAF is also fantastic value for money, but will have less resale value due to the battery degradation and use of the older outdated Chademo rapid charge standard.
