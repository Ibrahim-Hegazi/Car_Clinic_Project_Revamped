1mg3xac,Need Advice,"This is a long story but I want input from others that may have gone through the same thing we went through..

We have had a 2017 Kia Sorento bought with 5k miles pre owned certified from a Kia dealership…

About 7 or 8 months ago when doing a service for a recall at Kia they called me saying the car had no oil… I thought impossible as the car wasn’t even due for its oil change and isn’t even leaking oil..

Looked at it in person sure enough at the very bottom on the dipstick not completely out but this is where the fun begins

I found out that these engines are common to have a oil consumption issue watched it over the course of the next few weeks and the problem continued at this point it’s worth noting the car is about 70k miles

One day I remember Kia having a 100k mile warranty on power train for the Kia sorento so I call a dealership not the one we purchased from only for them to tell me they wouldn’t be able to help us since that warranty isn’t transferrable to a pre owned certified buy even if it only has 5k miles…. But she says to contact Kia consumer services as they may be able to help

So that’s what we do we call and tell them everything and your surprise she says yes they will help us and will have to perform an oil consumption test at the dealership to go in with the approval papers from Kia and all the records of oil changes etc so that’s what we do

Time in between getting papers and everything to start the test we near 76k miles they make us go thru months of tests not bringing it in too soon or too many miles in between about 1k mile tests a total of 3 times once the 3rd test approves it’s burning about 1.8-2 qts of oil every 1k miles…. Which is insane they tell me yep no problem we will see when we can get you in for an engine replacement we just have to verify some things and will call you on a Tuesday of next week… great sounds awesome I keep oil with me now knowing the condition so I notice it’s getting low so I go to add it before a road trip of a few hundred miles for some work..

Drive halfway to our destination it drives great feels good no worries about 50 miles in the next morning all of a sudden with no warning or lights to go off our engine sputters loss of power so I find the nearest exit look at my temp gauge it’s in the middle pull over to check oil and I have full oil still.. check engine light had flashed and oil pressure light had came on also before turning it off and won’t start back up now…

At this point I’m confused what could have happened but in the back of my mind no worries glad we got all of Kia’s tests out of the way so I can be treated as the valued customer I am right??

Well we bring it on a tow truck home check spark plugs they’re gone check compression 30 in one cylinder 0 I repeat 0 in the second and like 40 and 30 in the others….

Crankshaft does move as I pushed it down thinking the famous bearing could’ve went out once I realized the state of the engine I wanted to call Kia and see where they were being that it broke down on the day they were supposed to call anyway…

I call and I get a lovely receptionist telling me that they’re very sorry but they made a mistake and they are unfortunately unable to honor the warranty as it does not extend to the certified pre owned vehicle we have……..

ARE YOU KIDDING ME… could you not have told me the truth from the start? I could have at the very least sold it as is to get some of my money back rather than doing all your tests just for you to tell me it was all for nothing and to make matters worse I now do not have a vehicle…

1mg3h54,How do I go about repairing this?,"Year: 2016
Make: Toyota
Model: Tundra SR5 4.6L

While wiring up a new interior light, I accidentally blew a fuse. I opened the hood, found the 7.5A fuse labeled “DOME,” and swapped it out with a spare. Interior lights came back on, but the new fuse wouldn’t seat flush.

I pulled it out and realized the new fuse had longer metal prongs. I figured the old fuse’s prongs had broken off and were stuck in the fuse box, so I disconnected the battery and spent about 30 minutes trying to pry them out.

Then I pulled the fuse directly above the DOME fuse and realized… I’m an idiot — I used a standard 7.5A fuse instead of a low-profile one.

Now, after forcing and digging around, the correct fuse doesn’t work anymore. I think I may have damaged or broken the metal tab inside the fuse slot (see 3rd pic).

Can anyone confirm if that tab looks broken? And if so, can I replace just that section (pic 2), or is it part of a larger assembly? I’ve searched online but can’t figure out what part to even look for.

It can be quite a task even for someone experienced, so I'm not recommending this approach as it could potentially go wrong, and then you will be without a vehicle that runs. Occasionally, the fuse boxes are glued together, and therefore impossible to disassemble cleanly. Other times, it's a more straightforward but time-consuming procedure"

1mg2ohd,"Engine oil, coolant & break fluid - 2023 Yaris Hybrid (UK)","Hi,

This is my first car, and I really want to make sure I'm taking good care of it—but I’ll be honest, I’m pretty clueless! That said, I’m trying my best to learn.

I’ve checked the oil, brake fluid, and coolant levels. Everything looks okay, but the engine oil is sitting just above the minimum line. I assume I need to top it up as soon as possible?

I've started looking for engine oil, but I’m not sure what type I need. I tried checking the manual and Googling, and I've come across sites where you can enter your registration number to find compatible products—but they’re quite expensive, and I’m not sure what exactly makes them suitable, which makes it hard to find a more affordable alternative.

While I’m buying oil, I figured I should also pick up some coolant and brake fluid so I’m ready when those need topping up too. I assume these are things you can maintain yourself?

The manual recommends ""Toyota Super LongLife Coolant,"" and I think this is the right one:  
[Toyota Pink Pre-Mixed Coolant – 1L](https://toyotadirectparts.co.uk/parts/toyota-hilux/toyota-hilux-mk-8/hilux-mk-8-engine-service-kits/toyota-pink-pre-mixed-coolant-antifreeze-1-litre/)  
Can you confirm if that's correct?

As for brake fluid, I can’t seem to find any specific information in the manual. Is brake fluid generally universal, or is there something specific I should be looking for?

**Quick note:** My car is still under warranty, and I have a Toyota service plan that includes one service and MOT per year. I’ve only had the car for 3–4 weeks. Should I be going through the service plan for this kind of thing?

The sound speeds up or slows down with speed.  No sound when driving straight or turning left.  If I brake when turning right the sound goes away even though wheels are still moving.  If drive while turning right (with one foot on the gas and another lightly on the brake), there is no sound even though I'm traveling at a similar speed as my other tests.  If I drive turning to the right and then shift into neutral, the sound continues (although it slows as the wheels slow). Things I have tried:

1. Jacked the front wheels up, blocked the back wheels and had someone put the car in drive.  Wheels turned but no noise regardless of the steering wheel position.

2. Put hands at 3 and 9 on the wheel and tried to move side to side but no significant play.  Same with hands at 6 and 12.

3. Inspected the boots on CV joints and tie rods and could not find any damage and could not find any grease signifying other damage.

When the car was jacked up, I noticed the sway bar link on driver's side has a little play and the boot seemed to have a little grease on the outside so i will replace both front sway bar links BUT my noise while turning doesn't seem consistent with a sway bar link issue because it goes away when i brake even though the car is still cornering at a similar speed.

Never had any issues with my car, just regular maintenance, repairs, and replacements. Never had any weird noises coming from my car either until this year. The right A/C vent on the passenger side started making this buzzing/vibration noise on June 14th of this year when I was driving on a highway. You may have to turn volume up close to all the way to hear it in this video, it sounds louder in person. I had been driving for a while on the highway that day, and all of a sudden it started out of nowhere. The noise can be heard faintly when I hit a speed of about 45mph, but when going 70mph on the highway/the faster I go, the noise is constant and much louder. Any slower than 45mph and it doesn’t make a noise at all. I have checked my cabin air filter, blew out the filter and the area in the car where the filter goes with compressed air, and checked around the windows and windshield wipers to make sure it was nothing flapping outside because I’ve had a rubber piece come loose outside the car and it caused a similar noise but this buzzing noise seems to be something coming from inside with the airflow vents like there is something flapping or being moved around by air and vibration when I get up in speed.  I’ve also checked to make sure the mesh speaker covers and other things weren’t loose and vibrating around, but I’m positive the noise only comes from the passenger side and definitely seems to be coming from the vent.

1mfz6yy,Should I Follow my Mechanic's Advice?,"My 2016 Honda Odyssey has been having the ""Christmas Tree"" light effect where all the lights on the dashboard go on, check engine light, FCW, etc. My mechanic said it was a problem with the 3rd cylinder, likely because of the ECO system. I added a VCM tuner II and it seemed to work. However, now the check engine light came on again, and this time it's the 6th cylinder. My mechanic changed all the spark plugs and the coil for the 6th. But the check engine light went back on and gave a 6th cylinder error reading. ""P0306"" I believe.

Coincidentally, I received a letter in the mail this week from Honda extending the warranty to 10 years or 150k mi (whichever is first), related to piston rings failing due to the ECO mode in cylinders 1-4. My mechanic's recommendation was to take the VCM tuner II out, drive the car until the 3rd cylinder fails, which it has multiple times previously, and then take it to Honda for a warranty claim. The letter Honda sent me said it'd take them 10.5 hrs to do the repair. So my mechanic equates that to replacing the engine rather than replacing the piston rings given the estimated timeframe for the repair.

Do you think this is a good idea? Drive the car hoping the 3rd cylinder throws an error (which it has done repeatedly before). Then take it to the Honda dealership to make a claim on the warranty? Do you agree with my mechanic's assessment? FWIW, he seems like a pretty sharp guy.

Or should I sell the car in its current state, with the cylinder error code?

But yea if you have a bank 1 misfire and an oil fouled plug, it should be covered. I'd just make sure you don't have non original equipment plus like Bosch or autolite in it, ngk or denso brand.

 Ignoring a broken control arm and stabilizers could lead to really bad scenerios. The suspension will constantly vibrate along with steering wandering meaning it feels loose. Worst of this could literally lead to your tie rod snaping. 

If a tie rod breaks you will lose control of your steering. Tie rods are connected to the wheels and part of the steering rack that allows you to turn your wheels. If a tie rod snaps you lose steering completely on that wheel. Meaning you could be turning right on the other wheel and the wheel with the broken tie rod could be literally turning left. That wheel would literally turn in any direction on its own. At high speeds it could mean death. Never minimize suspension.

After replacing these parts if you do it on your own you would need an alignment. There is no way around needing an alignment if you want your wheels to be complelety straight. You can get it close on your own but getting it properly aligned without alignment tools is highly improbable."

Once most of the grease is gone, then water and dirt start wearing away the CV joint.  It does take a while before it fails, but it's never a good time if it fails on the road.  If it was mine, I would go ahead and replace the axle.

So you have a few options here.  

1. Replace the axle assembly with a new Toyota/Lexus axle or an aftermarket.  This will be the most expensive way to go.

2. Pull the axle, disassemble the CV joint, clean it, install a new boot with new grease and clamps and reinstall.  This will likely be the least expensive way, but time consuming and messy.

3. Install a split boot.  Search ""Split Boot – Universal Fit CV Boot Kit"" and you'll find the kits.  You can install these on the car, without remove anything but the old boot and clamps.  The boot is split then glued together when it's in place.  I have no personal experience with them.  Some say they work great, others say they're a waste of money.  Cost wise it's around the price of a new boot kit or a little higher

And yes, it's possible to do it without an impact wrench.  I've done it both ways but I'd rather have an impact.  Either way I manually tighten the nut when reassembling.  You don't want to ruin the hub bearings.  I have a 3/4"" drive breaker bar and large socket for it.  I've seen a lot of broken 1/2"" bars as a result of trying to remove an axle nut.

Would the muffler be free after that?  To put it back together does it just bolt together?  No welding or anything?  Anything like a seal that goes between them?

It is arguably easier to check your right side blind spot than it is the left, so if you only gonna give me a blindspot monitor on one side, why make it the right?

And to add, the radar blind spot monitoring systems light up the warning light at any time there is something in your blind spot when the vehicle is in motion, and light begins to flash or change color, or add an audio warning (depending on brand of course) once you engage a turn signal.

i am doing this to broaden my interests and become more relatable to my father. i appreciate and thank anyone who takes their time to respond.

thank you for reading, and for any help you may offer!! 🩷🩷",3,1754170839.0,1,CarTalk,1754249632,2025-08-02 21:40:39,2025-08-03 19:33:52,"chemistocrat (Score: 1): A suggestion: there are better car subreddits than this one if you’re interested in expanding your overall knowledge about automobiles. r/cars typically has more useful and mature discussion than r/cartalk, and r/justrolledintotheshop has probably taught me more about cars, frequent issues with them, and how to fix them than any other source outside of YouTube.

1mfxjtu,Don’t Get Burned by Subaru!,"Many of you already know about the head gasket problem with the older Subaru.

There is a new issue affecting newer and even brand new models and that is the cam carrier leak . I had my 2016 in for service and they told me my cam carrier was seeping oil. they quoted me over $4000 to fix it because it is an engine-out repair. Simply google Subaru cam carrier leak and also Mr. Subaru YouTube channel addressed this.

The issue arises because Subaru used RTV instead of a hard gasket on the seam between the cam carrier and the heads. After enough heat cycles, the RTV becomes hardened and prone to leakage/seepage. To be totally honest, I really don’t know how much of an issue this will be but the issue will come up years after the typical warranty has expired. If you are a person that buys a car to own and not to lease, this becomes a major issue.

I was the biggest Subaru fan boy there was until I learned about this, and also the fact that we went through about six pairs of rear bearings between our two 2016s Crosstreks. Yes I hope that SOA and Subaru will do the right thing and correct this issue. it is my opinion that it is unconscionable for an auto maker to manufacturer a product requiring such a expensive repair just outside of the warranty.

They tend to develop sulfation and swelled dividers which damage the battery. Now you connect them to your good alternator and it tries to charge at maximum output into what amounts to be a dead short. That destroys the alternator and now you are buying a replacement for that plus a new battery.

But the rest of your plan is basically OK. What I would suggest: hook up both cables to the dead battery, then connect the red cable to the positive on the donor car, then connect the black cable to the chassis of the donor car. (That's just to ensure that if there is a spark when you make that last connection, it's away from both batteries, just to be extra cautious.) Then run the donor car engine for 15 or so minutes, to charge up the dead battery.

Ideally though, it would be better to take the dead battery to a parts store, to get it tested, and fully charged on a battery charger."

I’m in Florida, so my question is simple - do cops actually pull you over and harass you in your experience for dark window tint? I’ve previously had a 2023 Audi A4 and I had 15% in the back and 20% in the front and every time I’ve been pulled over by a cop, whether it was a Florida state trooper or my local PD (Jupiter, FL in Palm Beach County) they’ve never once been harassed let alone mentioned anything about my window tint. I just think if I go 5% this time it may attract cops.

Should I do the 5% all around or the 5% back and 15% front to play it safe? 


EDIT: I’m aware that in the state of Florida the legal limit for tint is 15% in the back and 28% in the front. It’s just never been an issue in the past and I was wondering if going darker would start causing issues.

	1.	Check if the TIPM was properly programmed to your VIN
If not, it may not communicate correctly with the starter or other modules.
	2.	Test for starter signal at the solenoid
Use a multimeter or test light on the small wire at the starter while someone turns the key. If no signal, TIPM isn’t sending it.
	3.	Manually jump the starter
With ignition ON, carefully jump the starter solenoid. If it cranks, the starter is likely fine — issue is upstream (TIPM or wiring).
	4.	Inspect grounds and TIPM connectors
Double-check that all ground cables are clean, tight, and reconnected. Reseat TIPM plugs to ensure solid connection.
	5.	Scan for codes (including TIPM/BCM)
Use a scanner that can read beyond basic OBD2 — check TIPM, PCM, and BCM for communication or immobilizer faults.

Check the level once it's cold, it should be above the min level. Then check the radiator. In operation the coolant will expand and push air/coolant out into the overflow. Then as it cools it pulls a vacuum and coolant flows out of the reservoir through the valve in the cap and into the radiator.  That way air is kept out of the system. If you check it and the level is like the image you might want to get a new cap and clean the neck of the radiator."

However, with how newer cars are being made I have some concerns and am looking for some insight. I love how my current car is and if I knew back then if this is how cars were going to be like, I would have taken much better care of my current car.

Concern 1:  Touchscreens

Reasons for concern 1: I have bad light sensitivity especially at night and I worry that I’m going to struggle with having a screen in my face. I already wear yellow night driving glasses & sunglasses at night to help balance out on coming LED lights. (I drive rural  almost 90% of the time and even then I struggle with those on coming lights) When I ride in someone else’s car who already has a touchscreen, it really bothers me and makes other symptoms worse for myself. I understand I can probably turn the screen brightness down but I don’t want to do that every time I drive in the day time vs the night time.

Reasons for concern 2: I get SEVERE motion sickness. It doesn’t matter how far I ride in the car, what I’m doing, where I’m looking, it could be less than a quarter mile and I’m already severely nauseous. I don’t usually get like that when I’m driving unless it’s really foggy or it’s raining really hard. I worry that having a screen in my face like that is going to cause un wanted motion sickness I can’t control. Screens = motion sickness specially in a car.

Concern 2: LED headlights  
I’m worried I’m going to get a car equipped with LED headlights and as I had mention previously, I’m light sensitive and already have difficulties with them with other drivers. Especially in rural areas (where I live). I have ridden in 2 cars (2 different drivers) who have had LED lights and each time, on top of getting motion sick, has given me really bad headaches. As I also said earlier, I wear yellow driving glasses and sunglasses when I drive at night so it might not be too much of a bother if it would also help dim my own LED headlights down. Though I can’t seem to see things on the side of the road. I have talked to my eye doctor last time I saw him a year ago and he said he can’t do anything about my light sensitivity aside from finding ways to cope and deal with it.

At this point some of you might be going: why drive at all?The answer is: I live in a rural area so driving is necessary & I can’t ride in the car for more than a minute with out having the need to throw up. I don’t do a lot of traveling anyways side from driving to work and back. How old am I? 30 . . . I sound like a really old person complaining about advances in technology. My apologies. Maybe it ended up more in a anxiety educed rant because I don't like how cars are being made these days and I'm scared-

1mfxvq1,2007 Chevy Tahoe Transmission or Electrical?,"2007 Chevy Tahoe 5.3 Automatic 

The original problem was that the Tahoe threw a code for the throttle body so we changed it out and then transmission wouldn't shift past 2nd gear even when my husband would manually shift it. Several local mechanics told us it was the transmission and we needed a new one. So we purchased one from a salvage yard 4L60E Transmission w/ torque converter and changed it out. It worked ""okay"" for about 2 weeks and than again today it wouldn't shift past 2nd gear. But the reason I ask is electrical? Because today after it started acting up the AC went out and then the radio seemed to cut out something because the dashboard went dead. None of the gauges were working we couldn't read the RPMs or the Speed. Also I need to mention the oil pressure sensor is out and we are planning on replacing that as well but we are not sure what the problem really is. Could there be something going on electrical that has caused both transmissions top gears to go out? Should we have used a new torque converter? Or is it just the transmission it's self and we got a bad one? It's under warranty still so we can always swap out another one but we want to make sure there is no underlying condition that is going to keep causing this to every transmission. 

I should add that my husband installed a new digital radio and AC from a manual AC. And the AC did go out after that but recently we discovered it was a relay that needed to be replaced so that has been replaced with a temporary fix. Could that also maybe be an issue?

Vibration and shakes are felt also on the steering wheel quite heavily and the engine power is significantly lower during the issue occurence.

It's been a 3rd time that this have happened and my previous offcial reports of this and subsequent repairs in authorised car service centre, they have returned the car where they have changed the spark plugs and coils, but other than that, they cannot replicate the issue to be 100 percent sure what's causing it. Simply not running the engine for enough long period of a time for the car to start showing this behaviour.

The first repair however seemed to be also connected to the engine central unit where ""some pins have been bent and they straigten it out on some connector"", but I have no specific proof of this other than. - 'It works now we did some cable related work and it seems to be fixed.'

1. Called dealer. They don't do it but referred to a local mobile shop. Shop said for OEM part, cost would be $1600+ and insurance likely won't cover  OEM since it's > a 2 year old car. Their aftermarket cost is $310.

2. A local business w/no storefront said they can install OEM part from Fuyao for $400. Reading up on it , seems Fuyao makes both aftermarket and OEM parts so maybe it's the safer choice though I doubt I'd actually get OEM.  However, would it be tougher to have them fix things if they mess something up since they don't have a shop one can go to?

3. Another local shop w/a storefront said they can install OEE for $360. They said they get glass from different vendors. 

I'm leaning towards Option 2 since the business provided the glass supplier name and they also have the most reviews (majority +ve) so I have some  idea what I'm getting. Thoughts?  Thanks.

The guy I just had replace our windshield was top notch. He used the wire thing…no idea the name but it suctions on the inside and you attach a drill to it and it gently cuts the adhesive. Then after scraping the old adhesive off he put primer down to cover any bare metal. The whole thing was a relief to see done well. 

I honestly would go with aftermarket. Funny enough this windshield we just had replaced with OEM got a chip in it three weeks after install. We got it filled but it continued to crack…got it filled again but I’m not so hopeful it will keep it from spreading again. I swear newer windshields are softer glass. 

With all that said, give aftermarket a shot.

No_Water_4109 (Score: 2): Depending on the vehicle, if it has any kind of forward pointing sensors/camera (usually mounted in or above the rear view mirror), those sensors require recalibration after windshield replacement.

Recalibration requires special equipment. Check that your chosen repair company has the equipment and was trained and certified for its use on your car make & model.

Otherwise, the cars features like crash avoidance may not work properly. You may not be aware until after you depend on it, and it fails to work as it should."
1mfsmzo,2007 Chevy Tahoe Transmission or Electrical?,"

I'm back again! First off Thank you to everyone who has replied to all my previous posts we really appreciate all of your advice. Unfortunately we are still having problems and I'm going to give you the whole story so maybe y'all can lead us in the right direction.

2007 Chevy Tahoe 5.3 Automatic 

The original problem was that the Tahoe threw a code for the throttle body so we changed it out and then transmission wouldn't shift past 2nd gear even when my husband would manually shift it. Several local mechanics told us it was the transmission and we needed a new one. So we purchased one from a salvage yard 4L60E Transmission w/ torque converter and changed it out. It worked ""okay"" for about 2 weeks and than again today it wouldn't shift past 2nd gear. But the reason I ask is electrical? Because today after it started acting up the AC went out and then the radio seemed to cut out something because the dashboard went dead. None of the gauges were working we couldn't read the RPMs or the Speed. Also I need to mention the oil pressure sensor is out and we are planning on replacing that as well but we are not sure what the problem really is. Could there be something going on electrical that has caused both transmissions top gears to go out? Should we have used a new torque converter? Or is it just the transmission it's self and we got a bad one? It's under warranty still so we can always swap out another one but we want to make sure there is no underlying condition that is going to keep causing this to every transmission. 

I should add that my husband installed a new digital radio and AC from a manual AC. And the AC did go out after that but recently we discovered it was a relay that needed to be replaced so that has been replaced with a temporary fix. Could that also maybe be an issue? 

We are lost Mechanics we could really use some guidance in the right direction.

We really appreciate it! ",1,1754146814.0,3,autorepair,1754249632,2025-08-02 15:00:14,2025-08-03 19:33:52,"zvx (Score: 1): I think autozones scan tool reads transmission codes too, could start there

On mopeds and scooters and really any two strokes many Pistons will have this little locating pin to keep the rings from aligning their gaps and creating a blow-by situation where the engine will not run or run poorly. 


There's essentially two different designs of this ring type.  One is as you see here where the notch is on the horizontal face.  The other style that notch is below the face of the ring so that the ring itself covers the entire pin when compressed in the land. 


Either way, the ring also is marked from the factory with a tiny dot or  – mark. This signifies the orientation of the ring that should be vertical on the Piston AKA face towards the top of the Piston.  I would check your ring and make sure you have it installed correctly.

1mfwa5p,Do these scratches justify a full repaint of both sides of a van? Rental company wants to charge me €1300 for it.,"Hi everyone,

I recently returned a rented Volkswagen LT31 camper van in Portugal. The company now claims I caused scratches on both sides and wants to charge me €1300 for a full repaint of both left and right side panels, plus immobilization time.

Attached are comparison photos they provided (""before"" and ""after""). In my opinion, these are only minor surface scratches, possibly polishable.

Would really appreciate professional or experienced opinions:

\- Do you think this level of damage requires full repainting?

\- Could this be resolved with just polishing?

\- What would be a fair repair cost?

This is my first car, and I really want to make sure I'm taking good care of it—but I’ll be honest, I’m pretty clueless! That said, I’m trying my best to learn.

I’ve checked the oil, brake fluid, and coolant levels. Everything looks okay, but the engine oil is sitting just above the minimum line. I assume I need to top it up as soon as possible?

I've started looking for engine oil, but I’m not sure what type I need. I tried checking the manual and Googling, and I've come across sites where you can enter your registration number to find compatible products—but they’re quite expensive, and I’m not sure what exactly makes them suitable, which makes it hard to find a more affordable alternative.

While I’m buying oil, I figured I should also pick up some coolant and brake fluid so I’m ready when those need topping up too. I assume these are things you can maintain yourself?

The manual recommends ""Toyota Super LongLife Coolant,"" and I think this is the right one:  
[Toyota Pink Pre-Mixed Coolant – 1L](https://toyotadirectparts.co.uk/parts/toyota-hilux/toyota-hilux-mk-8/hilux-mk-8-engine-service-kits/toyota-pink-pre-mixed-coolant-antifreeze-1-litre/)  
Can you confirm if that's correct?

As for brake fluid, I can’t seem to find any specific information in the manual. Is brake fluid generally universal, or is there something specific I should be looking for?

**Quick note:** My car is still under warranty, and I have a Toyota service plan that includes one service and MOT per year. I’ve only had the car for 3–4 weeks. Should I be going through the service plan for this kind of thing?

I personally replaced the thermostat on my 2003 Highlander (148,000 Miles, Automatic). The CEC light went off on its own after about 200 miles. While doing this replacement I had to pull various wiring clips, air box, air hoses, and the coolant hose. As far as I know everything went on good and is still that way. I did spill coolant while pulling the coolant hose. I refilled with a full 5qt bottle.

About a week after the replacement, while climbing a mountain pass going \~65 MPH, I heard a bit of a light rattling, or otherwise a new sound coming from the engine. The code didn't come on immediately, but eventually the CEL came on with a P0325 and P0330 Code for the knock sensor bank 1 and 2 respectively. I cleared all the codes, including the stored codes from thermostat, and air sensors. Shortly after the P0325 and 330 came on again.

I took out the air box again and checked all the wiring harnesses, everything seemed to be hooked up well, nothing was visibly damaged. I cleared the code again, and it remained off for \~15 miles before it came one again. All other codes have remained off.

As it is now, I don't hear the odd engine noise, *however*, acceleration uphill is very sluggish, and I can be going 50mph, and floor it and the acceleration and RPM increase is VERY slow. The on-board computer calculating mileage has not decreased since this, and I have put probably 400 miles on it. The car doesn't appear to be leaking coolant, though the reservoir does look low. The thermometer hasn't shown its over heating at all.

The correlation with the thermostat replacement is suspicious, so it raises some questions. I am curious if anyone has dealt with this or for your input on these:

\-If an air hose or non-knock-sensor wiring isn't hooked up properly could that cause the engine knock sensor to give a code?  
\-Could the spilled coolant have caused an electrical short?  
\-Could there be a different problem in the coolant system?  
\-Should I replace the sensors only or all the wiring and the sensors too?  
\-Advice on avoiding driving, or avoiding driving a certain way until I can get this fixed?

Im guessing I need to take the thing apart and replace the sensors and harness as they are likely damaged somewhere in there. before I do that, just looking for input, since that seems like a pretty big task.

Is it running hot?  That jug of coolant you put in, was it concentrate or 50/50.  I wonder if something went awry during thermostat replacement.  Replacement is bad, coolant is gelling, transposed heater hoses, there’s still a lot of air in it, or something else like debris between the condenser and radiator.

1mfxyz5,2007 Chevy Tahoe Transmission or Electrical?,"2007 Chevy Tahoe 5.3 Automatic 

The original problem was that the Tahoe threw a code for the throttle body so we changed it out and then transmission wouldn't shift past 2nd gear even when my husband would manually shift it. Several local mechanics told us it was the transmission and we needed a new one. So we purchased one from a salvage yard 4L60E Transmission w/ torque converter and changed it out. It worked ""okay"" for about 2 weeks and than again today it wouldn't shift past 2nd gear. But the reason I ask is electrical? Because today after it started acting up the AC went out and then the radio seemed to cut out something because the dashboard went dead. None of the gauges were working we couldn't read the RPMs or the Speed. Also I need to mention the oil pressure sensor is out and we are planning on replacing that as well but we are not sure what the problem really is. Could there be something going on electrical that has caused both transmissions top gears to go out? Should we have used a new torque converter? Or is it just the transmission it's self and we got a bad one? It's under warranty still so we can always swap out another one but we want to make sure there is no underlying condition that is going to keep causing this to every transmission. 

I should add that my husband installed a new digital radio and AC from a manual AC. And the AC did go out after that but recently we discovered it was a relay that needed to be replaced so that has been replaced with a temporary fix. Could that also maybe be an issue? 

We are lost Mechanics we could really use some guidance in the right direction.

1mfxg82,Normal for voltage when in gear to fall below 12.4v?,"2018 Honda CRV-LX  80,000km. CVT.  1.5L Turbo

I'm having a frustrating time with multiple mechanics struggling to diagnose a number of various diagnostic warnings that occur with city driving but never highway driving. The problem is that it's a very unreliable problem to reproduce. So I'm equipping myself with a bit of base knowledge.  I took my multimeter to my battery and found:

\- **12.50v**  \-> Off

\- **14.41v** \-> Idle

\- **12.38v** \-> In gear, stopped in driveway

Is this normal?

To a novice it feels odd that it is below battery voltage when in gear. Shouldn't the alternator keep us well above? Or is this some special ""alternator is cut off so that you've got a bit of extra power early after start-up, that can be recoverd once you're warmed up and driving"" or other black magic I'm unaware of.

Extended Info:

The various diagnostic warnings have been, as written out by the latest mechanic:

Galopigos (Score: 1): Sounds normal on anything built after about 2010 or so. They have a lot of different strategies to increase fuel mileage and one of them involves regulating the alternator to only produce power at certain times. A 100% charged battery would be 12.6 volts. That is 2.1 volts per battery cell and a 6 cell battery. 12.5 would be normal for some resistance in the system. You start the engine and it will kick the alternator up in voltage to replace the power it took to start the engine, from there it coasts along with the voltage matching the load on the system. Some shut the alternator off or have it coast under certain conditions. All done to improve the EPA ratings. Those systems also count for many ""my battery was dead and the alternator wasn't working"" repairs. The battery went dead and the PCM shut the alternator off to protect it from the large load it was seeing from the bad battery."

1mfs0nr,Can the input splines of a CV drive axle wear out?,"Hey y'all, shade tree mechanic here just asking for a second opinion. 2010 Volvo s40 manual 2.4l. Engine runs fine but can switch effortlessly through all gears without clutch engaged. No power to the wheels, car won't move. With the car on jack stands in gear you'll sometimes see driver side hub spin before sporadically skipping with a knock noise. Sound coming from the CV joint where it meets the trans, and you can tell that that is where the power is slipping. 

My guess is that the splines of this CV axle have worn down to the point that they're no longer engaging, does that sound right? The input on the transmission side looks better. I just haven't seen that this is a common problem anywhere and I see a lack of metal shaving in the area that would point me to the fact that there's metal being ground away.

Friend hired me to replace the clutch in her car after someone told her that was the problem. As soon as I heard that knocking/slipping sound I knew it wasn't the clutch and let her know but she wanted me to complete it anyways.

1mfrbxr,Car at Ford dealership service department for 3 months,"This is long but could really use a mechanics insight on the situation.  Also posted on a Ford Reddit group.

 My car is currently at my local Ford Dealer's Service Department and they have been dishonest regarding my vehicle repairs.  When it initially broke down, May 12th, I was unaware of the open recall and this was not shared with me when my car was first taken in on May 16th.  I also provided them with the after market warranty information I had for my car.  I was contacted and told they needed to remove my oil pan and that labor would be ~$500.  I agreed because I needed my car repaired.

Shortly after, I found the information about the recall and contacted the service department to notify them.  Their response was, they were aware and that was not the issue with my vehicle.  This recall involves the oil belt and in order to check the part, the oil pan needed to be removed.  I asked if the labor is covered by the recall and I was told no because it was not the issue.  I was told I needed to pay the ~$500 for the labor even though it was to check the recalled parts.  

I had to contact Ford Motor Company directly which verified 2.8 hours of labor to check or replace the parts was covered by Ford for the recall and this information is available to all Ford service departments.  I contacted the service department again to which they responded, ""Ford must have updated the information."" This was not the case and they were trying to scam me to pay for recall labor.

Once they finally found the issue, they contacted my warranty company.  There was coolant in the cylinders so the entire engine needed replaced.  The warranty company sent out an inspector and the claim was approved.  I was told I needed to pay the $200 deductible plus the diagnostic fee which was $130 in order to move forward ordering the parts.  I paid the fee the following day and was told it would be 1-2 weeks.  2 weeks past and I heard nothing, so I called and was told it wasn't scheduled until July 23rd, in 3 more weeks.  

July 23rd I receive a phone call and the manager of the service department tells me that in the process of replacing the engine, multiple bolts were broken on the turbo and the catalytic converter.  I was not even notified when the first bolt was broken and they continued, breaking more hardware in the process.  I was told the parts would be over $1000 and my warranty would not cover broken hardware.  The hardware was broken due to poor workmanship which is the reason my warranty won't cover the cost.  I should not have to pay for their mistakes.  

My car is still at the dealership because I will not pay the $1000 for the parts they broke.  I feel they are just trying to get whatever money they can from me and treat me like I am ignorant.  This has been very predatory behavior and I am sure I am not the only person this has happened to.  Any help or advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.

What they should have done, to cover their ass for responsibility of broken hardware cost, is disclose the sketchy condition of the hardware and potential increased cost to the customer PRIOR to disassembly.

1mfo29f,Fuel Additive and Transmission issues?,"2015 Silverado 2500HD WT 6.0L V8

The truck has about 75,000 miles on it, and I changed the oil about two weeks ago. Recently, my dad bought two 20oz bottles of Royal Purple Max Clean Synthetic Fuel System Cleaner. Since the truck has a 36-gallon fuel tank, and the instructions said to use 1oz per gallon, I thought it would be fine to use both bottles—even though that’s a little more than the recommended amount.

When my dad filled up the truck, the gauge was nearly empty, but he only filled the tank to about 3/4 full after adding the cleaner. He drove the truck for a day or two, then started noticing a slight loss of acceleration and some slipping while driving. Soon after, the check engine light came on.

Once I realized the tank hadn’t been completely filled, I went to top it off. At that point, the tank was about half full. When I unscrewed the gas cap, I heard a sizzling noise—like pressure releasing. While pumping gas, the tank would seem to fill up extremely quickly, causing the pump to shut off every few seconds. It kept doing this, making it difficult to add more fuel because the gas wasn’t going down into the tank as fast as usual.

I took the truck to a mechanic because of these fueling issues and the slipping I’d noticed. He ran a diagnostic scan, which pulled up code P0741. He mentioned there were three codes in total, but I only remember that one related to the torque converter. He advised me to keep driving the truck to burn off more fuel so he could check the gas tank and investigate further.

Here are my questions:

* Should I change the transmission fluid? Would that help?
* Did the fuel cleaner cause these problems, or is it just a coincidence and the truck had these issue already?
* What should i do?",1,1754133485.0,3,AskMechanics,1754249632,2025-08-02 11:18:05,2025-08-03 19:33:52,"mlw35405 (Score: 2): The torque converter clutch has delaminated, sending friction material into the transmission that is clogging the filter and causing it to slip.

That vibration you felt while driving that you thought was a misfire which is why you added the fuel system cleaner in the first place was actually torque converter shudder."

I don't buy that replacing an IC in the TCM fixed the problem for one simple fact. I have 3 other used TCMs, none of them worked before and now they all work. This is 100% concrete proof that the problem was NOT the TCM.

Naturally, I need an alignment. The shop I took it to (a tire shop) said that they were unable to adjust the toe due to the tie rods being seized up, so, I'm sitting at too much toe in. They offered to replace both inner and outers for about $800.

I tried myself, and sure enough, I can separate the outer tie rod from the stopper nut, but even with penetrating oil and heat, I can't get the stopper nut to turn along the threads of the inner tie rod. There's a light patina of oxidation that I wouldn't even call rust, but it seems to be holding the nut in place.

1mfert0,Engine Codes Advice,"So I have a 2006 Toyota Yaris, with 327,000 km on it (automatic transmission). Overall has been a good car, bought it in 2022. 

This year I've been having a few issues with the car. It started off with the car shaking quite a bit when starting up, and would occasionally make some rumbling sounds. Then, it started stalling. I talked to a  neighbor who is a mechanic, and he gave me some advice and checked the engine codes. The codes P0011 and P0016 were present. He recommended doing an oil change firstly, and getting spark plugs fixed. If the above doesn't fix the symptoms, he told me to get someone to look at the VVT. 

Both an oil change and spark plug replacement were done a few days ago, and the car seems to be running better than it was. The mechanic also said my alternator and belt need to be replaced, ideally in the next month. 

Now the engine light has come back on again, has gone on and off a couple times. I've gotten a few different opinions, one mechanic said it's like a sensor that just needs replacing. My neighbor said it's likely an issue with the engine. I got him to check the codes again tonight, and they're the same ones as before (P0011 and P0016). 

I'm struggling with my decision on if it's worth it to drop more money into this car due to its age and high km. If the car is now driving better, should I still get the VVT checked out? Or is it more likely a sensor issue? I really can't afford to buy a new car right now, but of course I don't want to keep investing into this car if the engine is likely on its way out. 

Just looking for some opinions and advice on what I should do.

Same for VVT, even more so really. 327k km is no spring chicken. Start from ground zero, make absolutely sure correct oil is being used. Make sure the old isn’t contaminated/diluted with coolant water or fuel. Test or replace the sensor. If the code remains, it’s time to consider replacing most/all timing components or new car."

The original factory PPF is now melted into the paint / clear. It took a chunk of paint off when someone tried removing it. So can that be fixed?

Furthermore there’s a white gluey substance running down both doors leaving a crazy streak that looks like melting bird shit on both sides of the doors. Car looked freshly washed and I’ve seen this residue on many Lexus cars from these years. wtf is it and do the doors need to be repainted? 

The front windscreen has some shit going on. It looks like delamination? Is that going to be a problem?

It needs rear shocks as well as some other minor stuff I’m sure but that stuff is all easier than bodywork

Would you guys say it’s worth it to buy given that it still drives like a LS430 while it’s rolling on 13 year old winter tires in summer heat!

Also I saw a sticker in the door jamb that said if this car needs any kind of paint or bodywork that it must be returned to LEXUS ON THE PARK. It looked like a very official LEXUS OEM label.

The dealer told me timing chains and belts are covered by the RAC extended warranty. Which put my mind at ease, so I've opted to take  out the warranty and have put a non refundable £250 deposit on the car. I pick it up on Thursday.

On the terms of the warranty it states that cars must have been serviced in line with manufacturers recommendations, which I think is every 12k miles or year. However, the car only has partial service history, it missed 2 years of services over lockdown. So I guess this means that the warranty would be void from the outset, or does it mean that from now on it has to be serviced every 12k miles/year? Also after reading some of the posts on here about extended warranties I'd be shocked if the timing belt was actually covered. It's making me a little nervous about getting the car seen as it has the potential for such a catastrophic failure. 

Thoughts please?

If you can’t afford the GTD, you can easily get a 2.0 TDI which are reasonably torquey and do the upgrades to get it to perform on par to a GTD. 

Golf GTIs (mk7 onwards) can get reasonable mileage if you drive them sensibly - I get 40-45mpg in mine on a long run - 30-35 around town but insurance may be pricey at 19…I got mine at 20 and is just over £1k to insure but that’s very case by case basis. 

A more warm car would be the Polo Blue GT (I’d recommend the post 2015 facelift) which has 150bhp and is nippy but has the capability to run on half its cylinders for efficiency and will probably be the best to insure. 

Ford also did a diesel Focus ST but have no idea on reliability so can’t really comment but I’d imagine it’s along the same lines for fuel economy as the GTD. 

I would avoid the newer fabia VRS/2012-2014 Polo GTI because the 1.4 they put in it was twin charged and is quite well known for not being all too reliable - I know of 3 cars that have eaten themselves in one way or the other and two of those I know for a fact were very well maintained. The post 2015 Polo GTI I know is very good on the other hand and the 1.8 they put in it was a much better engine.

My father had a fabia VRS like you like and the thing wouldn’t die but I’d be worried that they are getting quite old and tired these days and if you’re going to get one, get a run out blue 2007 model because they’re more like to have been looked after well and paying the premium would be worth it to get a rock solid car. Don’t touch one that’s modified and certainly don’t touch one that’s been put back to stock because you won’t know what you’re dealing with. If you’re dead set on one, get the cleanest example and pay the premium for it because it’s less likely to bite you as these cars are getting on to be around 20 years old these days.

ProfessionBoring6982 (Score: 3): What a nice thing you’re doing. My basic advice would be: Any vehicle you like the look of, go on a car checker website and type in the registration. This will give you a basic history of the car (MOT pass rate etc and details of advisories). 

Then if the car looks good from that PoV I would pay for a full report to make sure it’s not had an accidents etc (cost is nominal and 100% worth for the peace of mind).

Finally, you then what to google search what the car’s common issues are (if they are cheap to repair and cross check against the car you would like to buy, I.e. has XYZ been changed on the car already therefore negating my GF having to pay to do it at a later date) and then finally a quick check of the engine generally to see whether it is fairly robust and bullet proof.

Unfortunately I don’t have the energy to do the above for you on that specific vehicle (been a long day, otherwise I’d save you the hassle) but that’s what I tend to do.

And then finally when you turn up to buy the car check that all the gaps between the doors align, that no plastic trims within the engine bay or interior are missing or misaligned (sign of potentially a big repair being undertaken in the past and possible bodge job). Test drive at low and high speed and work your way through the gears methodically to ensure there’s no issues. Drive with the windows up and down to listen for rattles, whines or knocking. Tyre condition and brakes are also a small cost but add up if there’s a full set required so you want a decent tread and amount left on the brake discs.

Oh and insurance, just ensure it’s going to be cheap enough for your GF to be able to insurance by herself (you won’t have any issues with the car you have found).

Best of luck with you search, I hope you find a great car and that your GF appreciates it.

It's a 1.0L engine so cheap on the road tax and you can get in 3 or 5 door. If opt for the 5 just because it's a bit more practical, but the 3 door looks a bit nicer. 

The engine is also very simple, nothing fancy to it and there are/were plenty of them on the road so any mechanic should be able to relatively cheap and simple repair if you do get any issues.

He can’t afford to do it and other than the emissions issue it’s a great van. He’s not working at the moment after a major heart op so don’t want to spend £2k if he doesn’t go back to work.

car spares shop. Has anyone used it?

If so can you help:-
It says put the can in on a 1/4 tank of diesel. Drive it until the fuel light comes on. 

Do we thrash it until the fuel light comes on or just drive normally?

Then tank up. Any Diesel recommendations? (Dad normally uses the cheapest..!). 

Do we run a full tank of diesel before MOT or just do the Italian Tuneup up?

We have noticed now it’s failed that it initially has black smoke coming from the exhaust but clears once you’ve been driving (don’t normally have someone we know driving behind us)!!

They left me with almost no fuel so I had to first get some from my local petrol station. Came home and decided to go for a run. During the run, within the 10 minutes, the clutch got stuck and wouldn't come back up. I couldn't move the gear stick and my car stalled. A guy from another car came out to help and couldn't move the clutch either and two other men along with me pushed car onto an open field on the side of the road.

One of them rang a mechanic for me who later was able to fix the clutch as he arrived and took it home. He told me to bring to his garage today, which I did, and upon inspection he said the car was badly overheated pointing to the engine coolant being the wrong colour (a dark brown colour) and said the car is too dangerous to drive anymore and to return it. Even after 20 minutes with the engine off the bonnet was hot and I noticed the car getting hot inside when driving, I was starting to sweat.

I rang the dealer who told me he'll collect it on Monday and take it back. He was trying to play down the situation saying its just a coolant problem he can fix it, but the mechanic told me its beyond repair.

So, I passed my test around 2 months ago and haven't touched a steering wheel since then purely because of insurance reasons - you don't need to tell me insurance is fked if you're 17 I've been on here enough to know that already 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️

Now, I've looked at everything, the city cars like the Up! and C1, the classic mk4 polos and golfs and even grandad cars like older skodas or ford estates (even tho I really love estates regardless, big up an old volvo)

All of these cars have been insane with insurance - the cheapest I've gotten is £1.2k with a blackbox on an '08 polo selling for £1.5k , £2.3k without a blackbox. I still feel like that is excessive, bear in mind the Up! Was over 3 thousand annually 😂

And now here's the kicker - a Volkswagen Eos from 2008 for £1500. Group insurance? Astronomical for an esteemed albeit young gentleman like myself. And yet... £900 with a blackbox and £1600 without? What the hell? This is a 2 litre fsi that looks fire and that to my limited knowledge isn't a shitbox.
