1marqw2,Need advice! First oil replacement without assistance,"I'm in the middle of performing an oil exchange (technically first time) and would like some advice.

I've got the car jacked up and am trying to remove the oil drain valve but it's not budging. In fact, I think it's damaging the ratchets and the 3/8 drive.

What happens when I try removing it:

1. 3/8 drive gives up
2. Hear a popping noise near the bolt (can't see what's happening bc I'm using all my strength)
3. Check ratchet, slightly more worn out.

Ive tried the following:

* running the car on idle
* trying different ratchets that fit
* confirmed it's not a deadbolt but might be coming near

What should I do?

1. Give up and take it to an oil exchange store
2. Get better equipment
3. Keep trying
4. Etc

Thanks for reading this far, hope it'll help me finish this job.

Other info:

* goal is to ideally use as little money as possible.
* I do have roommates that could help me get to auto parts stores without jacking down my car.
* Car is Subaru legacy 2016 2.5i premium.

1marmau,"New Rotors have clean ""ring"" around outside edge.","Hey all. Replaced my brakes and rotors today. I've done this plenty of times before; however, it's been 6 or 7 years since i last did it myself due to living situation and tools.

After putting everything together i took it on a test drive like usual. Everything felt fine, I started at slow speeds around the neighborhood, periodically breaking, and then took it on the main road at about 50 MPH. When i got back, they were smoking - which I know is normal due to the coating on the rotors (i did clean them with brake clean prior to install). 

The ""clean ring"" around the outside edge is concerning. Is this normal after replacement, or does it indicate something not making contact properly or too much contact along the outside edge?

1maqnz9,Packing grease into bearings without taking them off the shaft.,"1957 Ferguson FE35, Standard 23C four-cylinder diesel. To follow the rules, the specific vehicle doesn't matter for this question I feel.

I need to replace the axle seals on my tractor and am currently reading up on how to do it. I stumbled upon an old forum post where someone had changed them, and repacked the bearings while everything was apart.

However, he had done this without taking the bearing off the shaft. He said he got some advice from expert mechanics, but he didn't go into more detail. Googling I could only find the common method of having a glob of grease in your palm and pounding it into the bearing, which can only be done on loose bearings.

So, how would one go about doing that? As my bearings have been washed with hydraulic oil, repacking them seems like a great idea. However, getting the bearings off the axle shaft is a massively bigger job than just changing the seal, and I don't have the tools to do it.

These are tapered roller bearings, if that makes a difference.",1,1753633735.0,3,MechanicAdvice,1753733960,2025-07-27 16:28:55,2025-07-28 20:19:20,FreeSquirkJuice (Score: 1): Is there a grease fitting on it to where you can pump grease into with a grease gun?

I own a 2015 Honda Civic hybrid, no clue about the engine, but the rules here said to post that the eighth digit of my VIN is a 2. Apparently my AC compressor cannot be replaced without replacing the whole trifecta of compressor/clutch/?condenser?

I‚Äôm struggling to understand this. A few mechanics have briefly tried to explain it to me, but it‚Äôs just not sinking in.

My air conditioner started making noise a couple of weeks ago so I brought it to the mechanic. They replaced the belt tensioner which did not help. Then they added AC oil which also did not help. They said the compressor was still making noise and would probably need to be replaced, but then said that the part was unavailable and that I could buy it myself off eBay or whatnot. I decided to move on as honestly I‚Äôm not even sure *what* I would buy üò≠ (as I said, not really a car person.)

I brought it to the dealership on the off chance there may be a recall fix, no dice, but they said that they could replace the AC system for an eye-watering $7000 (more than double what the car is even worth).

I brought it to a THIRD mechanic yesterday who noticed that my Freon was empty so recharged it to see if that was the issue ‚Ä¶ but it still didn‚Äôt work so they ran a diagnostic and agreed that the condenser is still kaput and needs to be replaced. But they called Honda for the part and can‚Äôt get one because Honda doesn‚Äôt make its own AC units, and Honda told them the entire system would need to be replaced. They also agreed with the first mechanic that no parts were available for this and the best I could do is try to buy something off eBay or something.

I‚Äôve never before been told to go the eBay route by not only 1 but 2 mechanics‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs just a 2015 Honda civic hybrid! This just doesn‚Äôt seem like some crazy rare car that it should be impossible to find parts for. 

Am I being led wrong here? Or do I really need to replace the entire system and not just the condenser and buy the entire thing off eBay? It‚Äôs hard to believe. I‚Äôm not sure what to do other than just drive it with no AC.

It has electronic power steering so it could be the alternator, yeah. Or a loose belt. Or just the alternator pulley. Or a bad battery that wont hold a charge. Take it to an automotive electrical shop or a mechanic I guess..  or you can test the battery voltage with a multimeter and report back. Charge the battery up yourself or replace with a good one, then check voltage while engine runs, if it‚Äôs below 13.8v then you might have an alternator problem.
Or you have corroded wiring in the engine bay or a mouse nest. Poke around with a multimeter.. etc.
Alternator might be too complicated to replace on your own on that car keep in mind. As in requiring special tools or awkward spots for bolts and probably mandatory belt tension adjustment at a minimum

Not_me_no_way (Score: 1): First was the battery light on the dash lit up before the problems started happening? This does sound like an alternator issue. The alternator provides electricity to the vehicle while the engine is running. The battery light on the dash indicates there is a problem with the charging system. If the alternator is not functioning, the vehicle is only running on the power of the battery and it will not last long. If you are driving the vehicle with a faulty alternator this will drain the battery. Your explanation describes symptoms of an alternator not functioning. This could also be a serpentine belt problem also since the serpentine belt is what drives both the power steering pump and the alternator. The video shows signs that the battery is weak. I would first check the belt and make sure it is taunt and routed correctly around all the pulleys. If that looks ok then I would suspect the alternator has gone bad."

After it cooled down (30 mins), it wouldn't start. Traced the issue: the alternator was completely dead, zero electricity. This killed the fans, causing the engine to overheat.

I‚Äôve replaced the air filter, fuel injectors (for an unrelated issue), and spark plugs in Jan 2025, and put some fuel system cleaner in at the same time.

Drive another couple hundred miles and it's coming back now. Assuming it's same side since I did not tough the other side?

1) could it be that brake is messed up from the rotor causing the new one

I don't see the point of buying a new car for ""modern"" features, and there would be compromises, always, so I decided to add them myself. Please share your opinions or advice to help me complete my project. All very appreciated.

I already found all the parts &amp; video demonstrations on how to install, and have great friends to help me.

DONE:

1. Car Radio
   * I tried out a couple of Android 13 units until I found the one that works perfectly. No lags, AA works perfectly, Wi-Fi and hotspot work great, and I can install any apps via the Play Store. It came with a reverse camera in the kit.
2. Reverse Camera
   * I was initially skeptical of the Camera, but it performed exceptionally well, with no lag and a clear picture. It was funny how a cheap camera was better than my college friend's Camera in his 2025 truck, lol.
3. Blind Zone Mirrors
   * Nothing special, square blind zone mirrors that stick to the existing mirrors at the corner.
4. Window Visors
   * Nothing special, window visors from Amazon do their job great by keeping rain/snow out. Worked great on my ski trips.
5. LED Pods
   * I didn't like how the sides of the road weren't appropriately lit, so the LED pods help fix that issue. Works excellently in Vermont/New Hampshire, especially in dark areas. They are mounted at the top of the hood, but I will probably upgrade to a lightbar at the mid-bottom of the bumper.
6. Hood Struds
   * Nothing special, but it makes it easier to open the hood, especially for folks who aren't used to doing it, like my mom.
7. Dash Cam
   * BlackVue front and rear cloud dashcam. I pay $10/month for 2 GB of data and get access to remotely view and track the car for free.

TODO:

1. Fog Lights
   * LE models don't have fog lights, so I'm planning to install ones with turn signal support.
2. Front Camera
   * My Android unit supports a front camera, and they cost around $30, so I thought, 'Why not?' Goes into the Toyota emblem and looks invisible.
3. Folding Mirrors
   * I've got my mirrors crushed a couple of times when parked, so I'm planning to upgrade them to a folding &amp; heated set with turn signal support.
4. Kill Switch
   * Just to make it a little harder for an average Jo.
5. Steering Wheel Buttons
   * My Android units support button remapping, but the LE model lacks steering wheel buttons, so I plan to add them.
6. Blind Zone Sensors
   * Typically, these are located at the corners of the mirrors, but I plan to install them inside the interior, at the bottom of the front windows. The sensors go behind the rear bumper.
7. Heated Seats
   * My seats are not leather or stitched, so I would like to upgrade them by adding heated seats. At my dash, where the AC controls are located, there is a 1-Poverty button filler and the AUX on the left. Both of these will be the controls for the seats.
8. Front Driver &amp; Passenger Doors
   * Someone crashed into the doors while the car was parked. Although it wasn't severely damaged and was repaired, it eventually rusted, and I don't want to take on a third repair. So, I want to get two new doors from a junkyard.
9. Window Tint
   * Once the doors are replaced, tint the windows.
10. Full Wrap
   * Once the doors and the tinting are done, I want to wrap it black or with some design, but I haven't decided yet.",1,1753607188.0,3,MechanicAdvice,1753733960,2025-07-27 09:06:28,2025-07-28 20:19:20,"Teavis-Tug (Score: 1): A lot of this seems like a giant waste of money.

Could be a loose connector at a control module like the BCM/pcm or bad fuse box or fuse block.   Vibrations from the door is moving something most likely.  Connector scenario should fill car with codes after it does this.   If there‚Äôs a fuse block on top of the battery it may be in there somewhere, that often won‚Äôt produce codes.

Start with seeing that battery connections are tight and the ground cable is attached at both ends.  and what kind of B, C and U codes set during these events.   If it‚Äôs a module connector all the codes will be related to the wires in that specific connector.  If none, most possible it has something to do with the battery/cables area or fuse block attached it.  Can only see the fault with testing instruments while it‚Äôs dead.

Smoke = when you give it gas at the bottom of the hill, the computer introduces fuel again and this mixes with all the built up oil vapour when it burns. Burning oil produces blue-ish white smoke which is what you're seeing.

I imagine if you idle it long enough then accelerate, you get the same white smoke.

1maaab5,"2010 Honda Odyssey EX-L V6 3.5 liter with 205,000 miles - Huge debilitating electrical issues - Please Help!!","Oh boy I don't even know where to begin on this. I'm looking for answers fast, or advice on what to do next. I'm getting to the point where I feel like I need to sell it for scrap, but I'm hoping it doesn't come to that.

I've been having weird electrical problems with the vehicle which has now culminated in the vehicle experiencing battery drain daily. To keep it going I have to use a car jump starter to get it started basically every day or even multiple times per day now.

It all started around the beginning of May, when the vehicles alarm system kept going off for no apparent reason multiple times a day. The light for the passenger sliding door was also stuck on. So I assumed that was the problem and replaced the door closing sensor/switch, but that didn't help. I ended up disabling the alarm altogether using a jumper at the hood switch after failing to find any answers online on how to fix it.

A few weeks down the line I found the vehicle dead in the morning and used my jump starter tool to get it going. Later that day while I was driving it the rear passenger window mysteriously rolled down on it's own. I tried to roll it up but it wouldn't go. After some time feeling bewildered trying to figure out what to do, the window rolled itself back up and I went on with my day.

Over the course of the next few days I began to notice a lot of clicking noises coming from the back of the van (sometime while driving, sometimes they were going off when I'd open the door in the morning). I guessed that they were solenoids but still not sure about that. At the time we were experiencing a lot of rain and so I figured that these now obvious electrical problems might have something to do with water penetration. The battery drain was becoming much more frequent at this stage.

Finally, around the end of May, my van died while I was driving. I managed to limp it to AutoZone, and with their help determined that the alternator had gone bad. I bought a new battery and limped the vehicle to my mechanic and got the alternator replaced.

It's around this time that I'm starting to panic. I use this van for my job, obviously I need it to work reliably. So I moved forward with my plan to buy a work van that I'd been saving for. I'm annoyed because I wasn't not ready to make that purchase but there I was. I needed to do it.

Even though I bought the new van, I still really want the old van to work, so that I can use it for personal use, and not run up my work van mileage too fast, so I kept searching online to see if I could get the problem resolved.

I found several mentions of sealing the roof rack seams and side sliding door rails. I also found videos on getting into the rear panels and looking at the fuse box to inspect for water damage. I went ahead and sealed the roof rack seams with sealant, and opened up the panels in the rear to find the fuse box and connectors. I didn't find any damage but did see some evidence of water intrusion. I sealed some of the connectors with dielectric grease. I did as much work as I could get to but not as much as I would of liked because it was a real struggle to get behind some of the panels.

Things seemed to stabilize, and for a while I was able to drive the Odyssey without any significant problems. Sadly that did not last. Were now into end of July. It's been very hot and dry for days in a row, and mostly dry for weeks. Yet I  can still hear the solenoids clicking. And now, basically every day, I have to start the van with a jump starter.

My last investigation online finally brought my attention to the main computer / fuse box in the front drivers side by your feet. I thought it would be worth taking the risk to replace it and found the part for around $300. But it turns out that the $300 replacement fuse box is only for the lesser model. Since my Odyssey comes with the moon roof and the DVD player built in I need the more advanced box. That one is $1000. 

Well, that's become the end of the road for me. I don't want to spend $1000 on a part that may or may not fix the problem.

I can't tell you how disappointed I am. From what I'd heard my belief was that the Odyssey was a massively reliable work horse and that I could expect to have it keep going well over the 300,000 mile mark. I thought that I would have plenty of time to save for a replaement personal car before needing to ditch it. I really don't want to just scrap it. I though for sure I could sell it to someone for a couple of grand. But now cant imagine getting more than $250 to scrap it.

Any chance anyone here can help me figure out this problem? Can it be fixed? Or should I just get rid of it?

This got me digging into the cooling system. The truck warms up pretty quick, like within 90 seconds it usually starts to climb up to the 1/4 mark on the temperature gauge but I live in So Cal so its usually like 60-80 degrees here. The **upper radiator hose** and the **upper plastic housing** on the **radiator** both get warm gradually and then after about 7 minutes of the engine running they get hot fast. I touched the actual **radiator core** where all the metal is and its cool to the touch like stepping on tile thats been in the shade all day. The **lower radiator plastic housing** and the **lower radiator hose** are both warm but not hot. 

Edit: When I use the cabin heater it's warm but not like hair dryer hot it's just kinda warm. Also im currently getting like 12.9MPG in the city and city average is supposed to be closer to 16MPG so I am seeing drop in engine performance. 

Im really confused because Im new to wrenching. My understanding is that if the radiator isn't getting hot its probably clogged and if its clogged I should be overheating not under-heating, right? Im starting to think that I may just have a lazy temperature gauge in my dash cluster but the fact that the radiator doesn't get hot makes me think something more serious may be wrong.

my current working theories are 1. the **radiator** is clogged and isn't flowing, but then why am I not overheating? 2. the **thermostat** is stuck open/ partially open keeping the engine cool and the **radiator** isn't  needed but then why would the **lower radiator hose**  and **lower radiator plastic housing** be getting warm instead of just continuing to flow through the **bypass**? 3. my dash cluster is a lazy piece of shiet and im overthinking this.

Does it run hot or overheat?  Do you get white smoke (it is actually steam) out the exhaust for more than a couple of minutes when the engine is cold?  Does the engine oil look like chocolate milk? These are signs of a bad head gasket, which can be caused by overheating, which might have happened when you had the previous leak.

But... these cars have a lot of plastic parts in the cooling system, and they get brittle, crack and leak when they get older. The thermostat cover is a common one.  You can get metal parts to replace the fragile plastic ones.  Look again for a small leak somewhere.   

If you have not driven more than 50 or 100 miles since the last leak was fixed, it is also possible that there was some air in the cooling system that worked its way out.

But I can't tell from the picture if it has slipped or not.

If the starter turns the engine faster than usual, that often means no compression, which is what happens when the pistons hit the valves and bend them.  If this happened, you need to at least rebuild the head.  And that's if the pistons aren't damaged.

If the starter doesn't turn the engine over, try turning it by hand.  It's possible the timing skipped, and the resulting damaged has jammed the motor - in which case it is shot.

It's also possible it won't turn over (no crank) or won't start (crank, no start) for many other reasons, and although you may have world's oldest and most worn-out timing belt it hasn't actually failed yet."

It has about 152,000 miles on it, and i suspect i'll put about a 1,000 more before the trip, but it has made it to Nashville once(when it had about 120,000) and has made two trips to my sisters house which is about 285 miles away( once at 135,000 miles, once at about 140,000) We have recently replaced the alternator, the battery, the starter, and the ignition switch, and she has no lights on currently or any major issues that would warrant worry.

The service records were very detailed, but I saw no sign of work for transmission oil/filter, coolant, brake lines, etc. I brought it to my mechanic, who I trust, to do the work. He checked everything and told me he doesn't think anything needs to be changed. The tranny oil is very clean, no issues with the coolant. He gave my van back without any work done (and no charge; he's a good guy).

I'm a little wary after having to replace the transmission in my last van, and I'm thinking I should AT LEAST change the transmission oil and filter against his advice. He implied that doing so could open a can of worms and introduce problems I wouldn't have had if I had left it alone. Can it be reasonable that transmission oil (or any other system) would be fine after 100k mi, and how long should I expect to be able to go before I do have the fluids changed?",1,1753639584.0,4,MechanicAdvice,1753734713,2025-07-27 18:06:24,2025-07-28 20:31:53,"Inevitable-Web2606 (Score: 3): There is a persistant myth out there that you shouldn't change old transmission fluid because the bit of crud floating around in the fluid somehow keep the transmission working.

What often happens is someone notices their transmission isn't shifting like it used to.  It is getting worn out, due to age, miles, the fluid never having been changed, or it's a weak design.  They change the fluid in the hope that will help.  Just like changing the oil won't help a motor with worn rings, this doesn't help the transmission - which fails sometime not too long after the fluid was changed.  The owner feels like the fluid change (which cost a few hundred dollars) caused the problem.  But it didn't - the problem was there before the fluid was changed.  However, this is hard to prove, and the owner is upset that the fluid changed ""ruined"" their transmission.

I need your help understanding what happened to my rear windshield. I parked my VW Golf overnight in a secure parking lot (no signs of vandalism or forced entry ‚Äî it's not a break-in or a violent act). The next morning, I found the rear glass shattered with two holes on each side, as you can see in the photo.

What's strange is that near both holes, on the inside edge, there are defrost (defogger) connector tabs glued to the glass. Could this be related? The rear defrost was not in use recently and this switch was off.

I'm wondering:

Could this be a spontaneous failure due to internal stress?

Could it be caused by a short circuit or a bad ground that triggered the defroster unintentionally?

If it overheated, why didn't the fuse blow instead of heating the glass to that point?

Has anyone experienced something similar?

1marseb,"2010 Infiniti EX35 - Alternator Voltage Drops After Warm-Up, But Rises with Wipers?","Hi everyone,

I have a 2010 Infiniti EX35 and recently noticed some strange behavior with my charging system. I installed a small OBD2 display (like a HUD) that shows vehicle speed, coolant temp, and voltage. I replaced my battery back in March with a new one from Costco, matched to the correct group size for the car.

Here's what I'm seeing:

* On cold start, voltage is around **14.3V**, which seems normal.
* Once the engine warms up and coolant temp stabilizes (\~84¬∞C), the voltage **drops to around 13.1V**.
* Turning on **headlights, AC, or seat heaters** has no effect‚Äîvoltage stays at 13.1V.
* However, if I turn on the **windshield wipers**, voltage **rises to 13.8‚Äì13.9V**. Once I turn the wipers off, voltage drops back down to 13.1V again.

This behavior seems consistent and repeatable.

I was planning to replace the **voltage regulator and brushes** in the alternator (I already bought the parts), thinking that might be the issue. But I asked ChatGPT, and it suggested the regulator is probably fine, and that this might be **ECU-controlled charging** logic or possibly a faulty **battery current sensor**.

So now I'm unsure. Is it even worth opening up the alternator at this point? Could this really be the ECU undercharging the battery based on incorrect data or logic?

Has anyone seen this before on a Nissan or Infiniti vehicle? Is this expected behavior, or should I dig deeper into the current sensor / ECU side of things?

1maqd6f,"Struggling teacher can't find a replacement clock spring, need help","Greetings All,

So here we go. I have a 2012 Nissan Pathfinder. My horn went out. We needed to replace the airbag and get a clock spring.  We have a friend who is a mechanic who is priced INSANELY reasonably. I can't afford a regular shop/dealership. The problem is, we usually have to get our parts. He calls and helps when he can, but he is not computer savvy enough to search parts online. And we live like an hour away from him.  So we can't sit together and look at the parts.  We can't find a clockspring that fits our wheel. I brought the old spring home to search on EBAY. Everything on eBay does not match. Like, there are three connectors. One 11-pin connector and two 8-pin connectors. Everything I am finding is showing one of the 8-pin connectors as 8 pins straight across. On my part, one of my 8-pin connectors has 3 pins on top & 5 on the bottom. I can attach pictures. I am freaking out because my registration goes out soon, and it won't pass inspection without a functioning horn.  I have searched the Nissan site with my VIN number, I can't even get a real picture of the part there. It only shows pictures of the parts I keep getting with the two 8-pin straight across.",2,1753633024.0,13,automotive,1753734713,2025-07-27 16:17:04,2025-07-28 20:31:53,"zed2point0 (Score: 2): Try local junkyards

I think the most annoying thing I have encountered is that many tow truck companies won't let you go with them to where the vehicle is being dropped off.  Which then leads to getting an UBER on top of the tow truck and ensuring you all get to the same garage and then finding where they left your car on the lot.  It is just extra hassle, extra cost etc.  Getting home used to be tricky afterwards but now pretty much everyplace just gives you a loaner car to use while they fix it which has been nice.

I have been driving for about 25 years and call phones have made everything much easier and faster.  Once I have gotten in touch with the roadside assistance company though they always have someone show up in 20-30 minutes.  

Issues I have not experienced but hear about are tow trucks refusing to try and jumpstart a car or provide like a gallon of gas just to get to the next station.

I recently had to get my car towed due to a flat tire I got driving through a construction zone.  It was quite easy, but I did have to be specific that I have an AWD EV, and it is low, so they ended up sending a flat bed.  Apparently when people call in, they frequently don't say what the vehicle is (and apparently are not asked or do not relay the information to the tow truck driver).

I‚Äôm currently on a long drive from Tenerife, Spain to Sweden, and I‚Äôve run into a pretty worrying issue with my car. Hoping someone here might have some insight.

When I first left Tenerife, I noticed that when I shifted into third or fourth gear and accelerated more heavily, the RPMs would shoot up, but the speed didn‚Äôt match ‚Äî like the engine was revving but not transferring the power to the wheels. It felt like a slipping clutch, but the issue only lasted about five minutes, then stopped. I was able to continue driving all the way up through Europe without a problem.

Now I‚Äôve made it to Germany and the issue has come back ‚Äî only this time it‚Äôs much worse. I can technically still drive, but only very slowly. If I try to overtake another car or accelerate even moderately, the RPMs just rise rapidly but the car doesn‚Äôt pick up speed. It‚Äôs especially bad in higher gears. This is making it hard to stay on the highway or drive safely.

Has anyone experienced this before? Could it be the clutch? Or something else like a sensor or transmission issue?

Is there a parasitic draw that is draining the battery life over night and overworking the alternator in the morning?

Are there aftermarket items that are adding too much load for the alternator/battery?

One of the biggest things I see is poor connections at the battery/alternator. The alternator is an on demand device and poor connections will make the alternator ""think"" it has to work harder. I'd start here with voltage drop testing or a thermal camera to find the hot spot/high resistance."

If it truly is surface rust that I can sandpaper away and put some sort of treatment on, I can do that. But the degree of rust is what is in question.

1magcs7,Socket stuck in spark plug hole,"'02 Suzuki Vitara 2.0 4WD  
I know there have been several posts about this same issue but mine is different and I've not been able to solve it. My Vitara has a suspension brace (I'm including photos) right above the second spark plug hole that is making it (so far) impossible to get to the socket in a proper or effective way to get it out. I've tried everything suggested in other posts. Nothing is working. The plug is not stuck, it actually wiggles so it is definitely loose. The plug even wiggles a  bit but I'm pretty sure it isn't unscrewed quite all the way. If the brace wasn't in the way I wouldn't even be here making this post because I'm sure I could have gotten the socket out by now and plugs changed. The clearance between the tip of the plug in that hole and the underside of the brace is about 7.5 inches to give you an idea of how little room I  have to work with.   
Tried grabber tools, magnets, tape, screwdrivers, and so on. The right shape/strength magnet would probably work but I haven't been able to find just right kind that will fit in the hole *and* is strong enough. Gripper tools just are useless. Even the flexible ones. They can't grab around the socket. I'm not going to go to the trouble of removing the brace and chance screwing something up something else in the process. I'm not a mechanic after all. My brother in law had the same problem once and the mechanic he used had a tool that got it out but he doesn't know the name of the tool so I don't know what to look for.  I found something similar to what he described so I'll post that pic too.

The hook remover tool is similar to what my brother in law said the mechanic used except it was flexible. He was able to grab the socket with it. This hook remover MAY work if I can't figure out something else but again, with the brace in the way I think a  flexible one would be more likely to get it. Anyone know what the tool is I'm talking about? It had the same or very similar handle grip as this one but the rest was flexible.

There are many components on a car and all of them need to be looked over regularly. You don't wait for it to break down and then fix it. If something is iffy, you stop driving till it is fixed properly. Just as you shouldn't drive a vehicle with the check engine light on. If the light is on, something is wrong, fix it, or it will cost 10x as much."

1ma4cpd,Cleaning A/C condensation drain line in 2013 Forester,"Hi! I don't know much at all about cars but am trying to learn some things on my own just to be more indepenent. I think that there is a clog in the a/c condensation line in my car (lots of water leaking onto passenger floor after a long drive), and after watching a couple of videos, the easiest thing to try to fix it seemed like something I could handle, at least as a place to start.

In all the videos, including one that looked exactly like mine, the guys were just popping the line off of where it attached with almost zero effort, and then cleaning the line with compressed air and a pipe cleaner. When I try to remove the tubing, it is REALLY hard to get off. There is no bracket or anything, just the end covering whatever the opening under it is called (sorry). 

I think with some effort I probably COULD remove the tubing, but now I'm worried about getting it back, since it's so tight. None of the videos showed them reattaching it. So my questions are, is it normal for it to hard to remove? Is there some special tool or trick to getting it back on? Should I just leave this be? I have not actually removed it yet, just noticed it was really hard to get off and thought it seemed wrong.

General-Analysis1772 (Score: 1): The caster on the l/f is too positive. That could give a pull to the left. Most vehicles dont have an adjustment for that though. There is also something called conicity. That pertains to the sidewalls of the tires. On one tire, one sidewall can be stiffer than the other. This makes the car pull to one side more than the other too. To verify, swap front tires side to side, then verify pull. If it still pulls left, recheck alignment. If pulls right, suspect r/f tire for conicity. Dismount tire and mount other side out and reverify.

I took it to the mechanic this morning and after he looked at it, he said your lucky the engine wasnt seized. He said it wants to turn over but it needs more juice. So he connected it to this big machine and said when it starts to crank give her some gas. We keep trying and trying for about 15 minutes when I thought all was lost he said lets try it one last time because she wants to start we can hear that. So, we tried one last time and BOOM she freakin started. Yahoo! So he added one more liter of oil and just let it run for about an hour, revving it up every so often to get the engine well lubricated, then he did a full oil change and it started back up with no issues and he tested the battery and everything else like the starter and the alternator and did a full diagnostic on her and its all good to go. He had no idea why what happened happened but said that the mechanic who did the last oil change may not have put in the right amount. Because I seen no oil on my driveway and he saw no links when it was up on the hoist. Either way I am just glad its running now. I will have to always ask to see the dipstick after every oil change from now on! üòä"
1maekjz,Tensioner Pulley on 2014 Civic,"I replaced my alternator a few years ago on my Civic with success, so I felt doing other maintenance related to my serpentine belt.  Today I work on replacing my idler pully and serpentine belt itself as part of regular maintenance.

I replaced the idler pulley, but am uncertain if I overtightend it or not.  Some tutorials say ""good and tight"" is adequate, others are saying 33 ft-lbs.  I can't fit my torque wrench in there to get it to spec, even with a crow foot add-on, so I just used a regular crescent wrench tightening it ""snug"".

I'm concerned because the pulley won't rotate when I try to rotate it by hand.  Is that normal?  If I loosen it so that it moves freely, the bolt feels pretty loose.  Will it move freely when being spun by the car?  Should I worry?

I‚Äôve seen the shudder fix sometimes clear this up and other times not work at all or the problem comes back. 

What you‚Äôre experiencing at speed with the vibration l/shudder is when the transmission and torque converter go into ‚Äòlock up‚Äô at that speed for efficiency of the transmission usually it normally would go into lock up and stay in lock up until you slow down and the transmission down shifts, or you press the accelerator down to speed up and the transmission down shifts.

But what‚Äôs happening is you have the torque converter shuttling quickly in and out of lock up and never completely staying in lock up, which causes the transmission to work much harder and get hotter. And the hotter that transmission gets the more damage it‚Äôs incurring all the time.

Brake pads also wearing thin (appears to be all wheels) and real axle corroding.

We had planned to sell it as we kind of need a newer car. The air con doesn't work either and it's a three door; we've recently had a baby and getting in and out of a three door is tedious. Had hoped to be able to put a grand against a newer car but it looks like those hopes have gone. 

Doesn't seem worth it to me to even bother repairing? Even if I spend ¬£500 to get it back on the road, a potential buyer will look at the MOT and see it needs new brake pads.

Rear axle corroding is a pretty meaningless/subjective advisory, don't worry.

Slapping an MOT on (even if it means ¬£300 outlay) would make it an easy private sale. And you'd get a lot more than scrap value (¬£150? at a guess). Plus it buys you time to find a car you would prefer.

The aircon may be worth topping up, (you can often get it for ¬£50 on a deal), but if it's broken or leaking probably not worth fixing. Get a top up where you don't pay if they discover it's physically broken (doesn't hold pressure).

Also, if it saves you much money, I doubt anyone buying a user car cares about brakes wearing thin, it's a cheap easy to DIY repair.

However if it is ¬£500‚Ä¶.
As much as I hate to consign cars to scrap it sounds like in your situation getting rid of it as is would be the best option. 
You could try and sell it online as a non-runner/ project to see if any hobby mechanics want to take it on and keep it on the road. You would have to advertise it on the marketplaces and deal with people though, and can be quite the hassle.
Most likely though it would be best to call your local Toyota breakers yard and ask how much they would offer for it. 
You could weigh it in at the scrap yard, and it would be the least hassle, but small cars at weigh in are going for less than ¬£80 and once your factoring in the transport costs you might just be paying someone to take it away.

If it‚Äôs going to go, I‚Äôd say try and see if a breakers would take it, but do some research and see if the damage is as bad as the mechanic said.

It ticks a lot of boxes in terms of price and value, but of course, I‚Äôm hesitant and would like advice on people who‚Äôve dealt with this model in particular. 

I‚Äôm reading about the TDCI engines and I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre for me. I live in a small city and it‚Äôll only be used for shopping, commuting and short distance drives. 

I ideally want to keep the purchase under ¬£10,000 and will be buying on a bank loan at around 7%. 

Ran an insurance quote and it also seems very good price wise. 

Any thoughts or advice on this model? Should I run? Should I look at a different car?

I‚Äôm looking at buying a 2019 Ford Focus Mk4 1.0 EcoBoost with around 75,000 miles on it. I‚Äôve read a ton of mixed opinions online about the EcoBoost engines ‚Äî some horror stories have definitely made me second-guess things, even though I see loads of these ecoboost cars on the road every day.

As far as I understand, the 2019 model has a timing chain (not a belt), but it still uses a wet belt for the oil pump ‚Äî is that right? If so, is it something I should be seriously worried about at this mileage, or is it generally reliable if it‚Äôs been serviced properly?

Also curious ‚Äî how do people find these to drive? I‚Äôm not expecting performance, just enough power to cruise comfortably and overtake when needed. It‚Äôs a manual, in case that makes a difference.

I've kinda quietly learned that your list price should include a haggle tax on it. 

I think it's the nature of these online mass selling platforms. Unless someone has shown up absolutely set on acquiring the thing that day and you have it - you will always be hit with this kinda shit. It's probably because they sit browsing through hundereds of other potential things and the feeling of ""getting the deal"" ends up being the advantage.

If you have an average car (which you do) and do average mileage, then I'd start with the current retail price -- about ¬£11-12k according to Auto Trader -- subtract a couple of thousand to account for the difference between forecourt and priavate/trade-in sales, and then knock off maybe... 10% per year?

The time has come for my dad to move on from his 2010 Jaguar XF. He‚Äôs getting a little older and less mobile and wants something a bit higher - ideally a small SUV.

* Petrol. Mild hybrid possibly.

1maizqa,Middle lane hoggers are right to do so,"It's a rule from a different time. It's not 1970 where you encounter a few cars per mile. If there's any level of congestion it just doesn't make sense. 

We love to mock the 'brain dead middle lane hoggers', but imagine this. You're overtaking a lorry, and there's not another one for a few hundred metres so you dutifully pull in front of it. Your slot in the queue of overtaking cars immediately disappears. 

After maybe 30 - 45 seconds you approach the next lorry and want to overtake, so you start looking for a gap in the stream of cars in lane 2. One doesn't appear, and you reach the lorry. Now you're sat waiting for a safe gap that doesn't exist. You're switching between looking in your mirror and at the arse of the lorry every second or so, frustrated, wasting time. Eventually a passable gap does appear and you plant your foot and go for it.

Unfortunately someone from lane 3 has decided to move left at that time so you have to abort and slam on your brakes. Eventually you manage to find another gap and overtake.

Repeat this process constantly for the entire run. Now do this twice a day, five days a week, for years.

Meanwhile the guys chilling on ACC in lane 2 don't have any of this stress. They're listening to a podcast, idly wondering about what they'll have for dinner and if Emily from Accounts was flirting with them or just being friendly, getting where they're going as fast as the road will let them.

Trying to swim against the current in this situation is futile.

What would happen if everyone did move left? There would be hundreds more cumulative lane changes per mile of moterway, and I bet that would lead to a significant increase in crashes.

I had three kids under 5 at one point and that means you need 3 proper car seats.

1ma7gqs,Thinking of getting an 2017 Audi A5 1.4 TFSI,"Hi guys,
First time reddit poster. I am thinking of getting this Audi A5. It is quite well specced and has only 1 previous owner. I am in love with the exterior and interior looks of the car.
However, the mileage is quite high. I don‚Äôt mind the 1.4 TFSI engine, as I don‚Äôt speed that much and drive mostly in 20mph roads.
I‚Äôve been told Audi recommends changing the timing chain at 75k miles, but the timing chain or water pumps for this hasn‚Äôt been replaced. The dealer said it sounds smooth, so shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. I am a bit worried about that.
Overall, I just want advice on whether this would be a good choice for the price and if there is anything specific I should ask the dealer/look for before proceeding.

I do think the engine is underpowered for a car of its weight though. Also, the 2L engines in these were just more robust but if you are conscious of running costs then sure go ahead, it is a great car.

Anything that impacts or deviates how the car behaves/sounds/performs/handles from factory is a mod. Specific wording will vary between insurers but your own policy documents should cover it enough to not leave any wiggle room for interpretation - after all, wording and lack of ambiguity is what allows insurers to turn a profit.

Plenty of mods, including a lot of exhaust work and performance mods, are road legal and aren't an issue for an MOT - since an MOT is purely an emissions check and a bare minimum of roadworthiness, you have to be daft to fail an MOT. Obvious DPF deletes and decats are usually a case of MOT testers turning a blind eye, and there's no shortage of testers happy to look the other way. Police aren't staffed enough to pull over cars that are modded and then cross reference specific policies to see if they cover the mods either, they'll usually only use it to further a case unless you've pissed them off or they've got a bone to pick. VOSA/DVSA aren't staffed enough to set up enough check points to crack down on it either apart from in specific areas for a publicity job. A valved exhaust shouldn't fail an MOT since the valve and secondary flow path aren't testable items, you'd set it to flow through the cat for the test & obviously the straight piped path is purely for off-road/private use only...

On the legit flip side, mods aren't half as bad to insure as people make out (especially on this subreddit) and you can highly modify most cars whilst still being road legal, provided you pick the correct parts and methods (200/400 cell sports cats instead of a decat, for example). With a few years no claims under your belt, even some of the most extreme mods are negligible in terms of policy prices (engine swapping my E30 to twice the factory output cost me a whopping ¬£40 extra per year). Plenty of people are running road legal mods, insured as such, sailing through MOTs and everything is above board.

Both. 

For insurance purposes it's anything that alters the car from standard. Non-genuine direct replacement parts are OK but when you start doing de-cats, changing the exhaust for a louder one etc that isn't.

Those who are driving modded ones aren't getting away with it, they've just yet not been in a situation where either the police have stopped them and done an insurance check or they've had to make a claim and the insurance has inspected the vehicle.
