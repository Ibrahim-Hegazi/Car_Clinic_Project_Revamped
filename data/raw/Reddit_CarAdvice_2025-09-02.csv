Fixing the misfire should be your first step, as a smoother-running engine will make it easier to isolate the actual noise source.

Direct Loud Reverse Diagnostic Tests:

* Exhaust system: With the engine off and fully cool, jack the car up safely, support it with jack stands, and shake the exhaust pipes and heat shields, especially near the downpipe and midsection. Listen for rattles or contact points.

* Mount check: Lower the car, open the hood, and have a helper shift between Park and Reverse while you watch the engine. Excessive movement or clunking indicates worn engine or trans mounts.

* Load test: With the car in Reverse and brake applied, have your helper gently raise RPMs to around 1,500. Listen for differences in sound: roaring usually points to the exhaust, clunking may suggest mounts, axles, or something making contact.

* CV joints/axles: While driving slowly in reverse circles in a quiet lot, listen for clicking or popping, classic signs of worn CV joints. Also inspect axles for torn boots or grease leaks.

* Contact point under load: Use a mirror or camera under the car to spot anything close to the frame, subframe, or exhaust that could touch when the drivetrain shifts under reverse torque.

* Scan for codes: Re-scan for misfire and fuel trim codes (like P0304 or P0172) to track misfire severity. Misfire can increase engine shake and exaggerate any of the above issues.

Based on symptoms, the noise is likely a mix of vibration from the misfire and a mechanical or contact issue triggered under reverse torque. Happy hunting."

1n6055r,Not sure I'm reading the dipstick properly,"Car: 2017 Hyundai Sonata

Engine: 4 Cylinder 2.4L

Mileage: 60k

First off, I'm a complete novice at all this, so apologies if I'm missing details.

  
My Sonata has had oil level issues in the past and I feel stuck on what to do. Each time I've checked my oil, the car has been on a flat surface with the engine off for at least 30 minutes to a few days. I have wiped it clean first, dipped it back in, and checked it again.

  
Background in case its relevant: Two years ago during an oil change, the mechanic said my oil was ""very low"" and I should bring it back another day to check for a leak. I looked it up and my car specifically has a history of burning oil, so it also could be that. Before I could bring it in again, my check engine light came on driving to work, and it was clear something was wrong with the engine (it wasn't accelerating well). I didn't really have the money to fix it at that time, so I drove my wife's car for a while. When I got around to trying to fix the car, I checked the oil, and I only saw oil on one side of the dipstick and none all the way across (which I read means its not filled enough). Since the battery had died due to the winter weather, and I called AAA and while they were replacing the battery I asked if he could add the oil for me (which I had purchased 5 quarts of). He agreed, and I drove the car to the nearest Hyundai dealership to get the engine fixed. When I got there, one of the things they noticed besides the engine issues was that there was too much oil in the engine. The AAA assigned mechanic had put the full 5 quarts the vehicle takes, which I now know was clearly wrong and I assume he thought that I had drained the oil first and just asked him to add all of it. I just kinda trusted that he knew what he was doing. Regardless of this mishap, this at least meant SOME oil was in the engine at the time of adding that extra oil, even though I was reading it as near empty.

  
I got my oil changed at a new mechanic two months ago (drove approx. 1,500 miles since then), and a week or so ago my oil light flashed on and off for a split second. Since it didn't stay on, I kept driving, but a couple days ago, I saw it flash twice while driving 15 minutes round trip. When I looked this up, I saw a thread that said it could mean low oil, so I went to check my dipstick. I didn't see any oil on the dipstick other than the sides again. Fearing my engine was burning oil again, I filled a half quart, checked, and didn't see any difference. I added another half quart, and started seeing a little bit of oil on the dipstick near the bottom all the way across. Now, I didn't have more oil to add, so I went and bought more yesterday. I checked the oil again and saw that it was still only completely across on the bottom. Now I added another half quart and I didn't see any increase to the oil level all the way across, but I do see more on both sides WAY above the fill line. Before the sides only had a little oil, now its much more pronounced, but there's still none in the middle of the stick. I've attached pictures of the latest check of the dipstick.

  
My worries are both that I'm underfilled or overfilled and I'm just not reading the dipstick correctly. The middle of the dipstick on the side with the notches does NOT seem to have anything in the middle of the dipstick, but both sides of the dipstick definitely have a little past the F. But its also very close to the oil change I just had, I doubt it can be reading completely empty? Especially after I added 1.5 quarts? What should I do?

After my friend jumped it, I go to show my friend the absurdity of the horn, and as I kick it on, the truck dies again. This time, it can't be started at all with or without a jump. I have completely disconnected that horn.

I got the battery checked at autozone. It had a cold crank amperage peak of about 10A. Bad battery. Replaced it, still nothing. It seems the starter is not firing. Checked all the relays, they seemed good. Checked continuity to the starter, good, from the starter, good. Starter doesn't do anything when turning ignition.

Is it a problem with the starter? Why'd it stop while driving? The battery and starter went bad at the same time? I thought it could be due to that rigged up horn that maybe didn't have enough resistance flowing straight through the battery that caused just crazy current. With both the battery being bad and the starter now seeming faulty, it seems there's something systemic.

Next thing I will probably have to jack it up and get the starter tested.  
Any ideas? Advice? Thank you!

1n6001w,Should you always choose an independent shop over a dealership in the USA?,"Is it just me, or should you absolutely never take your car to a dealership for repairs/diagnostics when out of warranty? I usually cite book time and how it can unwittingly negatively affect the customer experience. My personal bias says I dislike dealerships because they are anti-competitive and only exist because of old US federal laws. All new cars sold in the US have to be sold to a 3rd party dealership and can't be direct from the manufacture. I have always recommended an independent specialty shop over dealerships. Is this bad advice to give? Even though I have heard countless horror stories about dealership service centers from people I know and posts online, my personal biases could be clouding my judgment. From yall's experience, am I right to assume this? For non USA people, is it better there?

1n5zn8c,Cable from positive battery terminal to fuse box is loose,"2000 Totota Tundra V6:

My car has a parasitic draw on the battery. The temporary solution I've used is using these easy-remove battery terminals, since there won't be a draw when they are disconnected from the battery. 

These terminals have worked well so far, but one problem I've encountered is that the cable that goes from the positive terminal to under the fuse box is loose, as shown in the video. When this happens, the car won't start and nothing electrical works. One ""solution"" that works is pushing the cable in a bit after reconnecting the positive terminal, but obviously this is a bit sketchy, as I don't know if it will come loose while driving. 

I've got a beginners knowledge of the electrical components of a car, so I don't know what the cable is even connecting to. It could be something as simple as the cable getting disconnected from a secure position (in fact as I'm writing this, I remember that the last time I replaced the battery, I had lowered it onto the positive terminal/cable at first), but I didnt want to take any action without consulting people with more knowledge.

1n5zit4,03 Sierra 2500HD Clock Spring Issue,"03 Sierra 2500HD 6.6L LBZ Allison 4x4 Crewcab

I have been working on making my steering wheel buttons work for a long while now. I pulled the trigger on another clock spring with the complete harness. Part is Standard CSP265. This states on Rockauto that it is for my truck that fits crewcab with steering wheel controls. This harness I order has an extra pigtail that I did not have on the original harness. Shown in attached pics. One of the pics shows the full original harness and the other is the installed new harness and the pigtail that I have no clue what to do with.

Can anyone tell where the harness plugs in or what it controls? I suspect this is why my steering wheel controls don't work because this harness is either not connected or I have ordered the wrong harness again. I'm my own worst enemy I swear.

When you pulled the spark plugs out that oil drained into the cylinder.
The smoke you got after starting the engine is that oil being burned off. It should clear up after a few minutes of the engine running.

You should replace the valve cover gaskets and tube seals it will come as a set.

If it's an ecotech 4 cyl with the plastic valve cover, I would recommend replacing the valve cover as an assembly it will have all the gaskets installed, and the pcv valve is incorporated into the valve cover.

1n5vrhk,How destroyed are my brakes?,"I realize this is bad, but just trying to get an idea of how bad. 

Just came back from a weekend trip out of town for a family reunion (700km drive there and 700km back). The brakes were acting up a bit before we left but I didn’t have a chance to get them serviced. The drive back was when things seemed really rough. 

This is a 2022 4Runner with 80,000km. I had a full brake job done at 60k, and then the rotors warped and the shop redid them under warranty at 70k. 

I’m assuming seized calliper on the right rear wheel, and I’ll need new calliper/pads/rotor. I have absolutely no mechanic knowledge or skills though and would really like some input. 

Does the back left look bad or alright?

I just used a manifold gauge to check pressures on my 2015 Mazda 3. Some weeks back I noticed a schrader valve leak in the low side port. Recharged the system myself using the proper refrigerant.

It was about 85-90 degrees (likely closer to 90) when I took these pressures with humidity around 65-70%.

AC seemed to have blown cold for a couple weeks after the recharge but is slowly blowing hotter as time goes on. I noticed my serpentine belt was frayed, so I just replaced that today as well.

1n5v039,Issues with car not wanting to start,I have a 2007 mustang v6 and it’s always had this problem where sometimes right after I turn it off it doesn’t want to start again. At first I thought I had a bad connection to the battery so I replaced the terminals and probably stopped for a bit and then came back. Next I replaced the battery and it stopped for a bit and came back. Not long after getting a brand new battery I was driving home and my headlights went out and all of my dash lights went out and then the car died and wouldn’t start at all even with  a jump. So I replaced the alternator and while the issue seemed to get better after that for about a month it started to come back. If I didn’t turn the lights off before I turned the car off it would need to be jumpstarted. If I left them on for even 10 seconds with the car being off it would need a jump so I thought maybe I got a bad alternator because I’ve tested the battery and it always comes back as good. 2 days ago I was driving home and the same thing that happened when the alternator went out the last time happened again lights all went out radio wouldn’t turn on and battery dash light came on. I replaced the 4 month old alternator and not even a day later I turned the car off and the headlights were still on for just a few seconds before I turned them off and the car wouldn’t start with a new alternator in it even. When it does this it will crank a few times like it wants to turn over but then it will just click really fast and then nothing. Anyone have any ideas of what could possibly be wrong or where or how I can start checking to figure out what is going on. I use my car for work and can’t have it dying on me every other time I turn it off and feel like I’m just throwing money I don’t have it chasing a problem I’m not fixing ,2,1756747739.0,19,MechanicAdvice,1756841549,2025-09-01 17:28:59,2025-09-02 19:32:29,"aberg59 (Score: 2): If you test the battery and alternator and verify that they are correct with a multimeter then I would check your battery cables going between the alternator and the battery, check for corrosion or any shorts.

1n5srx6,1965 Volvo 122 / Starting Issue,"Hey! New to the sub. With a little previous DIY motorcycle tinkering, I picked up a 1965 Volvo 122 “Amazon” about ten years ago. It was mostly original and had been sitting in storage for eight years previous. It ran when I got it and mostly worked fine for about a year. When stuff started failing, I tried tackling small stuff on my own, took it to a local shop for stuff I was uncomfortable with.

At some point it wouldn’t start. The shop rebuilt the carburetor, then it failed, so replaced the carburetor. The shop replaced the fuel pump. About a year later the fuel pump failed and the shop replaced it a second time.

It’s been about another year. I’ve been busy and haven’t driven it in a few months — I know that’s not great. Battery is charged. Car won’t start. Tried some starter fluid, still no go. It seems like it’ll turn over and consume the fuel/starter fluid I’m adding to the carbs, but then stalls. I’m assuming fuel is not getting to the carburetors.

1n63vdi,Troubles with replacing the CMP/CAM sensor,"Hello everyone!!!

I was driving my Honda pilot 2016 rlv while I was 100 miles from home down the highway and suddenly it stopped.  What I mean by stopped is the accelerator stopped working and I was soley relying on my leftover speed. I than pulled over on the side of the highway and awaited a tow truck to a mechanic. The mechanic is told me it could be the cam sensor or otherwise known as the ""CMP"" sensor In the service manual. I'll be referring to the cam sensor as the CMP sensor from now on. Long story short they thought it was going to be a easy fix but they sadly couldn't do it because they realized it would be a 4-5 hour job. I was already staying away from home for about 2 days at that point and I unfortunately towed my car back home. It sat for a while until I realized not having a car sucks. Time to fix it. The car will not start. 

Luckily we were able to find a video (link) of someone replacing the CMP sensor on YouTube along with the timing belt to. We watched it a few times and decided to start the repair. 

We Jacked the car
 removed the fender 
drained the coolant 
Disconnected the battery 
Removed one of those long holder rods.
Removed the drive train belt.
Open both view ports to see if engine at TDC 

The lower view port was just a cover for a bolt. Kind of strange.

Here presents the first major issue. As you looked inside the second viewport (the one that was higher up) nothing inside it was moving at all. We tired putting back on the drive belt and still nothing was moving inside that view port. We did a few other minor troubleshooting steps that aren't really relevant but nothing changed and the issue still persists.


No idea if this is true or not but I asked chat gpt and he said that I have a bad harmonic balancer and to verify that I do a test with a straw by putting it in the first spark plug and seeing if the straw moves up and down if it does than according to chat gpt my harmonic balancer is bad if it's not than it's something else. We never did the straw test 


At this point we were stuck. At the time we were following a mix of the video guide I mentioned before and the service manual. We decided to move  exclusively to the service manual.


The best course of action was to rent a OBD2 scanner. That's what we we did and out came one error code as far as I can tell. 


Before inserting the OBD2 scanner we put the drive belt back on and all other major components we took off bassicly undid everything.


The code is P0365. It indicates that the CMP sensor is bad bassicly. 


The service manual has nice troubleshooting steps to solve this it bassicly wants you to open the breaker boxes in the car and check if all the wiring is ok  if it's not than replaced the CMP sensor


The next major roadblock awaits us in the troubleshooting guide it tells you to open wire check (IGP line) and check for continuity. Where is this breaker that your supposed to check where is the IGP line box it provides no information about this what so over. Unless we get clarification on this we will have to continue with our current plan.


The current plan is to replace the CMP sensor we are going to ignore that the engine is at TDC and hope that the wires are ok and it's just the CMP sensor that's bad. 

So far we have removed the drive belt removed the two bolts from the tensisor(hopefully we removed the right ones) in the service manual they provided a atroucis diagram one is longer than the other and they go quite deep. The ones we pulled out are about the same size which concers me a bit. Not sure if you're actually supposed to remove that tensisor now to or not.)

now the next step is removing the harmonic balancer. 

To do that the service manual says to use a breaker bar and a rachet while everyone else uses a impact gun. I have no idea how they expect you to fit a breaker bar in there it's such a long unwieldy thing.


Recap 

Can not verify that the engine is at TDC because nothing moves as we rotate the harmonic balancer

Manual does not provide enough info to diagnose wires for the CMP sensor.

1n63sf8,Can't seem to get a clear reading on engine oil dipstick. Is this a sign of any problem?,"Car: 2017 Toyota Corolla

Miles: \~106,400 mi

Engine: 1.8L 4 cylinder standard engine

Bought this car back in April of this year with \~105,200 mi but I haven't kept up with checking the oil and all. I'm trying to be better with car maintenance and thought I should start with the engine oil. So, no one has touched the oil since then. No check engine light issues or anything.

the photos I attached are of both sides of the dipstick. According to the manual (also attached) I should warm up the engine, then wait 5+ minutes before checking the dipstick. I also made sure to wipe the dipstick with a clean cloth then re-insert and check again. I do this every time, but I still get this sloppy reading.

So, I've tried checking less than 10 minutes after shutting off the engine as well as 1+ hr after and still have the same problem. Only thing I haven't tried is checking in the morning when the engine has been off since the day before but that would be way different from what the manual says.

Btw I know the car is supposed to be level when doing this, but does it matter much if I'm on the street which is slightly curved? See my photo

Also I've also noticed my MPG has gradually decreased since April. Started at about 35.2 MPG and it's now at 32.9. It never goes up, only down. I live in NY btw. Hopefully this isn't also a sign of a larger problem.

Any advice appreciated

1n5qb1f,Update on car acceleration issue after fixing ATF levels,"Car: 2012 Mazda 3 2.0 Non Skyactiv

Context: car isn’t my daily driver and just got it a few days ago for $900 to see if I can fix it. It had TCM issues which I fixed and the codes cleared after. The guy who drove it to me forgot to tighten the oil cap so some of it splashed under the hood.

Previous symptoms: The car had trouble accelerating as it took 10 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 20mph and even worse uphill. Feel free to check my posts history for further context.

Actions performed: throttle body cleaning, checked spark plugs, ATF levels fixed.

Result: the rough idling became more pronounced honestly after I messed with the air box and the coils. However, fixing the ATF fluid got the transmission relatively better and the acceleration from 0 to 20 became 3.5 seconds.

Current symptoms: when I put in drive and without pressing the gas pedal, the car is a little jerky. When it’s idling the engine, and the air box are shaking extending to the inside of the car as well. No codes from the OBD. The CAT temperature seems to be around 350 C after driving it for 10 minutes. Some white smoke coming out of the exhaust manifold shield which I thought was oil splash getting burnt.


What do you think is the best course of action to address the jerkiness I described? 



Thanks everyone who brought my attention to fixing the ATF fluid. I only noticed it after fixing the TCM which was what the codes were initially for. I didn’t drive it for more than 7 miles myself but the previous owner certainly did at least 100 with the car in this condition.

I have been looking for used cars on marketplace, OfferUp but I have no clue about how to go about it and don’t really know cars too well. After some research (and feel free to correct me if im wrong), some green flags when buying a car include a clean title, low miles, reliable brands (Toyota, Honda) and looking up vin numbers to see accident history. I also have seen people use obd2 scanners when they meet to look up the computer for any problems? I am currently looking at a 2017 Honda accord 56k miles clean title for about 12k. The seller is somewhat trustworthy, he is my girlfriend’s neighbor and her dad (pretty car savvy) bought his car from him. When I go see the car, anything I should do specifically? From some videos I’ve seen, people recommend hard acceleration tests, hard brake tests, etc. Are there any questions I should ask, any things to do with the car, what to look for? Would anyone recommend buying a obd2 scanner? Thank you so much in advance for the advice! If there are any missing key parts, please let me know.

Additionally, what should I do with my old car? Check engine light came on, and after taking it to autozone for a test, it looks like it’s a transmission problem. I don’t mind just getting rid of the headache and selling it as a junk car for a few hundred bucks, but if there is a better way to go about it to consider.

The cap comes off/goes on by pushing down with the palm of your hand and turning it. 

The other coolant reservoir is called the overflow. Because this is a pressurized system (when hot), some coolant will normally be pushed out due to expansion. That pushed out coolant goes to the overflow tank, which holds it. Once the system cools down again, that bit of coolant gets sucked back into the system. That being said, the overflow tank should always have some coolant in it. There are usually lines in the side of the tank marked ""hot"" and ""cold"" or sometimes ""add"". The overflow tank is also not under pressure and can be opened at any time, unlike the radiator pressure cap marked with yellow. Hope this helps!"

I have been keeping up with the repair work and am on time for the oil changes. I just got my brakes replaced last year, along with new tires. I went to O'Reilly's Auto Parts for a cabin filter on Saturday, August 30th, due to the fact that I was smelling some type of burning. I was able to get that replaced, but afterwards I noticed a loud noise, along with vibrating. I ended up taking it to Firestone, and they told me that due to leaf debris(which a lot of leaves ended up falling through the cabin filter). 

They told me that eventually the noise would go away. They also changed the blower due to it being old. Now today, the engine light popped up, and I got it taken to Autozone, and they ran a test, and it's the purge canister valve. Well, I plan to get that replaced tomorrow at Firestone. I completely have no issues with them as they've always been honest. I am still hearing buzzing in the AC see attached video). So I have them replacing the Purge Valve, but they will be having one of the master technicians look at the buzzing noise.

• spare tire he had brought was a very rusty tire that i doubted would even get me home. i was terrified the wheel was going to come off because of how bad my steering wheel was rattling while driving with it.

• i am forced to drive with said sad rusty tire for a week until my new set of tires came in. my total drive to and from work is over an hour. it is not fun being constantly scared that i am going to crash with this awful tire.

• when my new tires comes in my dad only then tells me that my spare tire is an inch too small (15 inches) while my other tires are 16 inches. i sigh because i have a gut feeling other parts in my car are now damaged because he doesn't inform me hardly anything about what he is doing to my car, but i have no other option because i am in poverty.

• new tires drive fine, but of course a few weeks later my steering wheel starts to vibrate sometimes and sometimes my front left tire sounds like it's creaking and thudding. 

• i go and get my front tires balanced at discount tire since it's free hoping it'll fix the issue but it doesn't. my steering wheel still vibrates and front left tire creaks.

so what kind of damage could my dad have done to my car continuously putting bad tires on it? i suspect it's probably whatever's holding the tire (idk what it's called) or some other crap i'm gonna have to fork more money i don't have to fix an issue that started with tires that should've been put on in the first place.",2,1756690554.0,2,CarHelp,1756841549,2025-09-01 01:35:54,2025-09-02 19:32:29,"shaggy24200 (Score: 1): This isn't your dad's fault.

1n5vovf,HELP! Removing Broken Fuel Injector from 2011 BMW X3 35i Drive N55 Engine,"Hi,

I Neeeeed Help!

Backstory: I've been stuck on this for about a month and a half! To start, my 2011 BMW X3 was having issues running/idling/in limp mode, so I started going down the diagnostic list. I have an Autel system reader, and I used it to check all my sensors and metrics to see if there were any issues, as well as checked other parts that I've had issues with in the past. I noticed I was having fuel issues, and replaced my high-pressure fuel pump (also replaced it last summer as it was faulty then), and the car still wasn't running right. I also have had issues with the valvetronic solenoids in the past, so I cleaned them in an ultrasonic cleaner and did a fresh oil change. After doing this, I still had issues, so I pulled the spark plugs (probably should've done this first) and as you can see in the pictures, 2 of them were donzo! The 2 that were the worst were cylinders 5 and 6. I then replaced all 6, and my car still was in limp mode (blinking engine light, drivetrain malfunction with knock codes/misfires and fuel injection shut off). I started doing some research online and testing on my car, and I found the weather stripping or Cowl / Weather Seal Leak in my car's engine bay is damaging, causing rainwater to fall and pool on cylinders 5 and 6.. (Supposedly, this issue is common enough that there's even a BMW TSB #B641019 on this)

Today: I started pulling injectors on cylinders 1 and 6 to compare (using the BMW special injector puller tool), and you can see how corroded the injector on cylinder 6 is. I then went to pull the injector on cylinder number 5... and the head of the injector broke off the rest of the injector.. I've been trying for weeks to get this injector out, but nothing has worked so far. I've tried a slind hammer, a vice grip slide hammer, welding a bolt onto the body of the injector (to have something to grab onto), welding threads onto the body of the injector to continue using the special tool, map gas, and too much penetrating oil. My second-to-last effort was to create a collet-like grabbing tool to squeeze onto the injector while giving me something to pull from (shown in picture), but still nothing.

I'm not sure what to do anymore. I'm out of ideas. So I thought I would make a post here since I really, really don't want to pull the head off and was hoping someone out there has a different idea, perspective, method, or something that would work.

I attached a bunch of images of what the injectors look like, what they're supposed to look like, tools I've used, old ignition coils, and the broken injector.

Thank you, thank you in advance for any and all ideas! Please LMK if you need any more images, videos, codes, information, or anything! Sorry for any grammar issues, as I am writing this after another frustrating, wasted 4 hours.

speedo0522 (Score: 1): What a nightmare.  A seized and broken injector in 6 cylinders on a BMW is unfortunately pretty common when there’s water intrusion from the cowl seal leak. Once the injector corrodes into the head, galvanic corrosion plus carbon build-up, and it glued in.  You  can try drill the core out now and fit a tapper to remove.  It may not work.  Some garages actually mill the injector out with custom cutters (head on car), then clean the bore and fit a sleeve/insert kit if the seat is damaged. If none of this works, it becomes a head off job."

1n63udf,Troubles with replacing CMP/CAM sensor,"Hello everyone!!!

I was driving my Honda pilot 2016 rlv 6 cylinder while I was 100 miles from home down the highway and suddenly it stopped.  What I mean by stopped is the accelerator stopped working and I was soley relying on my leftover speed. I than pulled over on the side of the highway and awaited a tow truck to a mechanic. The mechanic is told me it could be the cam sensor or otherwise known as the ""CMP"" sensor In the service manual. I'll be referring to the cam sensor as the CMP sensor from now on. Long story short they thought it was going to be a easy fix but they sadly couldn't do it because they realized it would be a 4-5 hour job. I was already staying away from home for about 2 days at that point and I unfortunately towed my car back home. It sat for a while until I realized not having a car sucks. Time to fix it. The car will not start. 

Luckily we were able to find a video (link) of someone replacing the CMP sensor on YouTube along with the timing belt to. We watched it a few times and decided to start the repair. 

We Jacked the car
 removed the fender 
drained the coolant 
Disconnected the battery 
Removed one of those long holder rods.
Removed the drive train belt.
Open both view ports to see if engine at TDC 

The lower view port was just a cover for a bolt. Kind of strange.

Here presents the first major issue. As you looked inside the second viewport (the one that was higher up) nothing inside it was moving at all. We tired putting back on the drive belt and still nothing was moving inside that view port. We did a few other minor troubleshooting steps that aren't really relevant but nothing changed and the issue still persists.


No idea if this is true or not but I asked chat gpt and he said that I have a bad harmonic balancer and to verify that I do a test with a straw by putting it in the first spark plug and seeing if the straw moves up and down if it does than according to chat gpt my harmonic balancer is bad if it's not than it's something else. We never did the straw test 


At this point we were stuck. At the time we were following a mix of the video guide I mentioned before and the service manual. We decided to move  exclusively to the service manual.


The best course of action was to rent a OBD2 scanner. That's what we we did and out came one error code as far as I can tell. 


Before inserting the OBD2 scanner we put the drive belt back on and all other major components we took off bassicly undid everything.


The code is P0365. It indicates that the CMP sensor is bad bassicly. 


The service manual has nice troubleshooting steps to solve this it bassicly wants you to open the breaker boxes in the car and check if all the wiring is ok  if it's not than replaced the CMP sensor


The next major roadblock awaits us in the troubleshooting guide it tells you to open wire check (IGP line) and check for continuity. Where is this breaker that your supposed to check where is the IGP line box it provides no information about this what so over. Unless we get clarification on this we will have to continue with our current plan.


The current plan is to replace the CMP sensor we are going to ignore that the engine is at TDC and hope that the wires are ok and it's just the CMP sensor that's bad. 

So far we have removed the drive belt removed the two bolts from the tensisor(hopefully we removed the right ones) in the service manual they provided a atroucis diagram one is longer than the other and they go quite deep. The ones we pulled out are about the same size which concers me a bit. Not sure if you're actually supposed to remove that tensisor now to or not.)

now the next step is removing the harmonic balancer. 

To do that the service manual says to use a breaker bar and a rachet while everyone else uses a impact gun. I have no idea how they expect you to fit a breaker bar in there it's such a long unwieldy thing.


Recap 

Can not verify that the engine is at TDC because nothing moves as we rotate the harmonic balancer

Manual does not provide enough info to diagnose wires for the CMP sensor.

2. Where do I start? As I am new I’m not sure what to do first? The transmission is completely bolted up all that’s left is on the list and swapping the ECU, gave me all parts needed and the keys/ignition to the accord and Acura.

This is a sub more geared around CAN bus and control system hacks, so probably won't find much

and generally I doubt you'll find someone who's experienced with this kind of swap.

1) People generally don't want to lower the value of their car - This is a rare sportscar, with a killer high revving engine absolutely adored by the honda guys. Most people looking to buy an S2000 would hate the idea of it being an automatic. 

2) The swap will be painful - Physically - Manuals are smaller than autos, and the S2000 was engineered only as a manual. There probably isn't space in the tunnel for the automatic and the crossmembers and exhaust and things around the bottom of the transmission are even more likely to cause clearance problems.  
You won't be able to find an automatic shifting mechanism. That will all need to be built or adapted from a different car

3) The swap will be painful - Electrically/calibrations - The F20C engine is only used in the S2000, which means it was only ever calibrated for a manual. That means you can't adapt the transmission control from another car to suit your setup. You would need to go full aftermarket (Modern automatics have a lot of ECU <-> TCU coms and coordination).  
The engine also revs north of 8,600RPM from the factory, so to calibrate the shift map and shift performance of the autos to suit an engine with very unique torque delivery would be a lot of work. OEMs spend maybe a full year with a dedicated and experienced team calibrating a new engine/transmission combination.

4) The end result would suck. Given the challenges above, you'll end up with a car that has customised body, crossmembers, tail shaft, shifter, all things that are not durability tested. Driveability would suck, because you just can't spend the time getting the auto to work well. High revving engines tend to feel bad on automatics anyway; lots of gear hunting and acceleration lag. It'd be expensive because the entire driveline controls would be aftermarket and custom.

Don't pay someone to do this."

1n6449b,Can someone explain the difference between various ignition systems?,"I ride a motorcycle and drive a car and would like to know various ignition systems and understand which type is used by which. I watched some videos and read articles on the history of ignition systems but I still cant clearly differentiate various types of ignition system eg magnetos, coils on plug, CDI, distributors etc
",1,1756769347.0,7,AskMechanics,1756841549,2025-09-01 23:29:07,2025-09-02 19:32:29,"xXCodfishXx (Score: 2): Well I'm sure someone here can give a more detailed explanation but the ignition system has two functions- to convert the \~12v battery current into high voltage current which can jump the air gap in the spark plug, and to ensure that that current goes to the right cylinder at the right time (i.e. beginning of power stroke.)

The first function is (usually) achieved by the ignition coil, which is just a transformer (what a transformer is exactly is outside of the scope of auto mechanics, but that question can be easily found on the internet.) Now you mention magnetos and CDI. Magnetos are archaic technology so I can't really give much info on that, but it hasn't been relevant for about a hundred years. CDI simply uses a capacitor inline with a triggering circuit and a small transformer to generate the same high voltage. It has certain advantages, especially for small high revving engines because it can charge faster with a smaller battery. Either way the point of the coil (IDI) or the CDI unit is the same- generate high voltage to make spark.

The second function, the timing, is achieved either using a distributor or computer controlled ignition (coil on plug, or coil pack ignition). Distributors are the older system because they were developed before computer controlled ignitions. The only use a single ignition coil, and the distributor 'distributes' this high voltage to each plug. It's pretty simple- the distributor spins based on a connection to the camshaft (so it is in time with the engine), and the distributor cap has one wire coming from the coil in the center, and around it wires going to each spark plug. The rotor on top of the distributor and inside of the cap bridges a connection between the coil and the correct plug when that cylinder is at top dead center. It also needs to use a device to trigger the coil each time but that's a whole 'nother tangent. [This](https://www.thedrive.com/guides-and-gear/ignition-upgrades-explained-points-vs-electronic-vs-msd) article explains it well. Looking up an exploded diagram may help you understand it better. Now this systems works pretty well, but the distributor cap and rotor need to be replaced regularly and there's no way to really fine tune ignition timing in a dynamic way. So, as engines became more computer controlled, coil on plug or coil pack ignition was invented. COP and CPI is basically the same thing, except with COP the coil literally sits on top of the plug, where as with CPI the coil is mounted near the plug with a short wire connecting it (usually on the head, or in bikes mounted to the frame.) The way this system works is also pretty simple, just with more computer control, and with a coil for every cylinder/plug. The crankshaft position sensor reads the position of the crankshaft to tell the engine computer (ECU) where the engine in timing, and each coil gets 12v from the battery and a trigger signal from the ECU (which is typically a ground interrupt.) So when for instance cylinder 1 is at top dead center, the ECU reads this from the CPS, and then interrupts the ground going to the cylinder 1 coil, which causes a high voltage to rapidly travel through the spark plug the coil is connected to. This system is prevalent in all passenger cars these days because it allows for better ignition timing, and it makes it easier for the ECU to detect misfires.

I hope this was accurate and informative.

1n63mwm,Can't seem to get a clear reading on engine oil dipstick. Is this a sign of any problem?,"Car: 2017 Toyota Corolla

Miles: \~106,400 mi

Engine: 1.8L 4 cylinder standard engine

Bought this car back in April of this year with \~105,200 mi but I haven't kept up with checking the oil and all. I'm trying to be better with car maintenance and thought I should start with the engine oil. So, no one has touched the oil since then. No check engine light issues or anything.

the photos I attached are of both sides of the dipstick. According to the manual (also attached) I should warm up the engine, then wait 5+ minutes before checking the dipstick. I also made sure to wipe the dipstick with a clean cloth then re-insert and check again. I do this every time, but I still get this sloppy reading.

So, I've tried checking less than 10 minutes after shutting off the engine as well as 1+ hr after and still have the same problem. Only thing I haven't tried is checking in the morning when the engine has been off since the day before but that would be way different from what the manual says.

Btw I know the car is supposed to be level when doing this, but does it matter much if I'm on the street which is slightly curved? See my photo

Also I've also noticed my MPG has gradually decreased since April. Started at about 35.2 MPG and it's now at 32.9. It never goes up, only down. I live in NY btw. Hopefully this isn't also a sign of a larger problem.

Any advice appreciated

 follow the Negative battery cable to the body connection and also to the engine connection.. on my later 96 E250 4.9.. the negative battery cable attaches to the bottom bolt mounting the starter.. it will crank crazy slow if that was left off. 

 i have not worked on an 86 in a long long time.  

 do you have a set of jumper cables..   hook the black jumper cable to the Negative battery post.. hook the black battery cable clamp to a good spot on the engine..  see if it cranks faster..  if it does then there is an issue with the Negative battery connection to the engine.. been there a few times..

I have a 2005 Chrysler Sebring and as I was driving on the highway it suddenly stopped giving gas, I was pressing the pedal and nothing was happening. Naturally I immediately pulled to the side of the road, turned off the car, and tried to start it again. When it didn’t start I got out and opened the hood where I saw cool and spraying everywhere from the top. I since then let the car fully cool and have tried a number of times to turn on the car. The electrics such as the radio, lights, speakers, everything but when I push the key further all I get is one click and the engine will not turn over. I’m not sure what to do.

We did (unsuccessfully), but when he was checking the cables he briefly shorted my battery to check if the cables were making contact with my battery. It was momentary, and I wasn’t too worried about it (though I wish he asked if that was okay first), but I decided to take a look at my battery later, and I noticed two things:

1) When I got out of the car in my driveway before taking a look at the battery, I noticed an eggy smell. I drove the car around the block a bit later, and didn’t notice the smell again, so maybe it was a passing fart and not the battery, but that had me worried.

2) There’s corrosion on the hold down bar. I understand that corrosion forms at the terminals, but it seems weird to be on the hold down bar.


Everything is working fine, and I couldn’t replicate that eggy smell, so I’m not sure if it even came from the car or not.

I also noticed when unlocking the car, no lights would come on (e.g. no DRLs, no rear lights, no interior lights). I have this connected to FordPass, and I was checking that out a few hours after I arrived after the 150mi trip, and it said remote connectivity was disabled because the car was in battery saver mode.

Off of the back of that, I asked my in-laws if I could borrow a multimeter. With the car on, engine not running, the battery was at 11.4V. When the engine was on it was up at 14V (from my understanding, this would mean the alternator is okay?)

A couple of days later I drove back home, so another 150mi, 3h30m~ish journey. Overall since I got it I've probably driven it for about 8h30m or so. I've still received a couple of notifications while at home from FordPass saying it's in battery saver mode, and it's still never activated stop/start.

I've called the dealership I bought the car from and let them know, and they're going to ring me back to get booked in with them to test it. I just want to go in with some degree of knowledge.

* Is this battery totally on it's way out? Or is it still possible that it just needed a full charge and could be okay?
* Given the above, if they test it, is it likely they should be able to identify that it is on it's way out (if it is), and agree to replace it straight away?
* If the battery is on it's way out, am I risking overworking the alternator? Is what I've already driven a problem?

I don't like the idea of this causing other issues, so just want to get it sorted ASAP. If they're going to drag their feet, I'll get it sorted myself, so just want to know!

Things were great for a while, then one day it just stopped starting. We didn’t get the click noise that the bad starter gave us, just no attempt to start at all.

1n5svhn,Brake Job From Hell - Can't rotate wheel by hand in neutral,"Hey guys. I'm having a hell of a time trying to change my girlfriend's brake pads up here in the sticks of New Hampshire. Her car is a 2022 Subaru Outback Limited. We've been on the first wheel since 8am this morning.

**Our first attempt:** To start, we jacked up the car, removed the driver's side front tire, removed the caliper bolts that go into the slide pins, removed the caliper and hung it with a bungee cord, removed the old brake pads and clips, removed and re-silicone pasted the slide pins, used sand paper to scuff up the existing rotors, installed new clips, installed new brake pads, opened brake fluid reservoir, used c-clamp and old pad to push caliper pistons back in, reinstalled the brake fluid reservoir cap, re-installed the caliper over the new brake pads, tightened the caliper bolts to 20ft lbs and then installed the tire. We turned the car on, pumped the brake pedal until there was resistance, then put the car in neutral. I spun the driver's side front tire and it was squeaking badly. 

**Our first diagnosis:** the new clips provided with the Autozone Duralast Gold Brake Pads were slightly larger and rubbing the rotor's outside perimeter. We removed the clips and reinstalled the old factory clips that came with the car. Reinstalled the new pads, depressed the caliper pistons again, and then reinstalled the caliper. We started the car, pumped the brake pedal, put it in neutral, and I cannot spin the wheel hub. I put the tire on and tried with the tire for extra leverage and nothing - it wont spin.

**Our next diagnosis:** I removed the tire, removed the caliper, removed the slide pins - cleaned and re-silicone pasted them. We turned the car on and put it in neutral. I verified I could spin the wheel without the caliper on it with the new pads. We turned the car off, pushed the caliper pistons back in, then we put the caliper back on - turned the car on, pumped the brakes, and put the car in neutral - nothing - we can't spin in.

I pushed the brake rotor backing plate back, applied brake lube to the back side of the brake pads that interface with the caliper, etc. Nothing is working. Does anyone have any ideas on what is wrong? Can I not reuse the old clips with the new pads?

Side note: Yes, we know that she definitely needs new rotors. We just can't afford them right now and will be replacing them next spring! Unfortunately her pads can't wait until then too.

I followed the DENSO instructions to rotate the compressor 10+ times to release the oil in the head that it was supposedly shipped with. There was no oil, and it required a wrench to turn the compressor shaft which would seize slightly during rotation sort of like the resistance you get when rotating a crank shaft during a timing chain replacement. I wasn’t aware that was abnormal. Since there was no oil I added 8oz of pag 46 to the compressor before installation.

As I was charging the system the compressor  kicked on and made the same racket that the old compressor was making before I removed it. I continued charging and the noise eased off but never completely went away. I ran the AC for a day before the truck started running strange and I could smell something burning.

I decided to check the AC and did more research on line. I wasn’t aware that these units should turn easily by hand with just a little resistance. 

Anyway, I ordered another compressor and started switching them out this morning. The new compressor, same model DENSO, rotates easily by hand, but also has no oil in it despite DENSO claiming these units are shipped with oil in them. 

I then went to check how much oil to put in the new unit by seeing how much oil was in the defective unit. There was no oil in it. Where did the oil go? I had added 8ozs to it, so it has to be in the other components. Why is there none in the compressor?

They advised me to go VW service and after paying $180 diagnostic, they weren’t able to 100% say what the issue was without doing a deeper diagnostic that would cost more.

The issue: My engine has been doing this on and off for 1 year now. While stopped, the car revs constantly as shown in this video I just took. In the beginning, the car would shake as well. And a few times, the engine completely shut down while I was stopped at a red light, and I had to restart my ignition. Scary thing to happen on the road. But then for several months the car was fine. And now, it’s starting to rev more and more while stopped.

At this point, I don’t have much faith in someone being able to diagnose the issue after spending a lot of time at different mechanics to no avail - and I need a reliable car so I’m considering selling this to Carvana or something so I can get some cash for a down payment and pickup a used Mazda3 or something for the time being.

It just dawned on me why it's so freaking dusty. I work at a cement factory. The factory spews out dust. Our cars are always covered in thin layer of dust. On top of this, our truck terminal is a gravel parking lot and very dusty. I thought having a car wash pass would keep my car clean. Yeah, it does on the outside. But apparently dust can get under the hood, and even under the engine cover. Fortunately, I change my air and cabin filter regularly at the oil change place. But I've been working at the cement factory for 8 years. Has this dust infiltrated my engine beyond the filter? I mean, for example, the electrical componentry, etc. My 2013 2.0
liter Soul only has 60k on it. I figured this will be my last car since I'm in my 60s.

My question comes in here.  Technically my 0.03 is >0 so it should be “fine” according to what I read on the web, but since the caliper is a big chunk of aluminum and brakes get hot - how much expansion could I expect from the caliper?

This is mostly straight forward but the last bullet point is vague. I have no idea what is considered an extended period. Like don't go on a road trip? Don't go on the highway for longer than a minute? If I'm stuck in traffic going 5mph for 30 minutes is that bad? Is highway driving OK for short distances?

1n60qvb,"Would you avoid a car with ""unknown mileage"" on MOT history? G30 BMW","Hey guys,

I’m currently looking at buying a G30 5 Series. I came across a car and went through its MOT history.

One thing that worried me: on one of the MOT entries, the mileage is listed as “unknown” instead of an actual number. This is a bit of a common problem with other G30s as well.

I know MOT history is one of the main ways to verify mileage on UK cars, so I’m wondering:

Is this usually a red flag (possible clocking, dodgy history)?

Would you personally avoid a car with this in its history, even if the service records looked consistent?

And how would it affect the resale value when it comes time to sell the car?

1) might be worth joining MB owners club. You get a discount on original parts, plus the wealth of knowledge on maintenance and repair. You may also benefit from discounted insurance, many insurers have a list of recognised clubs, so you don’t even have to buy through the club. 

2) find a local specialist to do the work or learn to do it yourself. I had one guy who was amazing and another who was very much ADHD, did good work but hard to keep focused. 

3) rust if it isn’t an issue already will be soon, Mercedes don’t rust much until they do after which it develops fast. I recommend looking at some kind of undersealing. 

4) watch out for the upholstery. It might look like leather but it might not be. Mercedes is famed for its MB TEX, a very desirable, extremely high quality vinyl that looks just like real leather. Figure out what you have before buying the appropriate products for it, but remember MB TEX will stand a lot more abuse but may not hold up to some chemicals that are in leather conditioner."

I’m looking for a car for a daily work commute of about 150 km total, and I’m torn between two options:

2004 VW Golf 1.9 SDI diesel – 290k km, €1400
2004 Volvo S40 1.8 petrol – 250k km, €1700

Both have a full service history, timing belt kits replaced, and no visible rust.

I’ve owned similar cars before (a MK3 Golf instead of a MK4). The Golf was a huge disappointment (constant oil leaks, squeaky engine), though to be fair, it had no service history. On the other hand, my old S40 gave me zero issues but was a heavy drinker (I mostly drove in city/rural areas, and I had a heavy foot back then).

Given my bad experience with VW, I’m leaning toward the Volvo. However, when I ran the numbers, the leftover from my work fuel reimbursement would be:

220€/month with the Golf
50€/month with the Volvo

I have no idea if that €220 cushion with the Golf would realistically cover potential extra expenses. Keep in mind, the key factor for me is reliability. My current car is a 2003 Toyota Yaris, but its 1.0 engine probably won’t handle the highway very well.

But these cars really do not like regular city driving, as soon as they started using it for shorter commutes only, it needed a new inlet manifold and the EGR valves got clogged up. The constant start stop, both from the traffic but also the start stop button, puts excess strain on the timing chain as well. At the mileage it's currently at, it's unlikely to cause any major problems any time soon but you can never speak in absolutes when it comes to used cars. 

That 23k oil change interval isn't exactly ideal though imo, but that would be a much bigger concern if it happened at a higher mileage

Whether it's worth it or not is up to you, personally I think you can get a similar Golf or Japanese car for less money with similar spec. Some of the £13k is because it's auto (in fairness the auto boxes in these are good) but also just because it's a BMW (and not a sporty one at that).

I’m eyeing this 2008 Ford Focus automatic listed for £3,300, advertised as having low mileage (around 60,000 mi). On the surface, it looks like a decent deal—but before I pull the trigger, I’d love to hear your thoughts.

Here’s what I’m considering:

⸻

** Considerations**:
	•	Automatic Transmission: These can fetch a small premium in the UK due to rarity, but some older automatics may have reliability concerns.
	•	Low Mileage is always a perk—especially if it comes with a solid service history and MOTs.
	•	Model Trim & Spec: A Titanium or higher trim could justify a bit more, especially if it has desirable extras.
	•	Condition & Maintenance: Check for rust (common in these years), engine smoothness, fluid leaks, and make sure it has a cambelt and service records.  ￼ ￼
	•	Market Trends: The Focus is being phased out by mid-2025, which might lead to a price bump due to nostalgia/demand.  ￼
	•	Alternative Budget Picks: The Focus is praised for affordability and practicality, but others like the Fiesta, Corsa, or Kia may offer better value under £5k.  ￼

⸻

	•	Go for this listing if it’s in excellent condition with documented history?
	•	Hold out for something around £2,000–£2,500, or
	•	Consider a different model altogether?

1n5krch,Where PitSync users spent money on their vehicles in August,"Sharing a quick snapshot of where PitSync users spent on their vehicles in August, covering fuel, finance, insurance, and servicing. It reports out-of-pocket running costs only and excludes vehicle purchases.

**TL;DR** 

* Average spend per vehicle: **£307**
* Median: **£210**
* 80% of vehicles: **£50–£700**
* Highest single-vehicle month: **£2,224.45** (mix of service, fuel, other)

**Category snapshots**

* **Finance Payment** (median): **£261.06**
* **Insurance**: 
   * **78%** pay monthly (avg **£113.61**); 
   * **22%** pay yearly (avg **£746.19**); 
   * highest yearly premium logged: **£1,884/year**
* **Fuel (cost per refill - not monthly): £48.88** (median **£49.60**); **62%** full tanks vs **38%** top-ups
* Behaviour: **25.7%** spent only on fuel; **47.1%** logged no fuel (just bills/other)

**Finance types** *(finance payments only; purchase excluded; split within typed finance = 100%)*

* **HP:** **16.2%** · median **£239.60**
* **Personal loan:** **23.7%** · median **£165.54** 
* *Coverage note: finance sub-type tagging began mid-August, so this split is based on a limited typed sample. Treat as indicative. Due to this, PCP is bit higher than HP and sub-type medians may differ slightly from the overall finance median (****£261.06****).*

**Why August’s average (£307) is lower than July’s £491**  
We widened the cohort and lowered the inclusion floor to **£20** per vehicle to capture light-spend months. Same out-of-pocket scope; vehicle purchase excluded.

**Caveats**

* covers PitSync users only; self-reported logs skew toward cost-aware users.

I really cant do another day off taking it to Ford to resolve as I work for myself so a day is maybe 300 and im pretty light on cash as it is.

The reason I ask is because (in the nicest possible way), are you, who is spending £30k on a car, REALLY going to notice paying more for the fuel in a M340i Touring which has one of the best engines BMW have ever made?

That's my only feedback, as 15 years ago, I bought a 330D rather than a 330i - when I was doing high mileage (25k per year). The difference was that I filled it every 6 days, rather than every 5 days. At the price I was paying, the fuel price difference was negligible when you factor in insurance and depreciation.

1n5gdr9,How bad for a car is sustained high speed driving?,"I'm currently in Austria after having made the journey down from south west England. I travelled down in mk4 mx5 and my mate travelled down in a 320d. Whilst travelling through Germany we obviously encountered derestricted autobahns, and obviously as we are car enthusiasts and it was a quiet Sunday morning we absolutely blasted down those derestricted sections, we both topped out about 130mph however for the most part we were going 110mph.

Obviously this consumed more fuel than a soviet jetliner (I was getting about 8mpg at one point) but what is the actual mechanical toll on a car travelling at this speed, there were a couple of points where I was accelerating in 5th gear and was at just over 7k rpm for decent period of time and it just felt extremely taxing on the car.",171,1756704740.0,137,CartalkUK,1756841549,2025-09-01 05:32:20,2025-09-02 19:32:29,"Indignant_Woodlouse (Score: 274): Sustained high rpms and wide open throttle can be hard on an engine but to be honest I wouldn't generally worry about a modern engine especially a Mazda engine as long as it is well looked after.
Oil quality is everything.

Generally also ""lugging"" an engine at very low rpms but wide throttle is worse for it than being near the redline due to high cylinder pressures but lower oil pressure.

It's probably done it some good and got rid of some carbon and cleaned your cat out!

LukasDW (Score: 113): If the engine is in good condition and has sufficient and correct oil then you won't have any issues. Your revs go that high for a reason. 


As long as you're not bouncing the redline constantly I don't know why you think you're doing anything your car isn't designed to do.

robbersdog49 (Score: 46): If the cars are in good condition and were up to temperature the wear is probably not as bad as you think. The main issue with this kind of driving will be heat. Be it bearings, brakes, the engine, everything is stressed but as long as it's not over heating you should be fine. 

If you were doing this daily you'd probably want to lower the distance between oil changes, but as a one of like you've described won't be a problem. A good Italian tune can do wonders for an engine!"

1n5ayp1,"How is VED Road Tax, ULEZ and C02 allied to imported cars?","I'm interested in importing a jdm car.
My question is specifically regarding how VED, ULEZ and it's co2 is worked out.

I'll be interested in the Honda Fit/Jazz, and the Honda Vezel/HR-V both in automatic flavours. Open to either petrol or hybrid depending on what's cheaper in terms of road tax.
Maybe even a cheaky Kei car like the Honda N Box. All will be 2015/17 reg. 

Also, does the dah need to be converted if I buy a 2015 reg car next year in 2026? I know there's something about cars older than 10yrs don't need to have the speedometer converted to mph. 

I tried looking at auto trader import listings and checking the Running cost break down part of the adverts. Some just don't have tax listed, others show very high, some very low. I asked a few sellers on ebay, only one replied stating tax on a N Box was 220£ which I find very high for a 0.6ltr.


I thought I'd post here for advice from those more experienced in the field.

Type approval.

iVA. 

For grey imports where there's a UK accepted type approval certificate or certificate of conformity you can get from the manufacturer it will have the emissions data on there and the tax/ulez will be set on that and the date of manufacture. (I.e. if it's a 2016 car it will be co2 based, if it's a 2018 it will be the standard rate)



If you can't get that, and it's quite difficult for some manufacturers, you will need to get an individual vehicle approval and you can choose to get an acceptable emissions test. If you go the emissions test route they should be able to prove ulez and will tax it based what the tax system was the year of manufacture. Otherwise, and this is far more common, it will be taxed based on engine size like pre-2000ish cars and it will be automatically uncomplient with ulez.


Slight warning that it's a nightmare to change if you don't do it at original registration."

When it comes to maintenance, you have to remember all cars cost money to maintain with a significant amount portion of the upkeep being spent on labour so whilst the parts may be higher for a car of this calibre, and you may need to be stricter with the up keep, what you get in return in terms of enjoyment will be better value for money than a 2l diesel.

Edit: As with all used cars, you need to check the car over in person, look at the maintenance records from servicing, MOT, and other expenditures which may not have been strictly required to as it will give you somewhat of an insight in how the car has been treated.

1n5a7rs,Looking to get id3 on salary sacrifice,"Well I recently posted my car was cat n written off and I’ve decided I’ll just take the payout and get a new car. Now I’m deciding what car to get next, right now I’m leaning towards leasing a vw id3 match pure (pan roof) on salary sacrifice through work. The main thing is I don’t have a drive but there is a local 11kw charger down the road which is 48p/kwh. Now I know people say you don’t keep the car after the lease but my reasoning behind it is because my insurance is likely to be 2.5-3k now, the lease is 2 years and is about £370 per month which includes the car, insurance, maintenance, service and tyres. So in total it would be 8.8k. But if I buy a car insurance alone could cost around 5k across the 2 years and I’d have to get a car less than 3.8k to match the total cost of the lease and at that price I’d imagine maintenance and all would rack up even more costs so I’m wondering if it is a wise idea to get the electric car especially since I don’t have a drive. Keep in mind I do live in London and I have coworkers who mention that it’s doable.
