So I’m on a road trip around Australia and had a breakdown, turned out to be a faulty fuel injector so got it replaced with a new one. 

When I drove away from the mechanic I checked under the bonnet to have a look and there was smoke coming from the injector (see video)

Took it back to the mechanic and they said it was excess fuel burning off and after a drive it would seal itself better and be fine. 

I believed them, so drove off, 10mins later car wouldn’t accelerate properly so I pulled over and there was oil sprayed everywhere. (See photos) 

This is definitely due to an incorrect installation of the injector right?

1omtyys,2005 Ford F-150 King Ranch | Issues w/ Rear Door Wiring,"Hi everyone,

My parents have a 2005 Ford F-150 King Ranch, but the truck has an issue with wiring to the rear door (driver side)… unfortunately, the wire is causing the warning that the doors are open.

I’ve tested the doors with 12V probe. The faulty wire is on the rear door (driver side), but here are no visible issues with the wire. Where does this wire connect to within the truck for further troubleshooting? I’m assuming that the wire will need to be replaced.

1omtg4x,1999 F-150 stuck on the side of the road,"I have a 1999 f-150 v6 4.2L.

Less than a year ago, my fuel pump went out and I replaced it. Before I changed the fuel pump, I changed the fuel filter and evap purge valve. Since then, I have been driving it with no major issues. 

About a week ago, I stopped at a store on the way home from work. When I started my truck to leave, it immediately started shaking badly and shut off. It half-started a couple times and shut back off. I ended up having to call a tow truck.

I thought maybe I got a faulty fuel pump since the symptoms were similar. I pulled out the fuel pump and put in a new one and replaced the strainer. 

After that, it still wouldn’t start. I tried a few minutes later and it suddenly started. I let it idle for a few minutes and I turned it off and back on a few times. 

Thinking it was fixed, I went for a test drive. I got about a mile from my house and it just suddenly shut off while I was driving. No shaking, no warning, just instantly off with no power steering. It stopped so quickly I couldn’t get off the road. I was able to put it in neutral and roll backwards and work it onto the side of the road. After a while of not being able to start it, I walked home.

After some research, I thought the next likely problem was the crankshaft position sensor. I got a ride to the auto store, bought a new one, and got dropped off back at my truck.

I changed my crankshaft position sensor on the side of the road, and it did nothing. It will crank but not start, and all the electronics work. I don’t know what else it could be, and I don’t have money to keep wasting on parts that don’t need to be replaced. I also can’t afford another tow.

1omsvtf,Remote starter install gone wrong — car starts then shuts off after a few seconds (Ontario),"Hello, I could use some advice before I decide what to do next.

I brought my car to a small local mechanic to install an automatic remote car starter. They gave me  a Code Alarm Elite CA6555E remote starter (I’m not sure orbits good or not, it’s just what they gave me and I wasn’t given an option). With tax it came to $650. It was supposed to take 2–4 hours but turned into 11 hours. 

When I finally got the car back, the remote starter starts the engine, runs for a few seconds, then shuts off every time, when I start it with the key, there’s a clicking sound like my turn signal is on but it’s not. Now today, it will lock and unlock and now turn on at all. 

There’s wiring hanging near my windshield, and I later found leftover parts from the box that make me think the install wasn’t done properly. The shop was super unprofessional about the whole thing and they refused to refund or discount me because they “had to work harder” on it.

I’m worried that if I bring it back, they’ll mess it up worse or blame me. The car starts fine with the key, just not the remote.

I’m a nursing student and can’t afford to pay another $650 or to pay and have it removed. 

From a mechanic’s perspective — what could cause a Code Alarm system to start the engine and then shut it off immediately? Could this be a bad wire job or bypass module issue?

1omri48,2018 Jeep Compass PCR Issue (Code P2AF5),"2018 Compass Latitude with ESS (main/auxiliary battery):

About a month ago, I started noticing ESS/Auto Start-Stop was deactivated on my dashboard. I didn't think too much of it considering I hate that feature like everyone else. I did begin to notice a sluggish start-up and began assuming the battery(s) were going. Vehicle's at 85k miles, purchased at 50k from a rental car dealership. I assumed that was the issue and that the batteries likely hadn't been replaced yet. Went to go start it one day and it was dead. I put jumper cables on the auxiliary battery and it started right up. I ended up replacing BOTH batteries at the same time.

Upon hooking up both new batteries, I got numerous check engine codes:

-U113E (Lost Communication with IBS sensor)
-P2AF5 (Power Control Relay for Aux Battery Issues)
-Vehicle will shut down for safety soon

Tried clearing the codes and starting the vehicle back up. Codes showed again.

I disconnected both batteries and let the car sit for about a day before trying again. Tried again; issue still persists. I ensured all connections to terminals were solid and to torque spec. No loose connections noted.

I hooked up a volt meter and noted the following info:

VEHICLE OFF
Main Battery: 12.54 volts
Aux Battery: 11.52 volts

VEHICLE ON
Main Battery: 14.4 volts
Aux Battery: 10.5 volts

I conducted a test on both batteries; they passed and showed good charge and holding ability. Aux battery is clearly pulling when the vehicle is running and is not getting any juice.

This led me to believe it isn't an alternator or battery issue, as the main battery is getting a charge. I BELIEVE it's an issue with the pulled codes, either being the IBS sensor or PCR for the auxiliary battery. From what I've read from others, this can quickly put the car into limp mode and auto-shut off. 

I thoroughly cleaned ALL battery posts for both batteries, including the PCR posts. I also replaced the IBS sensor on the negative main battery post. Made sure batteries were charged up. 

Both batteries showing above 12.6 volts with vehicle off. Fired the jeep up, main battery was showing at 14.9 volts, auxiliary showing at 11.3 volts. 

So, is this a PCR Issue? From what I've read in other places, when the vehicle is on, the PCR should be closed and the battery should be at the same voltage. When it's off, the auxiliary battery will draw more. And this particular instance when the vehicle is on, the auxiliary battery is showing much lower than 12.6 and the main battery is showing normal/charging.",1,1762114289.0,13,MechanicAdvice,1762198474,2025-11-02 20:11:29,2025-11-03 19:34:34,"xMebesx (Score: 1): Your PCR should be feed from one of the large fuses at the main battery.

They should all read the same ~14.7VDC, if one of them is reading 12V that fuse is most likely blown.

1omr5sk,2010 Equinox Low Beam Mystery,"Hi. First I am not a mechanic. I am an above average skilled man who has learned to do stuff off YouTube and reading.  So far, I have been successful at the stuff I feel is within my skill set working on my vehicles and gladly take my car to the shop when words like manifold come into play.

Here’s the deal. My daughter’s passenger side headlight went out. No big deal, went to the store and got a set of H11’s. Did you know the Equinox’s access to headlight involves taking off a wheel? I did not but also no big deal. Installed the new lamp andddddd nothing. I could tell when I got into the wheel well that it had been messed with before (it was missing the round access panel cover). Sure enough, the plug looked brand new compared to the plug (female 2 pin adapter) on the drivers side. Ordered a replacement (2 actually) from amazon, a crimper and heat shrink connectors for my Sunday project. I threw a multimeter on the old plug before cutting the wires and it was showing 12-14v (depending if car running or not). Figured it might just be an internal connection thing and cut the wires and installed the new one. Tested it again showing the same voltage, put in a new lamp (and an old one to be sure) and still no lights.  I repeated that last step hoping (praying, begging) that it was just a bad one and installed and tested the second one I had purchased.

The brights work on that side. The turn signal works. Everything works except the low beam. I checked both the engine fuses (it was like 32,33,34) as well as the interior fuses. There is no specific fuse for the low beams that I could find but there are mentions of relays and control modules (57 or 59 being one in the engine fuse box). The drivers side low beam still works fine.

What am I missing? What don’t I know? With the correct voltage (I assume) running to the plug adapter I am having a tough time comprehending why I can’t make LIGHT GO SHINY.

Any suggestions would be welcome and if I’m missing something super obvious please hurt my feelings and remind me why there are professionals out there.

Edit. Someone suggested checking the ground wire. I am not sure how to do that honestly.

Looking for advice from automotive enthusiasts that have a good gauge of truck reliability throughout manufacture years, generations and models. I'm in the market for a half ton pickup which I will not be regularly towing with. Truck will be used for side jobs on weekends transporting lightweight material to and from jobs.

I don't care about bells and whistles, my main concern is reliability. I'm in the midwest so I do want something with 4x4.

Well, I assumed since my car is basically labeled to where I’m only to interact with the manager they’d make 100% my car is good to go. Also, last time that had happened they paid for my towing, gave me a car to drive, filled up my gas, and had the mechanic that messed up come out and apologize along with a new oil change.

Your symptoms line up with post-starvation damage:

• Clicking/ticking = lifter or rod bearing starting to fail  
• Idle surging on its own = ECU reacting to unstable oil pressure/timing  
• CEL flicking on/off = misfire or timing deviation being detected

That short drive home could have been enough to scuff bearings once pressure dropped.

Recommended move:

1. Do not drive it anymore until verified
2. Double-check oil level now that filter is tight
3. Scan for codes to see if you have misfires or timing errors
4. Get a mechanical oil pressure test  and don’t rely only on the dash
5. If pressure is low or noise stays, you’re looking at internal bearing wear and likely a rebuild/engine swap

  
it might still be okay, but continuing to run it without confirming pressure will make things much worse.

1omk0fn,Noob question: geometry of leak,"I have posted about this problem before but I have a different question now: I recently bought a 2013 Chevy Sonic lt with  a 1.6 l ecotec naturally aspirated in it. I have been chasing down an oil leak.  First thing I did was change the oil, flush the coolant, change the timing belt, cam/crank seals, valve cover gasket, which were leaking. There is still a very smal leak though. I took it to a real mechanic who initially thought the leak was coming from the oil cooler gaskets but on closer inspection, he said the leak was an external oil leak from the head, probbably due to a poorly resurfaced head. Advised me to live with it unless it gets noticably worse. He did not do a UV test.   
  
OK, so every week I check the oil and coolant (they are full and clean). I also drive for 45 minutes on the highway and then put a plastic plate under the car and check the leak.

Here is the question: I am attaching a pic of the drips I got today, if the lower left corner of the pan is (0,0) , the lower right is (10,0), the upper left is (0,20) and the upper right is (10,20) looking at the car straight on then the drips are at (3,7) and (3,10). So they are underneath the pan. How would a leak from head gasket drip down to underneath the pan?

1omi1xa,"Advisory ""bushes starting to separate"", is it a scam?","Last month bought a 2022 second hand car (MG5) with 15k miles on it from an online dealer. There was an issue with a tyre pressure sensor, so I took it to my local MG dealership to get fixed, and the online dealer refunded me for it. As part of the job, MG did a ""free health check"", which resulted in an advisory ""NSF and OSF bottom arm rear bushes starting to separate"", quoting £655 to fix this. See pictures I extracted from the inspection video, I'm not a car expert and I can't really interpret them. While they quoted for the job and tried to get me to book it there and then, the mechanic in the video said it is not immediately urgent, to keep an eye, and check in the next service.

Is this a genuine issue or are they trying to charge me for an unnecessary job? The car is a few months out of warranty for this. I tried asking the online dealer that sold me the car if they would cover the cost, but they refused, stating:

""This car passed our inspections and all relevant components, including the rear arm bushes, were checked. The vehicle would never have left us if it wasn’t in a safe and great condition. The video from MG do not show anything currently wrong with the bushes. At this stage, it’s purely an advisory, and the car is safe to drive. They recommend monitoring the condition during regular servicing just to ensure everything remains in order. It’s also worth noting that a lot of the time, main dealers may suggest additional work, particularly on items not covered under warranty. However, as the video states, there is no current issue and the car is fine.""

January-my heater suddenly stopped working. But I realized it would work if I was driving at highway speeds. It also started overheating. Took it in and had the thermostat replaced. That fixed the issue. 

May-my a/c started doing the same thing, it would only cool if I was driving at a faster speed. I took it in and I honestly can’t remember what part they said needed to be replaced but what I do remember is it was $1700 because they have to remove the dash inside to get to it. So, I just left it as is. 

September-went out to start it and it would only make a clicking noise. I had someone jump it for me. Took it to autozone, they checked everything and said the alternator failed. I went and had it replaced. It ran a lot better. It didn’t feel like it was trying so hard if that makes sense. Also, my a/c worked like normal again for a few weeks but then went back to only when driving faster 

Last week-I was pulling out of a parking spot and it hesitated to move forward. Then it made a super loud grinding noise jerked to a stop. I was able to get it into a parking spot just barely. It would go a couple of feet then wouldn’t go anymore and was still grinding.

1omhv64,High RPM low load vs Low RPM low load during warmup. Engine wear question.,"I have a 2024 Nissan Z MT stock powertrain.



Over the past 2 years of ownership, I have noticed ways I can decrease the time the engine takes to fully warm up (>= 160F engine oil, >= 160F Coolant temp). That is done by keeping the engine in the lowest gear possible for the current speed and letting it sit at 6k RPM half a minute after turning it on. The decrease in time is (no real empirical measurements were taking, just gut) somewhere between a 20%-40% reduction in time to warming up over Low RPM low load warm up (meaning using the highest gear possible for the speed). The time to warm up reduction range is *mostly* ambient temperature dependent. The colder it is outside, the longer it takes to warm up; therein the more difference high RPM makes warming up the engine. 

  
What I do not know is whether or not this reduces, has a negligible effect, or increases the overall wear during warmup, which is what we all know as the real killer of our engines. If you could keep the engine at temp all the time, then it wouldn't need to heat cycle at all and run forever like those diesel hauling trucks.

  
Maybe someone else has played around with this, and has more experience than me? Also this car does have a whole little module in the front of it diverting coolant to different parts of the engine to help facilitate a faster warmup. Warmup in this vehicle is only about 3/4-1 mile of driving (I've seen around 2 miles till fully warmed up in worst case scenario).

cheeseshcripes (Score: 12): So I work on spinning, high rpm stuff quite frequently for work, and have my own experience.


Firstly, why should you bring your engine up to operating temp? It's so all the spinning and sliding pieces of metal become the correct size so they lubricate and interact properly.


For the most part, the important bits are the pistons and bores, and the cam/crank bearings. So what happens if they are not the correct tolerance? For the pistons, fuel will get pushed past the rings and into the oil, diluting it and shortening its life, and the piston will rock/ shake in it's bore. For the cam and crank, they will move side to side with the loading and unloading.


Now, will these things become exasperated with higher RPMs? Yes, absolutely they will, higher RPMs, regardless of load, cause spinning things in bores to move more dramatically.


So what should you do? Drive the car in the rpm range an automatic would at light throttle."

1om7vif,AIO missing engine parts?,"Currently swapping a 6L V8 into my 68 chevelle and wanted to get the block hot tanked and while disassembling the engine i found 4 broken exhaust bolts. 

I called a local shop that quoted $80 for the cleaning and $100 for the bolts and that the process should be same day or next as it required little hands on labor so i wouldn't have to wait for already placed service request to be completed first. 

I kept tearing down the engine and found another bolt holding the camshaft plate in was stuck and starting to strip. 

I brought the engine with the heads off and torn down to just the cam, crank, pistons and retaining plates to the shop on 10/9  and asked for an adjusted quote to remove the new bolt and finish the tear down.

I was quote 1/2 hour of shop time. @$160/hr to finish the disassembly.

I verbally approved the quote and left the shop. 
Coming back the next day to collect my engine i was told it hadnt even been started and at best it would be middle of the next week.

I stop by that Wednesday the 15th and am told it still hasnt been started and would be the following monday and i should call next time.

I call that monday and told it should be ready by Wednesday but that they also need to machine the heads.

They give me an explanation that makes sense to me (this is my first engine build so i was happy to have someone giving guidance) that the heads need to be machined to ensure theyre flat for the head gasket.

I approve the additional service.

Notably i recieved 2 estimates to sign. The first was a couple days after i dropped off my block and was sent via tekmetric and i cannot view it anymore and the 2nd was the day my block was completed and i included screenshots

On Wednesday they reach out and tell me the block should be ready friday as their CNC machine is set up for a different size engine and cannot do mine today. They ask if im doing the camshaft bearing and if i have the tool for it. They offer to install my new bearings for $50

Friday comes and they call me around 5pm to inform me my total is now almost 1k and my engine is ready for pick up. 

I balk at the price and do quick math in my head coming far short of 1k. I try to view the estimate originally sent and see the website says the link doesnt work. I ask for an explanation and at this point i dont remember what they say. 

They end up knocking off about $100 and offer to drop the engine off at my house for me (i told them i wouldnt be able to get it that day due to short notice and i had to go to my 2nd job) 

I was pretty frustrated about the sudden $800 expense i was expecting to be closer to $500. 

I get to look at the engine the next day and see its not nearly as clean as i expected and see that i was charged more than i was quoted. I also looked at the invoice and saw an additional charge for cleaning the heads separately. 

As i wrote this i realized i had originally asked for just the block to be hot tanked. I also remembered that when i dropped off the heads with the block tli asked if they could clean those too since they alreadybhad then they said they would put then in a psionic cleaner. Thats all i remember about that

I decide to just take what i got and assumed i either didnt ask enough questions, pay enough attention to the first estimate or didnt have realistic expectations. I figured it was good enough and since i wouldn't be building another engine for awhile i would move on.

This week i tapped and painted my block and cleaned off the accessories, valve covers and valley cover and finally honed my cylinders tonight.

I went to open the box of returned parts to start cleaning my pistons and installing new rings only to find i have no pistons.

I didnt think to inspect the boxes of parts when i got home that night. All i have is a picture my BF sent me of the block and heads in bags and the 1 box of parts they left behind. 

At this point im baffled and livid. I feel pretty well taken advantage of and a bit like an idiot for not being more vigilant.  What im trying to figure out is if i should actually be more pissed off or not when i go to the shop on monday and ask what the hell happened? 

I hadnt planned to raise a fuss about the billing issues or the shape of the block when i got it back, however now that i need to go figure out where my postons are i kind of want an explanation for all this.

So far, I have been successful at the stuff I feel is within my skill set working on my vehicles and gladly take my car to the shop when words like manifold come into play.

Here’s the deal. My daughter’s passenger side headlight went out. No big deal, went to the store and got a set of H11’s. Did you know the Equinox’s access to headlight involves taking off a wheel? I did not but also no big deal. Installed the new lamp andddddd nothing. I could tell when I got into the wheel well that it had been messed with before (it was missing the round access panel cover). Sure enough, the plug looked brand new compared to the plug (female 2 pin adapter) on the drivers side. Ordered a replacement (2 actually) from amazon, a crimper and heat shrink connectors for my Sunday project. I threw a multimeter on the old plug before cutting the wires and it was showing 12-14v (depending if car running or not). Figured it might just be an internal connection thing and cut the wires and installed the new one. Tested it again showing the same voltage, put in a new lamp (and an old one to be sure) and still no lights.  I repeated that last step hoping (praying, begging) that it was just a bad one and installed and tested the second one I had purchased.

The brights work on that side. The turn signal works. Everything works except the low beam. I checked both the engine fuses (it was like 32,33,34) as well as the interior fuses. There is no specific fuse for the low beams that I could find but there are mentions of relays and control modules (57 or 59 being one in the engine fuse box). The drivers side low beam still works fine.

What am I missing? What don’t I know? With the correct voltage (I assume) running to the plug adapter I am having a tough time comprehending why I can’t make LIGHT GO SHINY.

Any suggestions would be welcome and if I’m missing something super obvious please hurt my feelings and remind me why there are professionals out there.

I took it to the Nissan dealership and they said the CVT transmission was fine. I hadn’t serviced the transmission for years, so I had them do it. It’s still making the same click and jerk as I come to a stop. There wasn’t any debris in the transmission fluid.

Gear shifts to D4, D3, N, R all fine. Once the car warms up to optimal temp it just goes downhill! Gears don't shift. Eventually reverse stops working (literally doesn't even click onto it) and only gear 2 works to drive (actually, 1 doesn't move, 2 moves, D3 and D4 don't click it just sits on gear 2). Here's what's interesting right... If I turn the car off. Wait 5 even 10 minutes. Start it up again and BAM! Gears working normal again (for about 2 minutes before it stuffs up again).

1omk3nu,Noob question: geometry of leak,"I have posted about this problem before but I have a different question now: I recently bought a 2013 Chevy Sonic lt with a 1.6 l ecotec naturally aspirated in it. I have been chasing down an oil leak. First thing I did was change the oil, flush the coolant, change the timing belt, cam/crank seals, valve cover gasket, which were leaking. There is still a very smal leak though. I took it to a real mechanic who initially thought the leak was coming from the oil cooler gaskets but on closer inspection, he said the leak was an external oil leak from the head, probbably due to a poorly resurfaced head. Advised me to live with it unless it gets noticably worse. He did not do a UV test.



OK, so every week I check the oil and coolant (they are full and clean). I also drive for 45 minutes on the highway and then put a plastic plate under the car and check the leak.



Here is the question: I am attaching a pic of the drips I got today, if the lower left corner of the pan is (0,0) , the lower right is (10,0), the upper left is (0,20) and the upper right is (10,20) looking at the car straight on then the drips are at (2.5,7) and (3,10). So they are underneath the pan. How would a leak from head gasket drip down to underneath the pan?

1om89a6,Repair Shop Replaced Front Two Brake Rotors & Pads; Two Months Later The Wheel Came Off While Customer Was Driving - Who’s At Fault?,"Fellow technicians,

Please tap in.

I am an Automotive Repair Shop owner that specializes in German vehicles; had a customer come in for Brake Rotors & Pads replacement on September 2nd, 2025.

As of today, November 1st, 2025, the same customer called me stating that his driver front wheel came off while taking an exit on a local highway.

Judging from the pictures, the driver-side fender & rocker panel moulding needs to be replaced, along with the outer tie-rod & possibly the brake rotor, and one of the lower control arms.

Regardless, the customer is going through insurance, but supposedly the insurance is only going to cover body panel damages (not the mechanical damages).

I’ve never personally heard of an insurance companies picking & choosing what they’ll cover, but that’s not the problem.

The problem is that the customer pretty much threatened to open a lawsuit against me if I do not cover the insurance deductible & whatever costs may be associated with the mechanical repairs.

I told him point blank that I would not be paying another repair shop for repairs that I’m able to do myself, to which he responded that he no longer would want me to work on his vehicle, but I did not admit fault over the phone whatsoever.

My problem is that I replaced his brake rotors & pads TWO months ago; had this happened the day of, or within a week, I’d definitely be liable, but he’s also claiming I was the last one to remove the wheels, which I will never be able to verify, it’s a he said, she said situation.

My question is - who is liable in this instance?

I use a torque wrench for this specific reason, and find it incredibly difficult to believe that the wheels weren’t tightened properly, otherwise, they’d have came off the day of if not the same week, not two months later & hundreds if not thousands of miles later.

You might be able to wing it. You might be able to pull over and turn the car off to let it cool every time the temp gets too high. You might be able to move quick enough to not need fans at all, or get up to like 60mph to cool it off quicker. But an overheated engine can quickly and easily total a car. Thats a big risk. 

Maybe you can fix it yourself to save money. Look for YouTube videos about it, especially by ChrisFix. There arent many reasons why one fan would quit but not the other, and as far as I know, thats a sign that its a relatively easy fix."

This week I hand-assembled the rest of the PCB and electronics. I added the buttons, a shift LED, and a light sensor. I tested the display and started coding.

For now I set fixed ratio limits for each gear by hand (no calibration yet). During shifts, when I press the clutch, the RPM/vehicle speed ratio changes a lot and drops outside those limits. The display then shows nothing or sometimes the wrong gear.

I’m thinking about filtering: the ratio should stay stable for a short time before I switch the shown gear. I could also watch if the car is accelerating or braking and use that to guess the next gear (likely upshift when accelerating, downshift when braking).

1omuyhm,Tips for getting non-trivial (but non-catastrophic) work done on a car in a timely manner?,"Hi! I’m not a mechanic myself but a driver, and I’ve been having a really tough time with my 2012 Civic with ~165k miles on it. Some of the electrical components are beginning to fail and need to be replaced. The extreme amount of time it would take me to be able to figure this out and try to fix it (and probably fail) as a layperson isn’t worth it to me. I’d really like to hire this work out. 

I understand I am not the expert and that mechanics have to balance many competing priorities as well as deal with unexpected setbacks. I also understand that my issues are not routine and will take longer than something routine like an oil change. 

I’ve explored several mechanics in my area. Since none of them offer loaners or any kind of transportation, I try to stick to the 2 or 3 that I’m very lucky to live within walking distance of. But I’ve also explored options farther away at a greater inconvenience to myself. I have explored local small businesses (down to a one-man operation) and larger chains. I have experimented with places that are considerably more expensive and others that are considerably less expensive. Regardless, the following ALWAYS and without fail happen:

**I call ahead, describe the issue, and ask if they have availability to work on my car.** I ask for a very rough cost ballpark, understanding they will send me an official estimate to sign off on later. They assure me they have plenty of availability and to bring the car in. 

**I drop the car off, explaining the issue and perhaps providing a video or photo of the problem if applicable.** This is usually in the morning, sometimes right when the shop opens as my car loves breaking down on weekends (especially long ones) or right before shops close. 

**I mention if I have a theory about the cause VERY briefly and usually they will volunteer their opinion (sometimes even if I don’t give my theory) but of course let me know that a diagnostic will be required (which is fine obviously).**

**I ask for a general ballpark timeline given the seeming nature of the issue, while communicating I know they can’t tell me exactly when the work will be done.** I live in the suburbs and while I’m lucky to be in (very inconvenient) walking distance of some things, being without my car for long periods of time  is really problematic. 

They give me a ballpark—I’ve never received a ballpark of more than “you can definitely pick it up tomorrow!” This is with me emphasizing that I am looking for a worst-case estimate for planning purposes and not trying to add pressure. Many times they assure me I will be able to pick it up, fixed, same day. 

**I ask if they will update me and if so how, and also what time they close.** Universally they promise to call in a couple hours once the car is diagnosed. 

**I leave the car there and hear nothing all day.** If I wait until they close, I will not hear anything at all. 

At this point I usually wait until 30 minutes–1 hour before they close and call. Sometimes they will not have any info because the diag hasn’t even been started. Sometimes they will have a ton of info and an estimate and be ready to proceed, as if they were waiting for me to call.

Occasionally they will be extremely confused and have to call me back because they have no idea who I am or what car I’m even talking about—last time a shop did this to me for a full day; every time I called they’d say they’d have to call back because they had no idea which car was mine and the guy working on it had called out and no one else knew anything. 

**At this point, although it has never been explicitly communicated, it is obvious that my car is spending the night at the shop and my plans for the next day will need to be adjusted.** This is to be expected. 

**I repeat this process the next several days.** Usually at this point there are all kinds of extenuating circumstances. Many times the shops are understaffed and packed with work and can’t get to my car (despite communicating otherwise when I asked them initially). That’s a common one, as well as the variation that someone had the audacity to call out sick and now they can’t work on my car. 

Another is that there’s a darn part that they’re waiting on. Once I actually got to work with the manager of a shop and he just told me the part and I got it myself and had my car back in the actual amount of time I’d been told; that has never happened again. I guess otherwise they order it via snail mail and wait 1–3 business days?

This one buys them a lot of time, especially if it can be stacked with other things. For example, one time my car was in the shop and it was raining a lot that week. This meant that all the walking I had to do to go places without my car was absolutely miserable, but it also meant that one one-man operation held onto my car for, I’m not kidding, 2 WEEKS without ever being forthcoming about this or updating me because he can’t work in the rain, and when I eventually took it to another shop, they couldn’t get the part for several days because of the rain. Note that the rain was not a severe flood that required evacuation or precautions; commuters are expected to show up to work but I guess parts can’t be delivered somehow?

**Eventually I am told that the process is complete—diagnosis, repair, etc.** I come to pick my car up. 

*(This next step doesn’t ALWAYS happen, but it’s been happening more frequently lately so I’m adding it as it’s a big part of why I’m posting.)* **The issue *persists* or is *worse* than before!**

The first time this happened with an AC repair, the shop tried to blow me off until I was able to concretely and firmly prove it wasn’t working, and they fixed it immediately and quickly at no charge.

The second time this happened was when my car had been failing to start and the issue was a bad connection to the negative battery terminal sensor that I guess sent the wrong info to the alternator (again, I’m not a mechanic). I finally got that part replaced and it helped…but then the issue began again, this time seeming to be the immobilizer although it wasn’t completely clear—I gave the shop that fixed the terminal sensor the benefit of the doubt that the immobilizer had not been an issue at that time so they shouldn’t have been expected to catch that as part of the (pricey and time-consuming) diagnosis.

The third time I went to get the ignition switch replaced and new keys, and it worked at first, but now the immobilizer is intermittently failing much more explicitly. 

TLDR
**I am mostly at this point trying to avoid being without my car for 3–5 days at a time and to have some kind of communication that doesn’t become a part-time job on my end for me to manage.** If that means I have to acquire the part myself because they will not do that in the most efficient way possible, fine. If that means the place gives me a free loaner, fine. I understand some major jobs will require several days’ worth of work, but when the car doesn’t even get looked at until after it’s been sitting at the shop overnight, that’s an issue for me. 

Should I just be taking my car to the dealer for everything? Is that the answer? Or is there some better way I can communicate? I always strive to be polite, clear, concise, helpful, humble, and respectful of everyone’s time. I don’t get that in return at all and even without going to the dealer, these are significant sums of money I am paying to basically have my car held hostage, have no way of planning ahead for time without the car, and now lately to have the car not be even fixed properly. And this is consistent with seriously 3 or 4 different mechanics I’ve been to in the past couple of years, at different sizes and price points.

sexandliquor (Score: 1): Basically, because you, like many customers, don’t understand the intricacies and how complicated car repair actually is. 
On top of that it sounds like from what you describe, most of your problems are more on the electrical side rather than mechanical. Which adds a whole other level of complexity to it. Mechanical issues on a car are a bit easier to diagnose and fix/replace. A physical part breaks and you replace it and the car gets back on the road again. Knowing how to diagnose and fix electrical issues on a car is like a multi discipline thing of being a mechanic, electrician, and computer/IT guy in one. So it’s more complicated, takes more time usually, and is usually doing a lot of bullshit to fix one nagging thing. 

You, like most customers, want some sort of firm timeline beforehand and as you can tell, nobody can really accurately give that to you and adhere to it 100% of the time. Shit happens. The repair becomes more complicated than foreseen to be on the outset (because most of the time we have no idea what we’re fighting until we start digging into it. So we can’t really tell you an accurate ETA on repairs before we even know the full scope of everything). 

Sone shops have service writers (the people at the desk that take your info and car keys). They’re the middle man between you and the mechanic. Things sometimes often get lost in translation or aren’t communicated from one end to the other. Which is why you sometimes have this disconnect. Sometimes the more you come in and tell the service writer, thinking you’re doing a good job thing by providing as much info as you can, the more you’re just kinda hosing them down with information that may not be needed or complicates how they’re breaking down the info to relay to the mechanic. 
Kinda like how this is a long ass post that didn’t really need to be this long with all the extra information about you walking and such. 

Sometimes a customer needs to be told what they want to hear to get the job in the door. If you want to hear that the job will be done in a day then oftentimes that’s what you’ll be told even if it isn’t necessarily true. Because it’s a business and if it’s not that shop then it will be another. This isn’t always the case but it happens. 

Nobody is holding your car hostage. Be serious. 

Long story short- always plan to have your car in the shop longer than you think it may take. Have contingency plans. We can’t predict the future or always tell you accurately what’s going to happen. It’s a very up and down chaotic business by its very nature. A shop can be really slow and then get slammed suddenly. And that’s just the way it is. We can’t plan for you because we can’t even plan what’s going to happen for ourselves. Just like you may feel like you’re beholden to the whims of the mechanic, we often feel like we’re beholden to the whims of all the shit we have to deal with too.

1omurge,"2008 Mazda 3 auto — lost 4th gear after fluid change, thinking valve body — need advice","Hey guys,
Looking for some second opinions before I replace the valve body on my 2008 Mazda 3 automatic (FN4A-EL / 4-speed).

Here’s the full story:
	•	97,000 miles, transmission had dark fluid, hard Reverse and a little bump 3→2 downshift.
	•	Did a drain & fill with fresh ATF (Valvoline MaxLife).
	•	Right after that it drove perfectly — all shifts smooth, 4th gear working great.
	•	After some driving, AT light came back, and it stopped going into 4th gear again.
	•	Now it shifts 1-2-3 fine but stays in 3rd; hard bang into Reverse sometimes.
	•	No slipping or whining, just no 4th gear.
	•	Mechanic scanned it — said “valve-body code.”
He thinks replacing valve body might not help and suggests full trans replacement.
	•	Fluid still looks good; I’ve already done a second drain & fill.

So now I’m debating:
	•	Replace valve body (I can DIY, ~$250-$400 for a rebuilt unit), or
	•	Bite the bullet and swap the transmission.

From what I’ve read, the 4-speed FN4A-EL loses 4th/reverse when Solenoid E or the valve body passages get clogged.
Seems more like a hydraulic control problem than a burned clutch, but I’d love to hear what you think.

Anyone here had the same symptoms?
Did a valve-body swap fix it for you, or did you end up needing a full transmission?

Thanks in advance!

Solenoids don’t typically fail or get clogged up for no reason. The valves in the valve body don’t typically get hung up for no reason. There’s material in the transmission coming from somewhere that caused that problem. So replacing the valve body doesn’t actually fix the real issue here, see? What you’re gonna end up doing is replacing the valve body, the transmission works again for a bit, then you have the same problem again with that new valve body because you didn’t actually fix the original issue. And now you’re gonna replace the transmission anyway, having spent more money than if you had just done so before."
1omujec,Flush steering rack by pumping fluid backwards?,"Hi all,

I just replaced all the lines and power steering pump on my 2007 sienna.  The old system was rough.  All the lines leaked like hell and the pump was... not good.  It was run dry or very low for weeks at a time.

After putting all the new gear in, filling and burping, everything seemed good.  Then I took it for a little drive and noticed the power steering going out intermittently, usually at low or idle rpm.

It seems like the most likely issue is crap in the rack from the old pump.  Since the rack is otherwise in good shape, I'd like to avoid replacing it. 

Here was my idea: disconnect the pressure line from the rack, pull the return line from the reservoir, fill return line with fluid, push it through with compressed air.  The hope being that I could dislodge whatever crud is impeding flow during normal operation.

What I'm wondering is: has anyone done this? Do steering racks have any one-way valves or other stuff that would make this impossible? Am I likely to blow out any seals?

More generally: how would someone who knows what they're doing try to clean out a likely contaminated steering rack?

If the fluid isn’t getting super dirty super fast, the rack is internally damaged. 

If there’s like heavy metallic gunk that just keeps coming out - further evidence of damage. 

Air would not help at all and would likely make it worse.

One of these tasks is to check how fast your engine (engine coolant) warms up. It uses your RPMs, coolant temp and ambient temp readings to estimate when your car is supposed to reach the normal operating temperature. When your car fails to reach the target fast enough, PCM throws a P0128 code and you are supposed to figure out why.

* Very often, your thermostat stuck open, partially open, or opens sooner than required.
* Not often, you are low on coolant and your coolant sensor measures the air gap temp.
* Less often, your water pump doesn't work for some reason, or there's a clogged coolant passage, and your coolant temp sensor measures the temperature of the liquid that doesn't flow through the engine.
* Less often, ambient temp sensors or coolant temp sensors report garbage readings, which alter PCM calculations.
* Less often, your coolant is contaminated.
* Rarely, your fans stuck on.
* Rarely, your thermostat temp rating is lower than your OE temp rating (wrong thermostat).

The only time I didn’t feel like changing my own oil I brought it to Valvoline before I had to go to work.

As soon as I left and got on the road I started seeing some smoke out of the back and pulled over to a Wendy’s down the street, I checked everything (but the oil negligently enough) and it all looked fine other than some oil around the blow off valve, figured they spilled some and the smoke I saw would burn off on the 4 mile drive to work.

After I left that parking lot heading to work my car started smoking out of the hood and then smoke screening out of the exhaust while puttering and missing with a check engine light flashing so I pulled over into another lot and called it there until I got off, when I got back I hooked up a code reader showing that cylinder one had a misfire so I pulled the coil pack and plug to see if they had oil or anything and they looked fine and that’s when I finally checked the oil and saw the picture above. I’ve been running 5.1 quarts instead of their 4.5 recommended since I got the car back in 2023

I filed a claim and they automatically accepted responsibility luckily since I used to work for them and know they like to dodge responsibility and gaslight into avoiding it so they must’ve royally screwed the pooch.

It's got 330000km but the turbo was replaced, it's always been serviced regularly and it always ran well. 
I had the DPF removed because the car would go into regen pretty often and smell like burnt soot. The mechanic took the exhaust out, emptied the filter, soldered it back and put the exhaust back. He also had the car remapped to skip the regen circles and left a few plugs under the hood unplugged to prevent the car from rebooting the regen thing.    
Since day one after the repair the car smelled like the exhaust was going straight to the cabin but he blamed it on the exhaust being rusted and probably having a hole in it. I had the car inspected from under without taking the exhaust out and there was no sign on rush from engine to the terminal part of the exhaust.   
I noticed a hiss coming from the front part of the car when accelerating and I attributed it to the exhaust gas pressure now running through the pipe at full pressure, but the hiss became a mild scream in a few days, but the mechanic told me he didn't have space to check it now, to come back on Monday.    
One of the last times I turned the car off before getting on the highway i heard a fan from under the car lightly grinding while slowing down, after the engine stopped. 
On Friday the car died on the highway, lost pressure and never started again. The engine rolls, but doesn't start. The mechanic that came on the spot tried starting it and pulled the oil stick out and smoke and oil came out of the hole.    
   
Now, with what level of certainty is the engine failing associated with the fap removal? I read that exhaust gas recoiling into the engine could have been the cause (maybe that's why the smell) or a bad remapping.

You can test it by back-probing the signal output wire with the ignition on, and slowly rotating the throttle plate while watching for a smooth ramp-up in voltage on the signal wire. If the voltage jumps or drops at any point, that's a bad spot on the potentiometer wiper, and your ECM doesn't know where the throttle is at that point, so it stutters with the fuel delivery.

Of course you can try just replacing it if you prefer not to go through the diag. 🤷‍♂️

Here’s the story. I bought a 2007 hhr lt 2.4l 140,000 miles, auto trans. When I bought it, the brakes went low but still engaged near the floor and the stopping power was alright (enough to get home, sketchy nonetheless). 

The front calipers were super rusted (I’m talking thick layers of rust) so I went ahead and swapped them out for new ones. Yes the bleeder valves are facing up. After the swap, the brakes no longer had any pressure. They go straight to the floor, car on or car off. I bled the brakes with the 1 man bottle method (RR, RL, FR, FL) probably 5 times. Fluid comes out as you would expect while pumping the brakes. Still no pressure. 

I used my topdon scan tool to do an abs bleed. I did that a few times as well. The abs motor makes sound, seems like it’s working fine. I cracked each of the lines leading off of the abs module one by one and each line has fluid coming out. 

I almost feel like topdon just does the wrong sequence. It has me crack the Front Left, and pump 5 times, then front right, back left, back right. But I don’t really know much about abs bleed. So I just follow what it tells me. Side note, the only time I have felt any pressure build is when I’m doing abs bleed on the front right wheel. After I move onto the next there’s no pressure. 

I don’t see any leaks on my driveway.

I checked the brake fluid through each process and it’s always been full.

The steering wheel felt slightly loose and there was a shake when coasting at moderate speeds(50-80km/hr). Didn't seem to shake at low speed or at higher ones once on the highway. The shake would go away on acceleration or while braking. The shake was also pretty minor, arguably unnoticeable and being a new vehicle to me I wondered if it was even something to worry about at all. Not being an overly mechanical guy I figured it was possibly an out of balance wheel. I was going to call the dealership more local to my home to check it out once I was back in town. Fast forward and the shake got worst and more consistent. Pulled over to find a broken stud on one of the wheels and all the other lugs about ready to fall off all together. 

My question to all of you is does the original shake seem like a loose wheel? I thought that it was odd that the shake went away when accelerating or braking, doesnt seem like a symptom of a lose wheel using my own logic. Is the loose wheel and broken stud just a coincidence while there was also something else wrong? Or does the loose wheel explain all of this? 

For the record the dealership will be looking at it monday, im just curious as to what people think, so I can explain to them better what it was doing.

Quick info: the Power Door is OFF.

I just bought this car in New Zealand to travel around the country, and yesterday while driving, the door suddenly opened even though it was fully closed. Since then, even when I close it manually and lock it, it reopens automatically.

When I close it, I hear a short “closed” beep, then a second later the door moves slightly, makes a long beep, and I can pull or push from inside to open it fully. The door won’t stay closed, even if I quickly lock it from inside — the lock doesn’t seem to hold.

When the Power Door is ON, the right door cannot be opened electrically, but the left door works perfectly, both electrically and manually.

I’ve lubricated with WD‑40 but it didn’t fix the problem. Nothing is blocking the rails. The handle feels loose compared to the other door.

With the engine off, it seems I can lock it with the key, and it doesn’t open.

A properly tuned internal combustion engine will produce little, if any carbon monoxide.  To compound this effect, any late model car with an emissions system that is functioning properly will reduce this negligible amount of carbon monoxide to an even smaller amount.  

Essentially, if your car is less than thirty years old and properly maintained, then there shouldn’t be much, if any carbon monoxide to leak.  

Punch a hole in the exhaust system before the catalytic converter and run the motor in an enclosed space and you can develop an accumulation of carbon monoxide.  Fail to maintain the engine and emissions systems and that accumulation could be significant."

My current car is a lovely 2004 Ford Fiesta, the most basic you can get, it’s great but I could do with something a bit better/newer/bigger for longer journeys away.

• Comfortable on long journeys 
• Probably something suitable for children/dog at some point as well.

Having no luck finding a cheap replacement that ticks all the boxes with my 3k budget 

My use of the car would be 1-2 days a week doing a 60 mile commute on the motorway mainly. With 5-10 miles every evening to go go the gym and occasional 30-60 miles on the weekend to drive somewhere nice to take the dog on a walk. Needs to be clean air zone compliant so most likely looking at petrol.

Some suggestions after browsing this subreddit would help 

-Honda civic ml8
-Skoda Octavia (not many petrol about)
-Toyota Auris mk1
-Toyota avensis (similar to the Octavia not many petrols about)
-everyone seems to love the Honda jazz and Toyota Yaris but I think they might be too small for me my misses and the dog and my 1-2 day office commute on the motorway?
- Ford focus mk2-3

Ideally it should have full service history right?

All the civics and auris I can find either don’t have full service history (because they’re 15-20 years old) or the ones that do have loads of advisorys for rust which I’ve been reading I should avoid? Been to view and test drive a couple but non were right.

Went to view two Ford focus mk3s which people say to stick with the NA petrol engines. The ones I went to view had a swimming pool in the boot near where the spare tire is and full of mould under the boot carpet where the waters been sitting and I worry about what that has done in terms of rust and corrosion and don’t want the hassle of fixing it.

Went to look at a mk2 focus again loads of rust advisorys and covered in rust underneath.

High mileage doesn’t really scare me aslong as the full service history is there. Most people selling on Facebook market place don’t have full service history so have been sticking to auto trader mainly.

Is my budget to low? A Japanese car with full service history and minimal rust which is bigger than the jazz or the Yaris?  Am I looking at cars too old and should increase my budget to the newer versions of the civic and Auris?

I’m based in de12 and willing to travel anywhere for the right car but within 40 miles would be ideal as relying on lifts from friends to go a view them as I’m now without a car and need one ASAP.

I will be gutted and ultimately I will be the one at loss as I will not be able to get nowhere near the real value since it’s been categorized. It’s a 2015 Audi A6 Black Edition. It can’t be a write-off for a bumper only, surely? Although I understand that there a lot more costs involved, including hire car, labor, etc. 

How does that work and what can I expect?

redandbluedragoneyes (Score: 3): your insurer will take the car and send it to one of their authorised repairer.

the repairer will do an assessment on how much it will cost to repair, this will be based of official parts from the manufacture and their labour cost.  
 so that bumper from Audi may cost 2k vs buying a 2nd hand one from a scrap yard for a few hundred pounds.  
the one that comes from Audi will be un painted, so then they will need to order paint from Audi and match the colour, plus you got primer, all the layers of paint and a clear coat.  
then you have any other repairs + labour cost.

your insure may loo at all the cost simply decide is easier and cheaper for them to write the car off rather then repair it.  
You can look to buy back off them, say the value the car at 10k but has a scrap value of 4k, it will be 10 - 4 =6k, so you can buy it of them for 6k and then do the repair yourself, go to a scrap yard, get the parts you need, take it to garage and to a paint shop, the paint shop will match the paint or may go to Audi to get the the paint or the formula. this will mean the car will now have a cat on it but you still keep the car.

Bosch are a respectable brand of OEM quality parts, including lamps. But the cost per lamp should be no more than about £15, plus fitting. 

They absolutely aren't Xenon, as a Xenon lamp would firstly not fit any halogen receptacle, and secondly, even if it were connected, the 14 or so volts from the alternator would not be enough to strike an arc across the xenon gas globe.   
Xenon lamps absolutely must have an in-car ballast to operate, which provides an initial high voltage kick to strike an arc, and then limit the current to mitigate the negative coefficient of resistance generally associated with gas discharge lamps. 

These halogen lamps aren't even Xenon fakes, with the blue coating. The lamp literally says Basic around the shroud. 

Even in the case you did have Xenon lamps, a basic OEM quality like Osram Original D4S (my car does take Xenon lamps) is about £40 tops. 

Why should you trust me? Because I am pretty sure I have aspergers and love anything that creates light.   
I could talk for an hour straight on how different types of electric lights work, and I know the electronic operations of each lamp too.  
No official qualifications though. But I can give you my personal guarantee that you have a good OEM quality, reputable brand of H4 *Halogen* fitted here, each of which should have costed an absolute maximum of £15.

Online search suggests changing sub frames could take a day or two, is that really the case?

Given it's only an advisory I probably wouldn't be terribly worried about that much. Subframe could become costly if it is getting bad and yes it can take a couple days to drop depending on the car and competency of the garage.

Main cost is always labour but if you can do it yourself then you're fine. Wouldn't be worried too much but definitely view the car to see the extent. 

I think budgeting 2k is going to cover you 2x what you would need personally given it's likely only surface rust"
1omdb3j,Should i buy this F31 320i ?,"Hi folks,

I’m not from the UK (France actually), but i feel this thread is pretty popular so maybe someone will be able to help

Friday i’ve been to see this F31 320i
https://www.leboncoin.fr/ad/voitures/3080205792

So to summarize:

2018 320i x drive with 60k miles, imported frown Sweden (found out myself, seller thought it was Germany) in very good condition.

Test drove it (it was flawless).
The seller offered to put in on a lift, and the underside of the car was in very good shape. He’s probably not trying to hide anything, judging by his attitude.

So what’s bothering me ? 

-There’s no records of service in Sweden outside of the I drive thing. Seller offered to call BMW tomorrow to see if they will give us detailed records, but he’s not optimistic because of privacy reasons of previous owners

-some of the dealer « identification numbers » located on the right side of each service indicated by the onboard computer, don’t match the ones i found by myself on a website’s report, is it that bad ?
 (Reports comes from Europavin, probably some dude who has access to BMW service history) 

Exemple: i drive shows a service on 12/23/21 made by dealer 35163, but the report i got says it was made by dealer 24823, mileage is exactly the same tho (pictures below) 

I want buy it, but should i ?

My mechanic told me that in the future I will need to do suspension and clutch as it is on it is way out and some rust proofing work down the line.

It is a reliable car, getting me around 40mpg. For the past year I have owned it, I have had minor issues and no engine issues whatsoever. The engine runs like a dream.

 However, I travel 30 miles to work every day except weekends so it averages out 150 miles a week. I also travel to my girlfriend on the weekends, she lives 20 miles away one way so it is more like 190 miles a week. A full tank only lasts me 330-360 miles.

1omd813,Brake judder at medium to high speeds,"Hi,

My Audi A6 C7 has started to develop fairly severe juddering under braking. It's most noticeable at speeds >50mph when braking lightly. I'm pretty sure it's related to the front brakes as I can feel some of the judder through the wheel.

All discs and pads have been changed in the last 12 months so there's probably <12,000 miles use on any of them. Fronts were changed by me (an amateur), so make of that what you will...

Any ideas what could be going on here? I'm pretty sure they're not worn because they're so new, and they look fine to my eyes (no lipping, pads still very thick, even wear pattern, no corrosion).

Is it worth me simply re-assembling the front brake assembly to make sure all fittings are tight etc. or is this a garage job? Car is on 155k miles for reference.

Did you thoroughly clean (wire wheel/brush) and degrease the hub faces & disc faces before fitting?

If all checks out with the suspension and the discs/hubs were prepped and fitted correctly, you want a DTI gauge on the discs to check for run-out. If run-out exists, remove the disc and place the DTI gauge on the hub - this will narrow down the source of run-out to either hub or disc."
