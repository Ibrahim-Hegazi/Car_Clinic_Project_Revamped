1nfivl8,2006 BMW 525i coolant hose,I was about a block away from my house when my car alerted me my coolant levels were low.

My car leaks oil, but to fix it I have to pull the engine. The leak isn't too bad (and hasn't got any worse in 2 years) so I said fuck it and I'm letting it leak until I have to pull the engine some day.

Common areas for a GM V8 to leak oil. Valve cover gaskets, front and rear main seals, oil pan. There are definitely more locations it can be coming from, but those are good places to start. Clean everything up and look for the leak source. No other way to find it. You might be able to add some UV dye to the oil to assist locating where it is leaking, but you need to clean everything up first."

If I'm guessing correct and it's one of your transmission cooler lines. What appears to be a cheap rubber hose clamped on with worm gear clamps in the background is what I would suspect. You need the correct hose (rated for the fluid type and temperatures and pressures) and use spring clamps, not worm gear clamps. Worm gear clamps cause leaks. They don't allow for expansion or contraction of the hose and eventually they cut through the hose too."

1nfduef,Parasitic draw seems to have kind of fixed itself once I started looking for it and I really don't like there wasn't an actual resolution to the problem.,"**The quick overview;** 2007 Scion tC started having sluggish starts and would need regular jump starts. I didn't want to deal with it so I spent a few months just making sure that it was running for at least 20-30 minutes every day wasting my gas. I had the battery tested and it showed as bad so I replaced it, but the problem persisted. I still didn't want to deal with it so I I just started disconnecting the battery every time it got parked and it hasn't needed a jump since. I managed to somehow deal with this for well over a year, which I don't regret at all now that I've put like 60 hours into looking for it. Anyway...

**What I've done so far;** I've had the new battery tested numerous times, and not just at auto parts stores but at Interstate Battery with their fancy testing equipment, and it has shown to not be the issue. Fine according to their load tester, fine according to their hydrometer tester, and confirmed to not lose voltage when charged with a trickle charger and left disconnected from the car.

Pulled the alternator for a bench test at a local place that specializes in rebuilding alternators, they said it was fine.

Checked for amp draw at the battery by disconnecting the negative terminal and bridging between the terminal post and the terminal connector. When the car goes to sleep it measures .028amps. I was told this is a normal reading indicating no draw.

I tested the voltage current draw across the top of every fuse in the car despite there being no indication with the amp draw test. I spent over an hour testing each fuse again and again. Every fuse showed no voltage with the exception of one, which when referenced to the amp draw chart would also not be enough of a draw to drain the battery.

I tested for voltage drop between both terminals of the battery and alternator despite the previous two tests indicating no excessive draw. With the car running and every component on, the positive side measured .18v, and the negative side measured .057v. I was told this is also a normal reading.

At this point I had a consultation with a local mechanic shop that specializes in electrical issues and ran them through the results of all the above tests. He said that if there is no indication of a draw, then there is no draw, and to hook the battery up and see if it still dies. So I kept the battery hooked up and started taking a dozen voltage measurements on the battery each day and kept at it for two full weeks.

Initially after being run the battery has a normal reading of 12.5-12.6 volts. Over the course of the next 12 hours or so the voltage drops to 12.23 volts but then stops dropping. I was able to leave the car untouched for over 4 days and it never dropped below that point. The car still starts normally at that voltage, but I absolutely hate that it's dropping at all.

And as mentioned above, at the end of these two weeks of watching the battery slowly partially drain, I disconnected and hooked a trickle charger to the battery overnight. In the morning it showed it as fully charged, and over the course of the next 24 hours the voltage only dropped .04 volts. Much much less than the .4 volts it drops when still attached.

So, since it's still managing to start just fine, should I just put it out of mind and call it good? I'm not particularly fond of the fact that it's still partially draining as it seems to indicate that the problem could very well resurface later.

I noticed a check engine light on my car a while back. I took it to a mechanic; they said it was a P0420 code for emissions and that I needed a new catalytic converter. I said I would save some money and bring it back for the repair when I was ready. I kept driving it for a bit, and the code went away. It popped up every once in a while. 

The most recent time it popped up, I took it into a different mechanic (my usual one), and they said that the turbo part is placed very close to the catalytic converter on my vehicle, and that it burns up relatively quickly. They got me a quote for a new catalytic converter and new O2 sensors, and I got the work done.  

I picked up the vehicle after the repair, and the next day, the check engine light came on again. I brought it back in; same code. They cleared it, I left, and it came back on again the same night.  

What are my options at this point? I live in a state that does inspections, and I don't know how having a check engine light on is going to affect that. It's also frustrating because I try to take good care of my car, got the work done that was needed, and it's still throwing the light.

Clearing the code is a temporary fix, as you've discovered - it's just clears the code until you drive a certain amount of miles and then it comes back on if the O2 reading indicates that the cat isn't working.

One trick is using a spark plug non-fouler that fits your O2 sensor which will move it away from the exhaust gases - it's a $10 solution that may work, but no guarantees.

1nfd18j,Intermittent shaking in my Subaru,"My car has an intermittent violent shake at highway speeds, and 2 mechanics have told me they couldn‚Äôt find what was wrong. 

I have a 2010 Subaru legacy 2.5L and it has ~140,000 miles on it, for reference. I spend a lot of time on the highway and have spent a lot of time on the highway for a long time. I‚Äôve only put 30,000 miles on the car myself. Timing belt, tlres (replaced, rotated and balanced), brakes, rotors, calipers and oil (recently changed) have all been replaced since I bought it. 

The problem is that when I reach 60-65mph SOMETIMES the car will semi-violently shake. Like the steering wheel rocks my hands and I have trouble holding the wheel straight kind of shaking. I feel a lot of it under the brake pad and from what I can tell it‚Äôs coming from the front of the car, possibly the passenger side but I‚Äôm not 100%. I‚Äôve held onto the shifter knob while it happens and I barely feel the shake there, if at all. Its mostly steering wheel.

Its worst around 65mph, but it doesn‚Äôt happen every single time I reach 60+mph. Sometimes it‚Äôs fine, drives very smooth. And Anything under 55mph, drives perfectly. 

It does not increase with acceleration but it does get worse when I brake (if it‚Äôs already happening, not every time I brake). 

So far, I‚Äôve taken it to a mechanic to specifically find what was causing it (friends with my dad so he most likely wouldn‚Äôt be lying) and he said there was nothing wrong, everything was tight and it should be good. My dad changed the brake pads, rotors and all but 1 caliper out around a year ago so he suggested the mechanic replace the last caliper. He did and the car seemed fine for a couple weeks, although I was not driving it incredibly often (1hr+ drives maybe 4x a week, every day short drives). 

The shake recently came back so I took it to a mavis and had them rotate and balance the tlres. Now it feels smoother but I can feel the wobble under my foot at highway speeds and am almost 100% certain the shake will be back within 3 days, honestly. 

Im not great with cars but I‚Äôm trying to learn bc of things like this. I read somewhere Subarus get dirt caked up on the inside rim and that could cause intermittent shaking at highway speed, so thats what I‚Äôm going to try next. 

But any advice would be sincerely appreciated! My dad can do basic stuff but he is stumped on this, basically said we had to wait until something got worse or something broke to be able to fix it. I‚Äôm a college student, I commute and spend about 12 hours every week just driving to school- I really, really would prefer not to have my car blow up on I-287 if I can.

I can get the mower started pretty easily now without starter fluid but am having issues with the mower dying on me after about 10-15 minutes of mowing. I start it up, and can move the throttle lever all the way from fully choked to slow without issue but when I start mowing after a few minutes the engine starts sputtering and dies unless I move the throttle lever back to choke and even then the engine seems to run smoother when I‚Äôm mowing at high speed. When I slow down it starts sputtering. If I‚Äôm driving slow for too long it does die sometimes but if I punch it and pick up speed the engine comes back to life.

Recently the battery light started to flicker on whilst driving and idling in my car.

I had the alternator, battery, battery terminals and battery negative cable replaced because the cable had a break in it and it would randomly cut the earth to the car. For 12 months it has been trouble free however till now. 

When the light is on the volts raise to 17-18v at the alternator, testing with a multimeter. The car runs rough ( I assume because the injectors are going hay with the extra juice) and things like the window wipers go faster.

 This last a few seconds or under a minute before returning to normal 14v. 

Do I need to replace the alternator ? Which is my next plan. Even tho it's not very old I know they can go at random times but I thought that the volts would drop not increase? What else could it be?

Update:: picked it up. It‚Äôs driving fine. Guy said it was likely caused by an arc to some wires near the filter.::

Early afternoon I got a coupon for a $40 full synth oil change at a chain I‚Äôve been going to for years. They offered an inspection I said no just the oil change. No inspection. (I could tell he doesn‚Äôt like I‚Äôm using the coupon but just jokes around about it with me.)

2 hours later he‚Äôs pulling me into the garage to show me what looks like a fuse that was forced out of its socket (the large lugs still in place) and my battery terminal disconnected.
(I thought that‚Äôs weird I just wanted an oil change.)
He says it‚Äôs for the battery, they‚Äôre getting the part ordered but the place closes at 5 so the car will have to stay overnight. Being reasonable I say ‚Äúhey it‚Äôs an old car, I‚Äôll pay for the fuse.‚Äù He said he‚Äôd take care of ‚Äúlabor‚Äù. I figured maybe just bad luck. Didn‚Äôt want to be all ‚Äúwhat did you do?!‚Äù like some people seeing he was nervous having to tell me the bad news. 

I thought it was weird a fuse would take more than an hour or two to get and replace when there are 5 auto parts stores within 2 miles so I find some info. I *think* based on size, location and he said it‚Äôs for the battery, it‚Äôs a fusible link. They‚Äôre like 80-100 Amp fuses for your battery in case something try‚Äôs to short your alternator or I assume a major electrical system. 
Nothing tangent to this has been an issue in my car in the 2-3 years of owning it.

My guess is they inspected my car anyway trying to find things to recommend (which is fine I get it.) But in the process of testing my battery or alt they must I‚Äôve shorted it right?
Tell me if I‚Äôm wrong but the lugs being stuck is consistent with someone not knowledgeable trying to force out the fuse. It looks like there are supposed to be two bolts that hold it in and you have to remove the whole fuse box to get to them. 

I‚Äôm not mad that a fuse popped. Even the OEM version of the part is $28 at the dealership.

WRONG.  

Engine codes point to a ***symptom*** and it's up to you to determine the ***underlying cause***. When I see people  just throwing parts at the car without troubleshooting.  Did you swap the known bad cylinder parts with known good ones  (IE swap 3,4 coils with cyl 1 and 2) before you just started purchasing? If the coils were bad, the codes would have moved (P0301, P0302). 

So many things could cause this..  Fuel Pressure, Injector health, vacuum leak, electrical, compression

First MAKE SURE THE PLUGS ARE FIRING.  Just because you replaced the pars, doesn't mean they are getting signal.  Then swap the injectors from cyl 3,4 to cyl 1,2 -- Does the code move, no?  Not injectors.  Then do a simple compression check, make sure you have compression in 3,4.  If that comes back make sure your injectors are getting signal (noid light). 

That's just to get started.  You have to have a FULL PICTURE of how the engine runs and how OBD works to properly appreciate the engineers behind it.  They made it to where with minimal dollars spent, we can 99% of the time drill a problem down to the source without having to replace parts to do so.

1nfes55,App for tracking car maintenance?,"I used to have a great little app on my iPhone where I'd put in oil changes, buying gas, et cetera, and it'd tell me when various maintenance tasks were due. But the developer quit updating it, and one day I installed a newer iOS and the app broke. So I've been trying to find a replacement. 

Now, for me, the #1 thing would be ""keep all my data on my own device."" There's absolutely no legitimate reason why I should need to have internet access to record a fuel fill-up or to have an alert go off when I enter a certain mileage. But as far as I can tell, no such app exists any more. 

Read a bunch of reviews, and tried ""MyCar."" Annoyingly complicated, telling me stuff I don't care about while not doing something as trivial as telling me my MPG. (""At least 3 full tank refuels needed."" No, two is all \*I\* need to run the math.)

Then I tried CARFAX Car Care. I went to add tire info for my box truck. ""How many tires did you buy last time you replaced them? 1, 2, 3, or 4?"" The answer is ""6,"" you stupid app. It's an F-350 dually, so there's two tires in front and four in back. The answer for both my recently totaled 2000 Wrangler and my 1957 Packard would be ""5"", since they both carry full-size ""real"" tire spares that should be included during tire rotation. And I can't even load the Packard into the app at all, since it only allows adding a car by VIN or license plate, and it thinks VINs must always be 17 characters long. Wrong again, the VIN for the Packard is 8 characters. And their database apparently doesn't know how to look up collector car plates. I don't think I'll even try to add my Yamaha Riva scooter. 

I just want to be able to log gas tank fills and routine maintenance (tire rotation, oil change, wiper blade replacement, air filter, et cetera) and have it let me know when it's time to change/inspect/replace something. I don't need to know the car's current market value, how much I spent on repairs last year, or to automatically schedule repairs with my favorite shop.

Recently the check engine light has been randomly giving me the code for bank 2 running lean.   After checking for vacuum leaks, replacing the air filter, and cleaning the MAF sensor I decided that cleaning the fuel injectors might be helpful.  Went to pull the fuel pump fuse for the cleaning procedure and discovered someone had installed an aftermarket fuel pump relay, which is common on this model.  However, instead of wiring it correctly, they just jammed the trigger wire into the fuse socket (see picture).  When I pulled the fuse out I think the wiring in the back of the fuse block broke off because now I‚Äôve got no power for that fuse slot.  My guess is the wire jammed into the fuse slot caused the wire to burn up so when I pulled the fuse it broke the wire.
Anyway, now I have to pull the fuse block out and find the wire so I can splice an inline fuse holder between that wire and the relay and bypass the fuse block all together.  

The good news is that when I use a jumper wire and connect the relay to the battery, the car starts right up and I get no check engine light.

Start at the problem, not the solution. Find the solution through your engineering, don't just make stuff."

1nezpn4,350z or turbocharged brz,"Hi everyone , I‚Äôm after some tips, advice and personal experiences.

For a little context, I currently drive a 2008 250GT. It was a great car and I had alot of fun in it. However , I‚Äôve come to get bored of it and am passing it to my partner.

I am looking at two vehicles at the moment and am quite torn in what to choose.

1) 2005 350z
2) 2014 turbocharged brz (rocket bunny v2 kit)

My thoughts on the 350z (after driving one and doing abit of research) 
- it has a decent amount of power, especially compared to my current car. 
-has greater tuning potential 
- great look to it
-a lot of parts 

cons
-older car with less features 
- hard to find a low kms
- heavy 
-hard to find a nice condition one 

My thoughts on the BRZ
-has a turbo (wanted to hear that bov for awhile now haha) 
-immaculate condition 
-awesome looking body kit on 
-light weight 
- great steering 
-sporty looking 

Cons
-unfortunately I think it will still be quite slow, similar to my current vehicle?  Which I think I may find underwhelming and a waste of $$ on.

I work a full time job supplying major established mechanics in the area with parts, so we get to see how they operate open to close.

I rarely see any vehicle at any given shop for more than a day or two, and the ones longer are usually there for engine replacements or transmission work/replacement. And even then that's usually because they're waiting on the unit to be shipped in, once it's delivered to them within a day or two they're gone.

Then, when it's closing, every shop will pull all vehicles into their bays. When they have a full lot, they'll put vehicles on lifts, then park another under it. (Never seen any issues with them falling on the car below at any shop!) The shop that doesn't do this has a massive lot, and they have a pretty heavy duty chain link fence around the whole property with electrified wire and razor wire around the top of that. (While not a terrible side of town, isn't the best). And even then, they specialize in older vehicles, which can take time to work on by way of rust and seized parts, or difficulty locating discontinued parts.

So atleast for my area based on ~15 shops we service, no. Not standard practice.

I am guessing they are either taking in too many at a time, they are having trouble keeping techs, and/or the techs they have are not experienced enough to do things in a nominal amount of time.

Aggressive clicking noises and a Google search lead me to the battery, and I found this. I wedged it onto the nut (which, the hole is smaller than the nut so obviously not meant to be done) and it started, so I drove the 1 extra minute to work and had my boss look at it. He attached it as you can see, and it started again but much rougher/needing a pump of gas which I've never needed after a dead/disconnected battery before.

i've gone through several phases of testing power at multiple places along the entire fuel system and ultimately got power to all fuel pumps. in fixing the wiring i decided to bypass the inertia switch which, through testing continuity we discovered that, shouldn‚Äôt affect the delivery if fuel or function of the fuel system 


observed the plugs during turnover and we're getting good spark and it is in fact turning over. we checked to see if the filter was plugged but we observed that fuel is in fact coming out at the fuel filter. the only other thing we can think to do is use a fuel pressure gauge to test how much pressure we're getting to the block.

also to note: the high pressure pump randomly quit working. it locked up from inactivity i'm guessing but we took it off gave it power and it runs again. we slapped it back on and it runs with the key turn but still no fuel to the block. is it possible that the high pressure pump is shot now, despite being able to run?

we're at our wits end here. what started off as not getting power to the rear low pressure pump turned into a half a year project. any and all advice is greatly appreciated !

1nfdkyf,Part two of am I overreacting,"Turns out, no‚Äîbut I need help so I don‚Äôt back down to my mechanic‚Äôs excuses.

In a previous post, I wrote about my mechanic telling me my car was ready after my window had dropped into the door. I suggested it was the window regulator (the same thing happened on my passenger side, and that was the solution). He did replace the regulator, but also mentioned that my car had additional damage from an attempted break-in. He said he could get another company to fix that part.

He replaced the window regulator and fixed the door so it wouldn‚Äôt drop down again. But after driving for a day, I noticed several issues: the screw caps for the door were missing, the rubber seal that keeps dirt and rain out of the window was gone, the door handle was scratched, and my side mirror adjustment button no longer worked. On top of that, he did a tire rotation that left something hanging from the undercarriage (though I can‚Äôt say for sure if that‚Äôs related since I don‚Äôt know exactly how rotations work).

When I listed all of this in a text, he called me and said he‚Äôd come by my house to check everything‚Äîsince I‚Äôd already been running back and forth to his shop. He asked when I‚Äôd be home from work, and I told him. By 7:30, I was waiting, but then I thought: it‚Äôs dark, I‚Äôm a woman alone, and that just doesn‚Äôt feel safe. So I texted him to let him know not to come. No reply. I texted again the next day, and then he finally called.

On the call, he told me he was ‚Äúworking on it‚Äù and checking the cameras to see if the body shop person caused the damage I was pointing out. But then he added that he couldn‚Äôt give me any answers since he didn‚Äôt have proof of anything happening in the shop.

He also explained why he hadn‚Äôt shown up after work the night before. While it had been implied he would come within a couple of hours‚Äîor at least before dark‚Äîhe said his work schedule is unpredictable, and that sometimes he doesn‚Äôt finish until very late. He even mentioned that he occasionally visits customers as late as 11 PM. Like‚Ä¶ WHAT?

We eventually settled on me taking my car back to the shop, where I‚Äôll take pictures of the damage and explain everything again.

Reddit people help me to know if I'm wrong in anyway and to enforce my argument and give me a boost of confidence. Thanks in advance!

I am really just concerned about which type of coolant I should be using to refill after replacing the thermostat. I purchased the Dodge used from a Toyota dealership and often bring it there for oil changes since I purchased a plan from them and it include oil changes. They also check and refill other fluids as needed. I checked the color of the coolant in the radiator and it appears pink in color. I called them to ask what they use and they advised they use the same coolant on all their vehicle new and used and all makes and models. So I‚Äôm thinking they put in a coolant better suited for a Toyota into the Dodge.

The mechanic told us it doesn‚Äôt have much life left, it is burning oil pretty fast and all. He also suggested that there is no point trying to do an engine replacement because it would likely cost more than the car is worth.

I have heard from people that a used engine replacement in Vancouver for a beetle could be under $6k (1.8L). This doesn‚Äôt sound too horrible to me (feel free to let me know if I have the price wrong). Especially when considering the fact that a newer, 120k~ engine could likely add at-least 3-5 years to the car‚Äôs life span.

1nf9a5y,2013 Dodge Grand Caravan problems..mechanic is clueless.,"This is starting to get real weird to me and I‚Äôm sorry for how long this is gonna be. I need advice. I have friends at work that work exclusively with Dodge vehicles but I can‚Äôt always contact them right away and would like some more honest opinions (I definitely trust my friends, but this mechanic? Something ain‚Äôt right). 

So a month ago, I brought my vehicle in. It was struggling to start. It would sometimes turn over, then sometimes it would start and flat out turn off. I had to prime it before it would actually start. 

So. First round at the mechanic, misdiagnosed and claimed they almost wanted to replace my throttle body, yes REPLACE. I‚Äôm a dumb woman here that doesn‚Äôt know shit about cars, but it took a simple YouTube search to learn that these things (unless cracked) just need to be washed. My friends at work confirmed the very same. 

They claimed it was the fuel pump. 

Next day, after getting the car back, still rough start. I spent $750 on that fuel pump and I actually had ZERO money from savings, my financial cushion and struggled two weeks straight before I could afford an uber to get it back to the repair shop. All frustrating considering my friends at work knew goddamn well it wasn‚Äôt the fuel pump. 

So I bring it in three days ago now. They claimed it was the fuel pump regulator. It was losing fuel pressure whenever it started. 

They aren‚Äôt charging me for that. 

But today they started it? Same problem. 

Now, I‚Äôve been researching around. And yes, I‚Äôve googled, talked through the issues with AI, and *everywhere* I see is saying it‚Äôs the TIPM that‚Äôs most likely the problem, especially with this specific model of dodge. I called the mechanic and they said it wasn‚Äôt. 

What else could it be? Do you think they‚Äôre lying? Did they miss a step? 

Guys, they told me *to continue looking around for suggestions because they‚Äôre truly stumped.* 

I‚Äôm baffled right now. I don‚Äôt want to be one of those people that google a goddamn symptom, but I am hoping for some honest guidance here. From what I‚Äôm reading, if it was the TIPM the entire time, they very well wouldn‚Äôt have needed to replace those two parts. 

Like I said, any guidance or opinions would help. I‚Äôm sure I might have used the wrong term at some point. The only saving grace this place has (not a chain by the way), is the fact they‚Äôll let me borrow one of their cars tomorrow over the weekend and pay for my uber.

It was replaced several times and ultimately settled with a sensor ordered from Nissan BUT here's the thing: This car is running incredibly rich.

That brings me to the mass air sensor.

Just wondering about the following. I'm no mechanic so I'll simplify, sorry for that. 

1. Go-Karts use a **pitman arm** in order to steer, **without any gearbox involved**, like [in this 3D video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MopyFDa3vU)
2. Same goes for some ATVs, like [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHk14kfzNb0&t=30s), from 0:30 to 1:52 : **Pitman, no gearbox**
3. Some trucks use a **pitman arm**, but they are obviously **powered** (via gearbox or other) because of the weight of the truck.

My question is : For a light microcar project, designed mostly for urban areas (no off-road), no weighing more than 1000lb/450kg. Would it be possible to have a steering system similar to 1. and 2. ? Meaning a pitman without any gearbox or power assistance ?

This is not actually the starter motor, but the Bendix that extends and retracts the starter gear. There is a solenoid with the starter gear on the end that simultaneously pushes the gear into the flywheel while starting the starter motor. This is what they sound like when the Bendix fails.

The grind at the start is from poor engagement. The gears aren't stripped, but they will be soon. The grind after you let off the keyswitch is because the Bendix solenoid is sticky, probably from gear tooth material and other garbage that collects over time. The spring doesn't have enough pressure to pull the solenoid back before the flywheel starts trying to drive the starting motor.

1newqfi,Volkswagen mechanic messed up my 2013 Beetle - Are they liable?,"This will be a long back story so I appreciate you reading! 

I bought a second hand 2013 VW Beetle a few months ago, it had some known issues but the price reflected that. The previous owner had gotten the engine ‚Äúrebuilt‚Äù by our local Volkswagen dealership in 2022, so I took the leap thinking it couldn‚Äôt be anything too bad if the engine was only a few years old. Naive I know, but it test drove fine and I was super excited to get my dream car. Well as it turned it needed a timing chain replacement which cost me $4.5k AUD total üòÖ. When my mechanic was working on the timing chain they noticed there was some ‚Äúplay‚Äù in the crankshaft timing sprocket, like it‚Äôd been forcefully shoved back in resulting in a couple millimetres of extra room. It would‚Äôve ended up costing thousands more to get that fixed so my mechanic suggested a cheap fix of liquid metal to fill in the extra room. We gave it a shot but it ended up failing within a couple weeks. 

Essentially back in 2022 the car had cylinder 1 & 3 misfire that resulted in a partial engine rebuild which Volkswagen had to pay 60% under warranty. But looking through the records my mechanic was not impressed, and said the car shouldn‚Äôt have even been released back to the owner in the state it was after the ‚Äúrebuild.‚ÄùVolkswagen had the car in the shop for 3 months and replaced the following parts: head gasket, timing cover, water pump, pistons and rings, thermostat and injector seals. Essentially this rebuild would‚Äôve been the only time anyone had access to that part of the engine so they would‚Äôve caused that damage and hoped it wouldn‚Äôt be noticed. 

Because of this ‚Äúplay‚Äù in the crankshaft timing sprocket my timing chain is likely to fail prematurely again. I‚Äôm so frustrated. I love my car but it‚Äôs already cost me thousands. I know it‚Äôs been a few years since the rebuild, but are they liable for this damage? Like I said previously, this part of the engine is only available and visible once you start pulling it apart. They are the only and last ones (since my mechanic) who worked on that part of the engine. Their ‚Äúrebuild‚Äù itself was dodgy so I‚Äôm not surprised they hid extra damage. 

I‚Äôm really just looking for advice in this situation because the more I think about it, the more angry at Volkswagen I get. I can‚Äôt afford to spend thousands more on my car at the moment. Can I prove they caused this damage & are liable? 

Thanks for reading and any advice you can give is greatly appreciated!

EDIT: 
Quote directly from my invoice of the timing chain replacement. ‚ÄúUpon removal found the crankshaft timing sprocket was previously damaged/incorrectly fitted.‚Äù He also stated it was likely shoved into place with too much force resulting in the extra ‚Äúplay.‚Äù

The torque converter needs to be properly indexed to the transmission oil pump drive. If at any stage the converter popped out and you have not properly re-seated it, tighteneing the bellhosing bolts can destroy the transmission oil pump. 

You'll likely need to remove the engine again. Remove the torque converter (beware oil will run out) Inspect for damage, including the front trans seal. Reassemble taking care to properly seat the converter. Measure the depth of the converter within the bell housing and make sure that depth is no less than the distance from torque converter to engine block (where bell housing mounts).

Torque converters usually have 2 flats that line up with flat sections within the oil pump. You can feel the converter pop into place if you slowly rotate it while putting light pressure inward.

Good luck."

All equals the flywheel is on it's way out, though there is zero clutch slip.

The question is there if you were in my shoes, would you look at getting it done? Realistically it's going to cost more to fix than the car is worth; but I've owned it for nearly 7 years and I have a weird attachment to it. (I've owned a 640d and Landcruiser during those 7 years, but they've both been sold and I always just kept the A3 as it was never worth selling it due to the low value)

There isn't anything else wrong with it, but it is at an age and mileage where even though I love the car, what else could be round the corner cost wise to keep it on the road?

What would you do?

Looking at a 2023 Tesla Model Y Long Range from Tesla CPO program. Haven't bought a car in 20 years and this is my first used vehicle purchase, so really need some experienced perspectives.

**Context:** First Tesla, first used car in decades, traveling from London with family to view Saturday. Feeling out of my depth with modern car buying, especially used EVs.

Any advice from people who've navigated Tesla's CPO process or spotted issues others missed would be massively appreciated.

**The details:**

* 40,474 miles, ¬£27,400 (highest price I've found for this has been \~31.2K)
* 21 months left on basic warranty + 1 year CPO extension
* Clean VCheck (no accidents, finance, etc.)
* Priced ¬£1,000+ lower than similar CPO Model Ys on Tesla's site

**The mystery:** I've been tracking Tesla's used inventory for weeks and noticed this car has been available since the previous owner returned it in February 2025 (7+ months). Most other CPO stock turns over much quicker on their website. Tesla won't explain why this one has sat so long - just says ""we cannot share vehicle history.""

**Questions for experienced buyers:**

1. **Is 40k+ miles in under 2 years excessive for a Model Y?** What should I expect for battery degradation?
2. **Why might a fairly-priced CPO Tesla sit unsold for 7+ months?** What red flags should I look for?
3. **What should I specifically inspect** that might explain why other buyers passed?
4. **Is the warranty situation adequate** to offset potential high-mileage issues?
5. **How long do CPO deliveries typically take** once you commit? Their contract has harsh delivery deadlines and very little control on the side of the buyer.

If Something Goes Wrong (Remedies)

Within 30 Days: You are entitled to reject the vehicle and receive a full refund if a fault becomes apparent. 

Within Six Months: You have the right to a repair, a replacement vehicle, or a refund. The dealer typically has one opportunity to repair it for you first. 

After Six Months: You are responsible for proving the fault was present at the time of purchase. 

Since you fall within the 6 month period, you cannot reject the car, the onus is on the dealer to prove the fault wasn't there at point of sale. 

However, it's likely it was there. My advice would be to contact the dealer regarding this and give them the opportunity to repair it, make sure you follow up with writing in email stating the issue, and if possible include the quotation/report from the garage you've gone to begin a paper trail if they do give you a hard time. 

If you paid ¬£100 or more of the cars value on a credit card, you should be protected for the full value of the purchase too. Look up section 75. This makes the credit card company and retailer equally responsible in getting you a refund, or a repair.

Only weaknesses I'm aware of are the wheel bearings (listen for any kind of rumble on a test drive), and the ABS sensor, which from the MOT history looks like it's recently failed and been fixed. So that's actually one less thing to worry about.

1nfbjsk,Car Valuation?,"Hi! I‚Äôm wondering how much my car would be worth and the online estimates seem to be very low. It is a 2011 318i Sport Plus edition, it has 53k miles and has a very clean MOT history, it does have an advisory currently for two rear brake pads.

It has new front callipers, discs and pads. It‚Äôs also had the fuel injectors replaced very recently. Air con has just been regassed and had two new front tyres recently. 

Its MOT was done in February as well as a full service. It has full service history and invoices for various bits of work. 

The car is very clean, a few very minor marks, but for the age it is in very good condition. The wheels could do with a paint job but can be done. I believe the car has only had 3 owners and has a fairly high spec (heated seats, Bluetooth handsfree etc‚Ä¶)

How much realistically would this go for?

They ended up In a really bad spot on the hard shoulder just as it ended for a slipway to join the motorway from their left.

He's an AA triple-platinum-with-honours member of about 35 years so they got to play the usual game of ""Yes I really need a flatbed for this"" and ""the driver is 20 minutes away"" for about 5 hours. 

A recovery wagon eventually shows up, dumps them at the nearest services and buggers off, an actual mechanic will be with you shortly, sorry, bye.

I advised him to ask the mechanic to take the front propshaft completely off, lock the centre differential/transfer case and drive home with rear wheel drive only.

After several more hours of waiting, this time mercifully with access to toilets, an independent garage mechanic rocks up and, having had it explained to him what an 9/16 spanner was and where he might find two of them, is persuaded to undo the 8 bolts, take the bits of propshaft off, and eventually off they trundle to get home at midnight or so.

I went round to fit a replacement propshaft this afternoon, and I was pretty surprised to be presented with the universal joint and flange that bolt to the diff, four bolts and three nuts... Went under the car to find that the mechanic had only removed the front half, and left the remains of the double-cardan joint bolted to the transfer case, flopping around and spinning with the output shaft as the differential was locked.

1neza3z,Advice needed please!,"Hi everyone, 

So I bought a 2019 Vauxhall Grandland X 1.2 petrol last month. When I picked it up, the garage told me they‚Äôd replaced the timing belt (the dreaded wet belt that these engines are known for). Problem is, I‚Äôm not convinced.

The paperwork from before I owned it in July says the cambelt was showing signs of ageing and cracking, and that it needed replacing.

The selling garage said they did it, but I had to call the RAC out for an issue which caused my car to go into limp mode. When they had a look, they said the auxiliary belt looked new but wasn't so sure about the timing belt.

They sent me an invoice when I asked for proof, but it looks sketchy:

It lists ‚Äútiming belt‚Äù as a single part, ¬£66 which I think is way too cheap for a wet belt kit.

No mention of a timing belt kit, tensioners, oil change, or filter.

Labour is shown as 7 hours but discounted to ¬£0.00.

Total invoice = ¬£0.00. (However, I think the garage where work was done is on the same site as the sales garage).

The selling garage says the car isn‚Äôt faulty, so I can‚Äôt return it. But I‚Äôm left with this weird 
Invoice that doesn‚Äôt prove anything, and I don‚Äôt know if the belt was actually changed or not.

I've got it booked in at the Vauxhall garage soon for an inspection, so hopefully I'll learn more then.

For a petrol getting an average of 40mpg or a diesel getting 43mpg it is 15p per mile for fuel (or was last time I checked prices, might be a fraction cheaper now). Diesel is better economy cruising but worse in traffic (I learned the hard way when I did a long commute where 1/2 the time was the last 1/4 of the distance in traffic), but lets use the 15p as the M25 is often start stop in rush hour. 88 miles a day is ¬£13.20, ¬£66 a week or ¬£286 a calendar month, just for fuel. If you drive for economy and dont have much traffic you might get it down to ¬£200 but Id be surprised if you did.

Now take an EV. If you drive it like you stole it and dont care about fuel economy you might pay as much as 3p per mile for fuel. Drive it for economy and less than 2p per mile. at 3p per mile its ¬£57 a month. Also less servicing and cheaper tax as long as you avoid the expensive are surcharge. Then factor in you will be doing 15k miles just for work a year, so maybe 20k including personal use. How long would you keep a car doing that amount of mileage?

Using the ¬£286 and ¬£57 a month thats ¬£13k saving in fuel over 5 years, you can basically buy a fairly good used car for that. And that assuming the new workplace doesnt offer free charging there, which is becoming less common but does still happen, which would make it even more of a no brainer.

P.S. I'll also add every person I have known who did a long daily commute with traffic became a much more aggressive driver as you just want to get home. Expect that to happen so you will want a car that can perform when asked to.

1neyu1r,"Bought car on finance, 2+ months without it, dealer unresponsive ‚Äì what are my rights?","I‚Äôm posting this on behalf of my sister-in-law, as she‚Äôs not on Reddit but really needs advice. Based in the England.

TL;DR: Sister-in-law bought a car (less than 2 years old) on PCP via Santander in March. Dealer said it had full service history and warranty. Within 3 weeks, serious engine issues appeared. Mercedes say no service history exists, no warranty, and it needs a new engine. Dealer unresponsive, car stuck in garage for over 2 months. She has a courtesy car now, but it‚Äôs a downgrade, not like-for-like. Dealer isn‚Äôt replying to her request for a full refund and keeps giving false dates on repair times. Santander (the PCP provider) initially logged a complaint but have since closed it, saying dealership has provided courtesy car and given her an initial completion date (July 25). She‚Äôs worried that if she rejects the car but the dealer ignores her, she‚Äôll still be on the hook for >¬£10k PCP payments to Santander.

‚∏ª

The situation

‚Ä¢ Car bought on PCP finance via Santander at the end of March.

‚Ä¢ Dealer assured her it had a full service history and warranty.

‚Ä¢ Within 3 weeks, rattling noise. Mercedes charged ¬£234 diagnostic fee, said the whole engine needs replacing, and that there‚Äôs no warranty because no service history exists in their records.

‚Ä¢ Dealer disputes this, but communication has been terrible ‚Äî they ignore emails and calls.  
‚Ä¢ The car has now been with Mercedes/Dealer for over 2 months.

‚Ä¢ Courtesy car was finally provided in July, but it‚Äôs not like-for-like (lesser model than what she‚Äôs paying for).

What‚Äôs happened with Santander

‚Ä¢ Complaint was raised with Santander, who at first logged it and said they‚Äôd look at compensation once repairs were done.

‚Ä¢ They then closed the complaint on the basis that the dealer had provided an initial completion date (that‚Äôs passed weeks ago) and a courtesy car was provided (even though this only happened after weeks of pressure and isn‚Äôt like-for-like).

‚Ä¢ She wasn‚Äôt told the complaint was being closed, only found out later, and has received no compensation or resolution.

‚Ä¢ She‚Äôs asked Santander to re-open the case, but they‚Äôre non-responsive and very difficult to reach.

Where she stands legally (as she understands it)

‚Ä¢ Under the Consumer Rights Act, she could have rejected the car outright in the first 30 days, but as she was told Mercedes would repair under warranty, she didn‚Äôt reject the car at the time.

‚Ä¢ After that, the dealer has one chance to repair/replace within a reasonable time. It‚Äôs now been over 2 months with virtually no progress.

‚Ä¢ On that basis, she believes she has the right to reject the car now.

‚Ä¢ She‚Äôs already asked the dealer for a full refund (deposit, monthly payments, diagnostic fee, plus compensation for the downgrade courtesy car), but they aren‚Äôt replying.

The problem

‚Ä¢ If she rejects the car but the dealer doesn‚Äôt engage, she‚Äôs still liable for the remaining PCP balance to Santander (>¬£10k).

‚Ä¢ Santander are being unhelpful, closing the complaint and leaving her in limbo.

‚Ä¢ That makes small claims court useless, because the amount owed is well above ¬£10k.

‚∏ª

Her questions

1. How can she actually enforce rejection of the car if the dealer is ignoring her?
2. Since the car was bought on PCP, should Santander be taking liability here under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act ‚Äî and if so, how can she push them when they‚Äôre shutting her down?
3. What‚Äôs the best practical next step: formal solicitor‚Äôs letter, or something else? (She‚Äôs already reached out to the Motor Ombudsman, but the dealership isn‚Äôt accredited with them so are unable to help)
4. Is there any realistic way to stop Santander from taking further monthly payments while this dispute is ongoing?",1,1757670188.0,5,CartalkUK,1757791887,2025-09-12 09:43:08,2025-09-13 19:31:27,"BaldyBaldyBouncer (Score: 5): r/LegalAdviceUK

1neyjla,Need help purchasing next car,"So I‚Äôve been searching for my next car for the last few weeks. I‚Äôm currently coming up to 6 years of ownership on my first car - 1L Polo. Was a pretty nice car when I got it at 17 and has been pretty reliable overall bar a few bits that went wrong immediately after purchasing but the dealer repaired at no cost, however its now over 100k miles and is 10/11 years old so in the last 2 years, I forked out quite a bit on standard wear and tear + other things. In the last two months specifically, the brakes completely failed and I had to fix an oil leak/ replace water pump which cost me over ¬£500 last month. A month or two before that I had to pay a few hundred to fix another issue I can‚Äôt remember what it was. 

My insurance is up for renewal on 25/09, MOT is due a week later and annual service is due around this time. I also know there‚Äôs not much life left in the clutch, brake pads are wearing thin and suspension is knackered and it‚Äôs overdue timing belt so it‚Äôs time to get out of the car before having to spend however much in the next month or two. 

I‚Äôm looking to purchase a car that I can run for another 5/6 years but I‚Äôm struggling to figure out what the right route to go down is. My budget if I absolutely stretch it is about 13.5k - this includes my car as part ex/ chopping in to a car buying site. I‚Äôd like something a lot bigger but realistically I currently don‚Äôt need a big SUV - something like the size of an X1 would be spot on, anything bigger than that would be overkill. I want something with decent rep for reliability, nice enough interior and decent performance. I‚Äôve looked at 2017 tiguans, 2017 X1‚Äôs, 2015 Lexus NX(looking at 100k+ miles on these), Q3‚Äôs etc etc. 7k of my budget is from a bank loan, I don‚Äôt really want to stretch right to the edge of my budget just to buy a car but I don‚Äôt know what the sweet spot would be. The only thing that‚Äôs swaying me to do so is as I want this car to last me at least 5 years of good ownership.

At that price I‚Äôd always look to buy from private sellers. You can get some PX cars from dealers but I find I can get more for my money from private. You‚Äôll be amazed what you can get if you can afford to take a bit of time over it. If it‚Äôs a case of needing something right now, trickier ask, but still possible with a bit of focus. 

Personally I never aim for a specific make or model, you‚Äôre narrowing the field too much. Set a budget on Autotrader or similar, set any specs that are important to you (e.g. diesel, estate, etc.). Set a filter for distance from you, or milage, depending which is more important to you, and sort the list by the other one. Look for 12m MoT ideally. There are specific models worth avoiding (everyone has their own view on which) so worth looking up model related issues once you‚Äôve got a shortlist of options from the broader search.

For cars that look tempting and you can see the number plate in photos, run an MOT checker which will list advisories and flag potential issues. If you can‚Äôt check MOT history from the advert I tend not to bother unless it looks really juicy in other ways, in which case it‚Äôs the first thing I check when I see it in person either from the paper copy if the seller has it or online if not. 

When you go check a car out, appraise both car and (cruicially) the seller. 

Car first - any rust, nah. Next MoT you‚Äôll probably have to weld her up and that‚Äôs ¬£¬£¬£. There are some places where corrosion isn‚Äôt an big issue or an MoT fail but it‚Äôs too long to go into here. Dings and scratches, faded paint, no prob. 

If you know cars a bit, listen for out of place noises in engine, suspension etc. I always look at the oil and coolant and see if it looks fresh or ancient. Some folks say you can‚Äôt tell, or that a fresh oil change can hide a problem - there‚Äôs truth to that but I always find it a helpful clue. It‚Äôs all about building a picture from a number of data points. Some straight up red flags e.g. signs of oil and water mixing, no go, burning oil, no go, but most of the time I go off a cumulative weight of evidence rather than one or two things. 

Even if you‚Äôre not that confident judging condition of a car, there are loads of ways to get clues about how the car has been maintained. 4 matching tyres from the same brand, plus point (fronts matching and rears matching, also good). Mismatched tyres with different stages of wear = maintained on a tight budget. Is it filthy af or clean, cared for?

Then the owner. If they hand you a wadge of service history, obvs plus points. But there are subtler signs. Have they got multiple cars for sale at once? Probably flipping cars as a side hustle, avoid. Not all folks that do that are dodgy by any means but enough are that it‚Äôs a risk, and a risk I tend not to take. They‚Äôre looking to make some money - I‚Äôm looking for sellers that just want the car gone. How long have they owned it for? Do they own up to the odd bit of damage (e.g ‚Äòterribly sorry the drivers seat arm rest is busted and one of the radio speakers is dead‚Äô) - the things people point to are often irrelevant, but pointing out faults is a good sign. All of this obvs needs caveating - people can bullshit you. Trust your gut. First sign of doubt they‚Äôre not being straight with you, walk away. Plenty more fish. Seller passing the vibe check is super important to me. 

I‚Äôm not really a big negotiator on price tbh - if I think the price is right I‚Äôll buy it - if it‚Äôs a bit steep for what the car is I wouldn‚Äôt be looking at it anyway. I don‚Äôt really see the point of haggling over a few hundred quid. I have got deals in the past when I was a bit more skint by pushing people a bit, but the sweet spot at this price bracket is folks that just want rid of it - price isn‚Äôt a major issue for them anyway and they‚Äôre after a quick sell - situations like more wealthy folks where it was their kid‚Äôs car and they‚Äôve upgraded, or their mum‚Äôs car and she‚Äôs stopped driving (and many other situations besides). If I pull up at a house where there‚Äôs 2 much newer cars in the driveway plus an old banger they want rid of, happy days. 

There will likely be things to fix, that‚Äôs par for the course, but you‚Äôre looking to buy something that will last a couple years without really big bills. Then run it until it don‚Äôt."

Further ETA: Short MOT to February, cheap nasty tyres on the front, and NEVER have things like jump leads, bottles of oil, footpumps etc in pictures. You think it looks like you're well prepared, buyers think 'does it need jump starting often/have a slow puncture/leak oil or coolant?'.

1nevlla,Looking for help sourcing a used car (South London),"Hi all,

I‚Äôm looking for some help sourcing a car and hoping someone here might point me in the right direction. Ideally, I‚Äôd like a Kia Sportage petrol (but open to similar reliable options) with a budget of up to ¬£15k.

With two young kids at home and a very busy job, I simply don‚Äôt have the time or energy or knowledge to do the endless searching, etc ( I have actually tried, and it is overwhelming), and I don't want to be scammed.

What I‚Äôd love is to find someone trustworthy who can help me track down a good, functional car within my budget¬†and actually check the car over to make sure it‚Äôs sound before I commit.

I‚Äôm happy to pay a fair commission for the service if it saves me time and stress.

If you know anyone who offers this kind of service (or if you do it yourself), I‚Äôd really appreciate your recommendations ( I have not been convinced by Rac, the aa....)

1neqjiw,Mazda 3 2.2 SKYACTIV-D SE-L. A mistake to buy?,"As above im looking at getting a Mazda 3. Ive found that the Mazda 3 has been hailed as reliable however not the diesel engine. The one im looking at is a 2016 plate with 80k miles and I cant look past how much cheaper they are compared to similar cars.

Through searching online it seems that people say the main issues with this engine are caused by not doing enough long motorway miles and not keeping the car serviced with oil changes.

I travel 60 miles total on the motorway each day, so am wondering if the notorious issues this engine has will be less likely to affect myself.

On top of this the car has a full service history also and has no concerns regarding the engine on any past MOTs.

Is it a good idea to give this car a chance? Or is the diesel Mazda engine a complete no go?

Any advice is greatly appreciated.",1,1757640967.0,2,CartalkUK,1757791887,2025-09-12 01:36:07,2025-09-13 19:31:27,"Ziemniok_UwU (Score: 3): The Mazda diesels is one of the most problematic diesels out there, there's a reason they are so cheap.

Long journeys may reduce likelihood of issues but these engines are still prone to other problems like turbo failures and head gasket problems.
