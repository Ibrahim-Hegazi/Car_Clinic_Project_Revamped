1. Verified the fluid pump is working OK (fluid is coming out of the nozzles). Pump is making noise. However, could the no mist situation be due to insufficient pressure (or weak pump)? How do I verify this?

2. The diagram for the wiper system from the factory service manual is shown below. Would the above symptom happen if the check valve is malfunctioning? How to verify this?

3. Since both nozzles are showing the same behavior, I don't think the issue is the nozzles themselves or there is blockage after the check valve once the tube splits into Y connection. Is my thinking correct?

I know I have at least a minor engine leak for oil, as my low oil light is on, and it's leaked in the past. But this morning I noticed a trail of fluid while at the gas station and a really nice attendant told me it was antifreeze and pointed out the greenish tint of the puddle.

I can see spots on the ground where I was parked at work yesterday, so it must have also been leaking yesterday. 

My mechanic is only open m-th. I could drop my car off today and just leave it there over the weekend if it's really that unsafe, but I'd prefer not to. I was planning on driving out of the city for pumpkin patch things this weekend :/ Would that be unwise? Could I just go to the store and try adding more fluid myself for now?

If you are driving with the oil light on, you are likely causing significant damage to the engine. It is very low on oil.   A typical engine takes 4 to 6 quarts of oil. When the oil light is on, you're typically at least 2 quarts low.  Possibly much more.  

If the engine is not destroyed and the car is mostly okay, you must check your oil at least every time you fill it up with gas. If it's low, add more oil. If it isn't, you'll get a sense of how often you need to check it, and how often you need to add oil.

The coolant leak is much less of a concern. You can top it off as often as you need to.  That said, I would open the oil fill cap and take a look at the underside of it. If it has stuff in it that looks like peanut butter, or anything that looks like anything other than oil, it is possible that you need a head gasket, and you shouldn't be driving the car either.

1of4iwi,Something’s Shutting Down My ECU - 2012 ES350,"2012 Lexus ES350 with 70k miles. For 2 weeks, I’ve had a problem where it will start then after shut down, it won’t crank. The battery and starter are brand new, the starter works if I jump the start relay but that’s it. When it starts, it lights up the MIL and there’s a TRAC OFF notice on the display. If i disconnect the negative cable, wait 15 minutes then try a restart it usually starts again. If I switch to ON without starting and the warnings come on after 5 seconds, it usually won’t start. I’m getting 4 codes for MAF, Intake Air, Throttle pedal and Crank Sensor. I figured there was some sort of fault in the 5V reference and disconnected all one at a time, except the crank sensor which isn’t accessible until I remove the alternator and AC compressor. Also, the fans kick on if I pull the IG2 relay, but I think that’s supposed to happen as a fail-safe since it powers the ECM. 

I’ve checked grounds, looked for frayed wires and I’m trying to find a way to test the crank sensor but it runs just fine. I could drive it cross country as long as I didn’t turn it off. Once it fails, comms at the OBD2 port also go dead. I tried to do a CAN bus scan, but can’t scan anything or look at live data because comms die. So I’m flying blind. I’ve already dug through all similar cases on my DIY Identifix subscription and nothing is close. It’s always no crank period, never this very specific pattern of crank/ no crank.

I'm thinking next step disconnect battery tonight and see if it again drops from 12.6 to 12.4V to distinguish between faulty battery and parasitic draw?

Also read that some alternators may not put out high enough voltage to effectively charge AGM batteries. Is 14V at idle normal for the alternator?

1of1adv,2014 428i N20 - P2096 codecaused by midgrade fuel?,"Hello,

I am a hobbyist with limited experience and amatuer troubleshooting skills. My mother has a 2014 BMW 428i with the n20 engine. Her car threw a CEL with a P2096 code (Post catalyst fuel trim system too lean). When I was visitng her, I pulled the oil cap off at idle, which caused a change in idle and sucked a substatial amount of air into the crankcase. It seemed to me to have excessive vacuum presen in the crankcase at idle. This leads me to suspect PCV valve being stuck open.

She took it to her mechanic who has been generally trustworthy and good to deal with. She was told that it was not the PCV system, that if it were, it would be a different trouble code. They told her that the problem was caused by ""midgrade gas"" (she always fills it with the recommended 93 octane). Which doesn't make any sense to me, for a variety of reasons.

Code itself needs diagnosing instead of just randomly guessing the cause.

But best approach would be to monitor live data from the engine and see how everything reacts to changes in A/F mixture

If it does fire, look underneath for leaks- watch to make sure you have oil pressure- pull the transmission stick and make sure the level is in the cold area. Let it idle for a while and warm up- feel the heater hoses- they should be getting warm and hot as the engine warms up. Once the upper radiator hose starts getting hot, go ahead and shut it off and change the oil and filter. Change all the fluids- brake fluid, front and rear diff fluid, power steering fluid, do a transmission filter service and only replace the fluid that comes out when dropping the pan, after that run ethanol free gas with some fuel injection cleaner or techron for the first few tanks and you should be good- keep an eye out for leaks.

if you can increase the horse power within reason, and change the rear end gearing a bit, you could probably increase your mileage drastically.

modern fuel injection, better flowing head, increase the compression or install a power-adder like a turbo or supercharger, these are all things that can increase the efficiency of the engine which help drive up the mileage.

now, you said that you fixed a coolant leak, drove it until ""something happened"", but did not specify what that something is. did it appear to spring another leak?

the only way for there to be too much pressure in the cooling system is either because your expansion tank cap is not properly venting, or a blown head gasket is allowing compression to enter the system. did you get the aluminum coolant flange from ECS? if so, that is a good kit. the plastic cooling components on the older Audi's are known to get brittle with age, so its possible something else failed."

I was previously getting post cat o2 sensor and lean mixture codes but the car ran well, no problems at all for a couple of months. Then suddenly it started misfiring on multiple cylinders with a rough idle, blinking check engine, rough acceleration, but smooth when I'm driving.

I changed the spark plugs, swapped the ignition coil positions, did a sound check with a screwdriver on the injectors, all seems fine. When I cleaned the MAF sensor with a cleaner, the lean codes went away but the misfiring is still there.

Today I was checking the vanos solenoids. When I removed the connector from one, the car started getting lower revs and even rougher idle, I guess that it's a sign that it's working. But the other one didn't, the car just kept working as usual. I took them out and cleaned them but it didn't change anything. Maybe I should try swapping their positions? I don't have a multimeter so I can't check that

1oeq2hq,Cooling system (upper hose under vacuum/sucking itself flat),"Question about cooling system.

I have a 2010 Volkswagen Routan (dodge caravan).  I’ve been a tech at multiple dealerships and then moved to race cars. I’m vary familiar with mechanics in general. But now that I don’t work in any shop, the testers for radiator cap and thermostat I no longer have.  I fear that I may just want to replace the radiator anyway and try to flush the engine. The back story is this is now a 15 year old van with 260k miles and at this point only gets driven once every 3 weeks for so for 1 hour drive. Coolant is around 4-5 years old and 60k miles. I haven’t changed it since one of my heater hoses exploded.  

My current question. Last time I drove it, I noticed coolant dripping when I got home. Open the hood to see the overflow tank full and the drip was from coolant leaking slightly from the hose next to the radiator cap, but also the upper main hose from radiator to thermostat was being vacuumed sucked flat. It was not fully flat yet but was sucked in.  The temp gauge was still reading 200-205, not showing over heating.   After it cooled down it had sucked the coolant back into the system and the overflow was still filled right to the “add” and when I pulled the cap off, the radiator was full.  Without being able to test anything, I want to change the cap (because I couldn’t feel the spring doing anything when I took it off. It turned way to easy and didn’t feel like it was locking into place with pressure against the spring like a cap normally does). And I want to change the thermostat just in case it is stuck closed and that’s why the upper line was getting sucked in by a vacuum.  

The hose sucking in is throwing me off as I know there is a vacuum in the system, but I have personally never seen it in real life over my years of working. Do you guys think it’s probably the thermostat, or do you think I should go ahead and change the radiator and try to blow the engine out with some air. Do you think the system is blocked because of a clog or blocked from thermostat?   Some coolant has been flowing as all lines were hot to the touch and engine had been running for about 40 minutes.

The radiator cap pressurizes the cooling system and releases excess pressure, not cause vacuum. If it was drawing coolant back in, then it's working properly. 

The thermostat doesn't cause a vacuum and cause the hose to collapse when the engine is cold and it won't when hot either. If anything, it will cause the pressure to rise due to heat and will also cause overheating.

When was the last time the radiator hoses were changed? They get soft with age and can collapse. 

If that doesn't fix it, then a cooling system flush is in order. If the flow through the radiator is that restricted after a flush, then replace the radiator."

Anyway – he noticed that two of the three wires going into the black box shown in the photos are completely cut off. Only one cable is still connected.

1of2nzg,Filling pitted steering rack shaft with JB Weld,"Witness me. Perhaps I'm a fool. I did not want to replace the whole rack... I found a torn steering boot filled with tetanus soup which successfully corroded many pits into the rack shaft, ultimately damaging the PS rack end seal, so it leaks steering fluid. Unfortunately if the rusty steering lines (and fasteners) on the rack are disturbed on this old Buffalo car, they will surely rupture. So here I am, cleaned and filled the pitting with JB weld, and very carefully wet (oil) sanding it down to a polish. Photos 4+5 are just after 1000 grit and before the 2000 grit sanding and subsequent polishing. I have the replacement end seals and boot ready to go. 😅 Thoughts?

So I bought some PS safe UV Dye, let it run a few days, and jacked the front end after dusk.

This was right behind the driver side tire. It looks like the Power Steering rack? The boot looks intact (although I couldn't quite get in to see or feel behind the edge). It almost looks like its leaking from the seal of two components at the very top most of the assembly (you should be able to spot a thin line of concentrated fluid in the images there.). 

I'm no mechanic, but as an IT professional I've found serious overlap in the ability of good physicians, good IT technicians, and good mechanics and their ability to research and work back through a scenario. I dont own a lift, but I have a 3-ton jack to lift the front end up. Would this, hand tools, and a knack for cursing at all hours in my driveway with persistence be enough to replace the power steering rack?

I'll list every single spot I've checked, maybe you guys will have some better ideas on where I could be lol. Car is a 2013 toyota corolla

Places I've checked:

\- Spare tire bay and every part of the trunk

\- Both glove boxes

\- Every door panel pocket

\- Behind the passenger's seat pocket (driver does not have one)

\- Under every floor mat

\- Engine bay

\- Under both front seats

\- Trunk, under the mat in the trunk

\- Folded down the back seats, you just see the trunk when you do that

\- Shoved my hand between where the back of the seat meets the seat

\- Center console

\- All the cup holders

\- Took out the driver's seat to check all the crevices. There aren't really any crevices but I found 75 cents so I guess it was worth my time

\- Between front seats and center console crevices 

Edit: guys I found it. It was in the driver's side door pocket. It was standing up, on its side, in the side closer to the cabin of the car so you can't see it.

He suggested that he could use a rust converter on it for me, but I've read that might just cause more trouble. I also thought about taking it to a place that would clean and use fluid film or a lanolin based application it, but it would cost a minimum of $500.

I don't really want to spend more on this car. it's only 127k miles, but had lots of issues, and I still haven't replaced the head gaskets (no issues with it yet but I know I'll have to eventually). I want to use it for another year or so, or however long I can safely use it without spending thousands more on it.

what would you recommend I do?

Putting it in gear just increases friction to make it a little tougher to move, but gravity on a slope will overcome that friction and your car will roll. This goes for any manual car.

Also, your engine has no compression in it when it's not running. The cars are never going to ""hold their own weight"" (not 100% sure what you mean by that?). The parking brake is meant for holding the car still while its parked, so just use it and don't think about it lol

1of38ho,Almost my nightmare scenario,"Storytime.



Today on my drive to work I decided I'll take my truck (2002 dodge ram 1500) since I haven't driven it in several weeks.  Starts up fine, I just replaced the battery over the summer.  Work is only 20min/12 miles away.





The drive there was perfectly normal.  I get to my work parking lot, several left and right turns just fine.  I stop to back into a parking spot and as I'm backing up and gently putting my foot on the brake, the pedal goes to the floor before it starts to slow the truck.   





I get it into the parking spot and start inspecting the engine/brake fluid tank/brake master cylinder.  I spot what at first I thought was a leak coming from the brake booster, the underside was wet.  Looked further down to find the real culprit.  In the driver side wheel well I find the problem.  See picture.





The pipe is so rusted it is actually broken clean off inside of the torn hose and I could see active dripping from the torn hose.

Cadillac 2.0T can be good but many say it's disappointing for the money. Idk much about the CTS coupe but the 3.6L has been in a lot of GM vehicles so... and the Challenger will most likely be abused and cause headaches.

if you're concerned about reliability 9/10 times Japanese is the way to go, the Q50 with the 3.7L is one of the best NA V6s to come out of Japan and is a tank, you also get a lot of power down to all wheels. I believe the earlier Q50 models need to have transmission valve bodies replaced at higher KMs but it's not super expensive.

1oel5x0,Looking for your expertise,"Hey everyone, new to this world.  just brainstorming some ideas, so please take everything I say as purely hypothetical.

Imagine a setup with ESP32-based modules that can operate in two modes: **Standalone** or **Slave**.

* In **Standalone mode**, each module connects directly to the OEM CAN network, sniffing data and performing specific actions based on selected parameters.
* In **Slave mode**, the modules communicate over an **AUX CAN network**, where a **Master module** handles OEM CAN sniffing and coordinates actions across the connected Slaves.

Now, I have a few questions:

1. Would you use a **local ESP32 web server** for configuring each module when running in Standalone mode?
2. What kind of **hardware** would you choose for the **Master module**, considering it needs to handle a server, AUX CAN (Slaves), and OEM CAN at the same time?
3. For the **Slave modules**, would you stick with something like an **ESP32-C5 or ESP32-P4**, or would you consider a different chip?
4. Is there a better approach to handle **on the fly configuration** of **Standalone** mode modules?.  Something that doesn’t require switching between multiple Wi-Fi networks just to reconfigure another device?

I'm assuming this is for a personal project with a particular car in mind. if thats the case, then you can choose arbitrary IDs for your own messages (this is what I've done) and the IDs I've chosen wont conflict with the IDs in use by my Nissan Leaf. In general the ID#s have an implied priority by their number - as in the 0x100s have a higher priority than the 0x500 series, and messages that are related to engine timing, safety systems, brakes etc tend to be in the 0x100 range. Heating and cooling in the 200s... and so on.  By picking a number in the 0x600s to 0x700s you're sure to be broadcasting with a ""low priority"".

I too have been struggling with how to best configure the ESP32s CanBus parameters dynamically. Ive tried the Bluetooth Low Energy route and had all kinds of firmware/BT-versioning issues. I've abandoned that route for now. I considered setting up each ESP with its own web-server... meh... just got too crazy because you have to get them all on the same WiFi network in the first place --- for me that meant using my phone as a wifi point... then comes the problem of how do you identify which IP address was allocated to which device... solvable but messy.

Some of the ESP Dev boards support the MeshNetwork - thats a possibility too. But, I've already done too many side-quests, and I want to get things done.

At the moment my plan is to use a rasberry pi + (python Flask web server on localhost) to host the main dash gauge. if I've plugged a mouse/kybd into its exposed USB port, then allow a configuration screen. And the configuration screen would send a set of custom canbus messages that set configuration params. Each ESP would listen for these configuration changes and update its local NVM memory. And the apps in the ESP would use the config values meaningful to it and ignore the others (for example, if I have an ESP thats interested in monitoring Oil Temp, it could listen for ""0x710:Set Oil Temp Warning Color"", ""0x711:Set Oil Temp Danger Color"", and so on. Also you should know that a canbus packet is only 8 bytes long - you will have to be working at the bit level for data."
1ofdalt,Replaced rear main seal,"So, I purchased this 2002 GMC Yukon from my neighbor and I had to replaced the rear main oil seal on the crankshaft. I completed the repair and I reinstalled the transmission, while I was bolting the torque convertor to the flexplate, I noticed fresh metal shaving like the flexplate is rubbing on the bell housing of the transmission. So, I thought maybe I put the flexplate on backwards. So, I pulled the transmission again. The wear from the torque convertor matches the side of the flexplate that is facing it. So, I must have it installed correctly. I have no idea why the flexplate is rubbing the inside of the bell housing, does any one have advice on this issue?

1ofcrs8,Regular Gas In Premium Car,"Vehicle: 2014 VW Tiguan
Gas: Premium (required)

So I bought this car new and have ran it to 127,000km with 87 gas instead of the 91 it requires. With the information I researched at the time my understanding was that the only downside was that I would have to clean my intake valves more frequently. Since the fuel cost difference over 300,000 was projected at $5k and I can clean the intake myself, I figured it was worth the trade off. Besides it’s just my basic car to get to me to work. 

Fast forward to today I am now seeing more people warning about knock and suggesting this would damage the engine. So I am thinking of changing my ways. However…

The car is running perfect. I have had no mechanical issues whatsoever. Aside from the gas I take exceptional care of the car. 

From what I can tell my engine is not knocking on 87 and sounds exact same as running 91. I even put a Db meter on it and there is no change whatsoever. Furthermore, the 10-20% better gas mileage many claim… I see absolutely no change in my case. My morning commute is 8.5l/100 regardless of fuel.

So what do I do. Go with 91 to be safe or just keep rolling the dice on 87? I know the knock sensor is probably saving me, but is it problematic to rely on the computer to make changes to account for el cheapo gas?

I’ve narrowed my choices down to three SUVs Prado 150, Pajero Sport, and Fortuner.

After doing some research on Reddit, ChatGPT, and Google:
	•	Pajero Sport – seems to have reliability issues, users have complained about minor problems time to time.
	•	Prado – great vehicle, but high maintenance and less affordable.
	•	Fortuner – seems the most affordable overall.

So I’m leaning toward a 2018–2019 Fortuner with under 150k km (~$36k).

1ofaub1,2016 Kia Sorento blower motor doesn’t work/control panel question.,"I’ve been having a problem with my 2016 Kia Sorento’s blower motor.

It’s worth to note that before this happened me and my brother checked the Freon levels for the ac and it was virtually empty. I drove it around that night and it pumped air but when I went to use it a couple days later it didn’t work at all (ac or heat)

Anyways to continue with the issue…

The motor doesnt work on any setting but works when plugged in to external power (I got it going with a 9 volt battery). I first replaced the resistor cause it was rather rusted but that didn’t fix it. I then checked with a multimeter and realized the motor is only receiving 7-8 volts (requires 12v) on all settings 0-4. I tried checking the resistor by setting it to ohms on the meter but numbers drastically jump all over the place and states OL (overload) so if I don’t have that on the right setting so I’d appreciate some advice. Anyways, I checked all the fuses and they’re in working order. I guess all I have left is to check to see if the control panel is at fault or some of the connecting leads for the motor/resistor though they appear to be fine aswell.

One thing I wanted to do was pop out the control panel but I’m not entirely sure how. I’ve seen on some different years or models they just pop out or have to be removed with a screwdriver by taking off the dashboard shield. There just hasn’t been a video uploaded with my specific make so I don’t want to go trying to pop it out and damage it. So if anyone has had experience with that in respect to the 2016 Kia sorento please let me know.

And in regards to the overall issue I’d take any advice. Hoping to get an old but new control panel at a wreckers and see if that fixes it.

Learn to change oil on your own if you don't like taking the car to a dealer and scheduling it. it's not guaranteed to make a car lost tons longer, but by changing oil often, you have oil that's in a spec designed for the engine rather than a bunch of baked out water full of oxidized particles and potentially abrasive stuff."

Now I make this post to ask whether to use an actually good set of coilovers, or good/oem struts and lowering springs. The r/cars sub seems to be split on the subject, with one post saying that if you're going for aesthetic, the responses were overwhelmingly in favor of lowering springs, and another post was strongly against it.

In the latter post, the responses seemed to lightly disagree, saying that lowering springs are good if done right. Can I just have a general consensus before I drop 1000 into either option?

Manufacturers with aftermarket coilovers (not ebay special) design their shocks to work with the springs to provide a good ride quality, safe components, and proper clearances. When buying lowering springs you want to look at linear springs vs progressive springs. Progressive get stiffer as they compress more and decide what kind of ride quality/performance you are looking for. Some springs have weight capacities that you also don't want your vehicle to exceed. 

It is best to see the spring manufacturers notes on compatibility with the oem shocks and suspension equipment if you're just looking for lowering springs. There is more to it but this is the gist."

Of course it's the same PCD (5x108). both cars are rated to mount 205 mm wide tyres (the puma's are little taller, 65 vs 60).

ford's official site says that the puma rims are not compatible with my focus but it seems bogus to me. as far as I understand, the only difference would be that my wheelbase would be 5 mm larger on each size, being this (as far as I understand) a positive ET rim. which shouldn't be a big deal.  
  
maybe if I did the opposite, IE install the focus rims on a puma, I would risk interference with the brakes and the steering (but 5 mm is such a small difference that maybe it won't even matter).

The cranking feels heavy as if something was blocking the starter motor, but when we unplug the ECU it cranks normally endlessly. We dropped the gearbox to check the clutch was installed properly.

Battery is old but charged and we even tried with a booster pack. Got a fault code for ""Engine start blocked by immobilizer"" although no fault codes from the Immobilizer module.

When scanning again after trying I also got a Short to ground on the Fuel pump relay and on the 4 injectors.

It sometimes starts for a second after letting go of the key when cranking but that's it. We checked the pump was getting power and it does when cranking but not when ignition is on, but we suspect the Immobilizer is the reason for that.

Most likely it will require a resync of the key(s). Some people decide to bypass the immobilizer, but it takes an experienced tech or a bypass module and isn't recommended. 

If there is a PIN in the owner's manual or a spare key, try those first. 

Next, check the main grounding straps, there are usually a handful of them. After that, test or swap the fuel pump relay with another and try again. (I'm assuming you fixed the short already.)

Pull an injector and see if it's pulsing fuel, check the fuel pressure at the rail, and check to see if the fuel pump has voltage with the key in the ON position, not just when cranking or priming. 

Pull a spark plug and verify it's got spark by grounding it to the block while cranking or with a spark plug test light. 

Check the wiring harness visually and for continuity on the fuel injector and fuel pump circuit. 

More likely than not, it's the anti-theft system, which can cut fuel or spark, not sure which in this case, but that's typically how they work. You should look that up on that specific model.

Just to be thorough, ensure the battery has 12.6v and maintains 10v when cranking and that the connections are clean and tight.

This is all assuming the clutch and flywheel are installed properly and the crank/camshaft sensors are all connected and functioning.

Good luck with it. Hopefully, you can borrow a bidirectional scan tool to sync the key if that turns out to be the problem. If not, locksmiths or a shop can do it."

I took the car for a 10 min spin in the city, after about 4 weeks of standing still in the garage. Just before I was about to park it again, I noticed a rather large leak under the transmission/dashboard area (see video).

These are the things I tried to diagnose what was going on:

* Tasted the fluid: tasted like water to me, no remarkable taste
* Checked levels or oil and 3 other reservoirs (I will try to post pictures in a comment)
* I check the parking spot in my garage. There were no puddles from before I took the car for a spin
* Leak was coming out from an undercarriage plastic cover first, but in the video looked like it was now also dripping from an adjacent metal piece
* There was some minor condensation coming out from the exhaust pipe from the start, which I deemed normal

The car is being serviced regularly, no defered maintenance that I know of.

I would assume it was condesnation, but as you see in the video, the leak is rather major. Thoghts?

1oendyh,Mitsubishi Mirage Issues?,"Let’s see if anyone here can help me out with their knowledge — no offense meant to anyone. So, I bought a 2015 Mirage (3-cylinder, 1.2L, ES version) on Monday. When I got it, it had about a quarter tank of gas, which lasted me all Monday and part of Tuesday. When I was about to run out, I stopped at a gas station that I’d had a bad experience with before — but the gas was cheap, so that’s on me. I filled it up there. For anyone wondering why I say this because I live in México and fuel is known to be contaminated/mixed with water in some gas stations where gas is cheap

A few hours later, the car started knocking and shaking, like it was misfiring on one cylinder. I immediately thought it was contaminated gas, so I bought a Lucas octane booster and a Lucas injector cleaner, added both, and the issue went away. That was Tuesday.

On Wednesday, everything was fine until the evening, when it started acting up again — felt like a cylinder misfire, shaking, almost stalling. By then, I’d used about a quarter tank of what I assume was bad gas, so I went to my usual gas station (the one I never have problems with) and added 8 liters of premium to try to dilute the bad gas. It seemed to stabilize again.

That was yesterday (Wednesday). Today (Thursday) it ran fine all day, but at night it started doing the same thing again. So I added another 7 liters of premium, more octane booster, and more injector cleaner. At this point, the tank is about half premium and half of what I think is contaminated gas — but now it kept misfiring.

I noticed it runs fine until I put it in reverse — then it starts shaking badly and misfiring, and even when I shift back to Drive, it doesn’t go away right away. After a few minutes of driving, it smooths out again, but every time I put it in reverse, it acts up badly.

Before I got home, I stopped by the supermarket, and when I tried to start it again, it would start and then die immediately — not even a second later. It did that three times in a row. I was about to call a tow truck, but I tried one more time, and it started fine and stayed running. I drove home and parked it, and I’m just leaving it off for now.

Honestly, it sucks. I don’t know what’s going on. I thought it was the gas, but after everything I’ve added, I don’t think that’s it anymore. I’ll keep filling up with premium until I get to 100% clean gas (about 34 liters total), but I’m not sure what else could be causing this.

The car has had only one owner, 136k miles, no warning lights on the dash, and when I scanned it, it only showed an ABS speed sensor code. As an extra note, today I changed the transmission oil and filter (just the 2.2 liters that drain from the pan). I used genuine Mitsubishi ATF from a reputable seller on Ebay, so I doubt that’s the issue — but mentioning it just in case.

Honestly, I’m a bit down about it. I’d been wanting this car for months, checked it carefully with a buddy who’s a great mechanic, it has full dealer service history, and it looks immaculate. I loved it when I bought it Monday, but now I’m starting to get disappointed. From everything I’d read, these little cars were supposed to be super reliable 😕 Hopefully someone here has dealt with something similar and can point me in the right direction.

1ofaxpq,(video) 130i Driving Experience,"A lot of people asked about the 130i after my recent post ranking the 18 “performance” cars I’ve driven by pure driving enjoyment. I placed it 3rd, just behind a 1000bhp built M140i and the Renaultsport Mégane RS 265 — and honestly, that says a lot.

The 130i is a genuinely special car. It’s hard to describe until you’ve driven one. Built during what many consider BMW’s golden era, it’s essentially a compact 1 Series hatch with a naturally aspirated straight-six (the glorious N52) pushing out 261bhp. Pair it with a 6-speed manual and a backbox delete, and it’s pure magic — one of those drives that feels alive in your hands.

Modern cars might be faster, but very few come close to the 130i’s balance, noise, and connection. It’s raw, mechanical, and properly engaging.

I’ve been hunting for another ever since I sold mine — but finding a clean, well-maintained manual in the UK these days is basically chasing a unicorn.

1ofasnv,Help please. How did this damage happen during wheel alignment?,"Took my car, 2008 Peugeot 107, in for wheel alignment today. At a garage with very good reviews, alignment done well and good service received. 

Was given the car back after it was reversed out of the garage, engine still running, drivers door open ready to drive away. 

When home, I immediately noticed this dent on the offside rear passenger door, behind driver's door. It's not a scrape but a square-on knock and a below is a small hole/chip in the door.  I'm very confident it wasn't there before, I did oil top up and window clean 3 days ago and would have noticed it then as that side of the car has no exisitng damage. When driving, that area is about 10cm to the right of my right buttock so I would know if I'd hit something driving and I've not been anywhere with any obstacle that could do that. Too deep a dent for another car's door knocking into my car in my opinion.

Anyone with mechanic or wheel alignment knowledge be able to speculate how this could have happened at the garage during the alignment? It was alignment only, no tyre fitting.

I will raise this with the garage but some knowledge about how this may have happened would be very useful. If anyone has experience, what would be the best way to approach the garage about this? It is difficult for me to prove the damage wasn't there before.

1of9ech,Need a new(ish) estate- Peugeot 308 or Vauxhall Astra?,"I've reached that point in life - started out with a Golf mk1 and have had increasingly 'sensible' but still fun cars ever since, but I have finally conceded that practicality wins out and with aging parents to ferry about and two dogs - I need an estate.

Don't want an SUV - I've always had small cars and they're much easier on country lanes around me etc, but I need a good boot to transport the dogs in. It's also the first time in my life I will be spending significant money on a nearly-new car, instead of getting a 10+ year old bargain so I'm keen to get it right, but I don't really know what I'm doing so really grateful for any advice. 

Needs to be pretty fuel efficient and as environmentally friendly as possible given I've nowhere to charge it, so no point getting a plug-in. Still needs to be fun to drive and have a decent acceleration though. Also needs to be an automatic, which I've not had before so that'll be an interesting transition. Ideally also can mostly park itself because I'm sick of bollards and lampposts assaulting me in tight spaces!

I've narrowed it down to a 2023(ish) Peugeot 308 or Vauxhall Astra - was leaning towards the Peugeot, but then someone told me if it needs replacement parts they're really expensive/hard to get and that put me off.

As the title says, I want to buy something fun ideally for under 10k. 
The criteria: 
- Preferably a coupe or convertible
- Has to be manual
- Running costs can’t be extortionate e.g. no £800 road tax
- I don’t want to lose a substantial amount of money on the car. My logic is that the market for performance cars should in theory be lower as it’s winter and then it’ll be easier to find a buyer when I sell the car next spring / summer - and this should hopefully consume some of the running costs. 
- Need to get insured on it as a 19yr old. I’ve got quotes on cars like a 996 and s2000 which are unreasonable. Ideally under £2k for the year. I live in a low crime area, 2 years NCB coming soon and my parents as named drivers for context.

I’ve personally owned three from this list (a 2017 S3, a 2006 130i, and a Stage 1 2014 428i - added photos of these above), and had solid seat time in the rest.

This list is ranked purely on how much fun each car was to drive — not just speed or numbers, but the overall experience. I’ve also included bhp per ton for context (stock unless stated).

I know some of these rankings might raise eyebrows — or spark a few debates — but that’s half the fun. Curious to see where you’d agree, disagree, or completely flip the order.

So… which of these do you think deserves to be higher or lower?

I have noticed my car has been making a bike chain like noise sometimes when I’m letting off the accelerator (engine braking). This noise will stop if I put the clutch down after a second, and the noise will slow in rate in 4th gear (higher gear). I have also noticed the noise mostly appears when I’m driving the car harder than normal. Also, the gears make a bit of a cranking noise when changing in low gears.

I have attached a link of the chain like noise here, https://share.icloud.com/photos/0d4VNJRxloRjIDCkA50vqN6gA

I just took my car into a German car specialist garage and they test drove it. They said when moving off the car judders and the gears are also stiff. So they have said the clutch and flywheel need replacing which will cost around £1,500 in parts and labour (4 hour job). 

When I asked whether this was what was causing the noise I believe they said they think so.

1oezces,Need help evaluating price of VR6 with Audi A3 attached,"I have an Audi A3 3.2 v6 Quattro from 2004 that I would appreciate some help getting an evaluation for. The reason that I can't just look at similar cars on the classifieds is that the electrics in this car are beyond the point of repair (ECU got fried by a robbery attempt and the car has been slowly losing it's mind). It's now at a point where the car draws so much electrical power that it needs to be jump started after each use. I took it to a garage who's advice was to sell it asap. In their words ""The electrics are chaos"".

  
The car is in otherwise good condition, only 70,000 miles and mechanically runs really well. The car has 3.2 VR6 engine with dual clutch transmission (all working well) as well as good brakes, 4 summer tyres and 4 winter tyres. But it's pretty much undrivable now so it would need to be sold for parts. Looking for some advice what I should ask for it. ChatGPT says around 1500-2000 euro,

Car is now in Germany since I imported here, but I bought it in UK with RHS as I'm originally from the UK and emigrated recently. Curious for what it would go for in the UK and I'll just try something similar here. I have a potential buyer interested who is expecting a haggle around 2000 euro which I'd be pretty happy with given its undriveable.

Thanks!

I suspected that one of my front alloys had a buckle due to wheel wobble at around 60mph and feeling a floaty unplanted feeling at high speed so I asked an ATS tech to take a look at them when he was fitting new PS5s last week. He fitted the new tyres and afterwards I asked him if they'd balanced up ok and he said yes no problems; So I thought Ok I'll give them a run to see how they feel and told him I'd be back in about a week for alignment.

A quick spin and it was apparent that the wobble was still there so today I'm back at the same ATS for alignment asking them to take another look at the front wheels. This time a different tyre fitter calls me into the shop to show me a massive buckle wobble on the inside of one of the rims as it's spinning on the balancer. 

Anyway he does what he can to zero balance the wheel again as best he can and then off I go to a local wheel repair shop to get the buckle straightened out. After that and another quick high speed spin, presto my wheel wobble problem is fixed.

I'm assuming for ease that this example is stripping interest out. £30k to buy is your outright price. If you put £5000 down, your loan is now £25000. The agreement will then be structured by x amount of payments, followed by the GFV (which is a rubbish term for a baloon payment) at the end. In your example, the agreement would be structured as £208 x 24 (£4992) followed by a GFV of £20,008 and a nominal option to purchase fee.

The ""idea"" behind PCP is that they predict, in your example, the car will be worth maybe £21k. The difference between the GFV and what the car would actually sell for to a dealer is what you get as a deposit; in your example, £992. If the actual value of your car is £19k, then you hand the car back to the finance company and start again - it ""theoretically"" shields you from the car depreciating more than expected.

However, you put a big up front payment in there and you lose it, it becomes part of your two years running costs.

PCP is glorified leasing which gives you the option to buy at the end, *if* it is in your best interests to do so. It generally only works out to be cost effective vs a lease when there's a) huge manufacturer discounts and b) 0% interest. At the moment, that tends to mean cheap EVs because they're desperate to flog them.

If you want to change the car every few years, just lease it. It'll invariably be cheaper, especially if you're prepared to take whatever you can get. Get on [leasing.com](http://leasing.com), set a filter for the amount you wanna pay, put down the smallest up front amount you can get away with and see what comes up.

If you want to own it at the end, buy a year old or two year old car with a low rate loan from the bank. That way you aren't being hammered with up front depreciation.

I just bought my first car — a 2016 Mazda3 — from a small dealer in the Midlands for about £7000. I picked it up yesterday and was driving it back to Manchester when, about an hour and a half into the journey, it broke down on the M6.

To be fair, the seller seemed really genuine throughout. When I first went to see the car, he let me test drive it alone, didn’t ask for anything, and came across as honest and straightforward. I asked if he could change the brake pads and do a wheel alignment before I collected it — he did both and even sent me videos of the work being done without me asking.

The car itself looked really well cared for — clean inside and out, good service history, and seemed properly looked after, which is part of why I felt confident buying it.

At the moment, it looks like it might be an alternator issue, but not 100% sure yet. The dealer has offered to pay for the recovery, pick the car up, fix it, and then deliver it back to me. He’s also said that after I’ve tried it for a few days, if I’m not happy, he’ll refund me and take the car back.

I could go on and on, but finally, the looks. With a set of nice wheels, they are gorgeous cars and I think they've aged like fine wine. Especially when you see the absolute dog shite design at the moment amongst modern cars. 

I will say though that there are common problems, such as the valve tube seals leak and leak oil into the spark plug tubes which flood the ignition coils which eventually fail. You'll get a misfire. There are kits available to fit but I'd get a specialist to do the work personally. 

They're heavy at 1500kg ish so suspension wear and tear is usual, particularly the banana arms being the most common. They love to rot too but both mine were mint so I think it's luck of the draw a lot of the time. The sound system can play up but it's usually a capacitor (I believe) in the sub woofer behind the driver's seat. Again, easy enough to sort. 

All in all though, they are incredible cars for the money and don't listen to the neigh sayers who will say it's not a sports car etc. Go drive one, and see what I'm on about. And I'm a bmw guy through and through and it's not even a consideration between a E90 330i and a 350z. 

One last thing. If you get a 350z, put an induction kit on and listen to the induction roar...but don't blame the car if you get done for speeding... though!

1oem3z3,Is300H replacement,"Hey all,

Looking for a replacement for my 2020 is300H

Had a change in my position at work and I need to get something bigger for both carrying kit and picking up the kids on weekends (could be a 400 mile drive each time on occasion) and up to 20000 miles a year.


I've got a budget of 20k and So far I've shortlisted a 330E estate, A6 estate, e class estate, mustang Mach e/Audi etron (though I've got no home charger) and I'm not a huge fan of the NX that would be a Lexus step up.

Main things I'm looking for are reliability (I know I've added German cars :/) and fuel economy, but I'm not looking at a 2.0 or less as I like the oomph. Had a dodge charger before this so you can see why they're my main ones 😂.


Any suggestions?

From your options A6 is definitely the best daily. Id also add a Volvo V90 as a worthwhile consideration. A Lexus ES is very nice too but not all that much bigger than the IS.

OriginalQuackers (Score: 4): That’s a tough one because the Lexus is such a step above everything else. The only one I would consider acceptable out of those is the E-Class.

I take it an ES or maybe take two steps into an RX is out of the question? "
1oelc8a,I don’t think I’ll ever complain about the states of the roads here again,"I’ve been road tripping from one end of Canada to the other and the roads here are almost diabolical compared to back home. Imagine the worst part of the M25, that horrible concrete section down near the A3 or the terrible part up the top end near Enfield. Ok now imagine that is somehow 100 times worse and it goes on for hundreds of kilometres. 

You do get good sections which are snooker table smooth but then it goes back to horrible broken asphalt or concrete.

1oejv75,Why have cars coloured like pond silt become so ubiquitous?,"For quite some time now most car manufacturers have muted down their colour range to the point where everything is a variation on 'goose sh\*t green' or 'pond silt'. I could understand it if it were a few maverick marques trying to look individual, but the old 'black white or red' basic range has given way to whole streets that look like a washed out pathé newsreel.

It occurs to me that these unsaturated greyish cars merge almost perfectly with a dull British streetscape at dusk, and that combined with the silent electric acceleration makes crossing the road just that bit more risky.",79,1761265923.0,52,CartalkUK,1761420802,2025-10-24 00:32:03,2025-10-25 19:33:22,"overcooked_biscuit (Score: 37): It is easier to sell a used car in a conservative colour than a wild in your face bright yellow for most cars with only some sports cars and small funky cars being the exception. This has an impact on people who are the buyers of new cars as most new buyers plan on trading the car in after a few years and the trade price affects how much they will need to put down on their next car. 
A significant share of people opt for a model of ownership where they're not buying the car outright with the intention to keep it long term and this has resulted in the market being made up of mostly mute colours. 
Now you can only go so long selling a black, white, or grey cars before people get bored and market research has found new buyers want their new car to look different than what is already on the road. The outcome is these slightly off green and grey cars with pond slit paint have become fashionable for now as they're different enough without being too bold. 

Slightly off topic but I remember reading a post from someone who used to work on the corporate side of BMW talking about what customers want and expect. The research suggested customers wanted something new in design over something good looking as they want their car to make a statement which screams out im new. It explains why new BMWs are controversial with the design, especially the big ugly grill which wasn't winning any beauty awards when the first press pics came out, yet BMWs are selling cars in crazy numbers. It could also explain why the interior design of BMWs in the last 20 years was an incremental change rather than a radical change like the exterior as most people get a glimpse of the outside of the car only. It is only in the last 2 years or so with the latest generation of BMWs where the interior design has changed with the big wide screens.
