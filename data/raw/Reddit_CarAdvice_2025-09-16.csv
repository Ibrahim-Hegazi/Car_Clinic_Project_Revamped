Usually just a few drops of brake fluid will drip ..not spurt..out. (after that, re-bleeding at that hex nut may be needed). However I think? the pedal would want to come back up regardless of possible fluid clog. Don't know if boosters tend to stick internally...did you replace with new?

So it sounds more like a mechanical problem. You haven't described or mentioned the rod that I think goes from brake pedal into the booster, could it be rubbing/sticking on something? After all it does go through the firewall...

Tangent probably but .. reminds me of the clutch pedal on my 73 firebird with nothing but rods and other metal linkage between pedal and clutch fork.

I had it replaced under warranty and all was well. I then had my starter replaced in May of 2025 if this holds any relevancy (fully died, had to be towed and replaced). Now it is September of 2025 and my car has been taking longer to crank/seeming like I‚Äôm having battery problems again (the same as I was having the two times previously). The issue I am having is trying to determine if it would make any sense that within a span of a year I would get so unlucky that my battery would die twice.

It seems to drive fine, I think it could be a little better when taking off / shifting gears but my last car really put me through it with the transmission so I might be over analyzing. 

I turned right into a parking lot and when I put it in park there was a slight rattling noise coming from the passenger side AC/dash area. The car also just seemed to be vibrating more than normal. It didn‚Äôt do that on startup. 

Now again I just got home from a short drive, and when I turned right into the driveway and parked it was just the vibration in the car again (no rattling from the dash) I could hear it in intervals, like it will rattle real quiet for like 3 seconds on, 3 seconds off, and so on. I tried it in neutral, same thing. I had a water bottle in the cup holder, and the water in it was moving a lot.

There are no lights on the dash. I looked at the paperwork and in 2018 when the car was at 100k miles, it says the customer reported an intermittent rattle/grinding heard on startup (at random). They changed the AC belt tensioner and spark plugs, and when the customer came right back for the same issue they did the VTC actuator and timing chain tensioner. It doesn‚Äôt show they went back for it again,

1nhwes6,Battery short?-2010 Camry,"Hey everyone hoping to get some advice on an issue I‚Äôve been encountering sporadically.

So in a previous post I had mentioned that my car died during my drive to work. I was able to coast into the nearest parking lot and it turned over and started just fine. 

Earlier today I was at the store and when I came back and tried to start my car, nothing happened. No lights, no crank no seatbelt ping. It did think when I unlocked it with my fob but nothing after that. Anyway, I opened up the hood and remembered this happened once before like last year and all I had to do then was jiggle the negative terminal connector and it came back to life. So I did that again and sure enough, the alarm went off and when I started it, it was back to normal. 

Obviously this isn‚Äôt normal behavior so I‚Äôm wondering where to start troubleshooting here. I replaced the alternator last year and the battery as well but I did have to get it recharged twice before I was able to get the alternator in. Could I just be in need of a new battery or new terminal connectors? Or is there something else I should check as well?

1nhthyz,2022/2023 Nissan Frontier PRO4X with a rear crankshaft seal leak.,"Yesterday I took my Frontier to the official dealership for its 50,000 km service. They noticed an oil leak in the rear crankshaft seal (photos below).

Has anyone had this problem? Should I be worried? Is this a ""stop using my car immediately and get it fixed ASAP"" situation or a ""I'll check the oil level daily and drive it as long as I can"" situation?

I had already noticed a small amount of oil on the garage floor where I park, but nothing major. The leak is ""light"" (in the sense that the oil isn't gushing out, and I've been driving like this for a while, cause i was waiting for the 50.000km service).

I don't feel any symptoms while driving. However, I'm afraid of causing more significant damage, which could increase my expenses.

The dealership said the job is complicated because they'd have to remove the transmission. The service would take a week. They are charging me R$ 1,600 (US$ 294)for the crankshaft oil seal and an additional R$ 3,200 (US$ 589) for the mechanical service. 

The dealership also said the leaking fluid is transmission fluid, while a third-party mechanic told me it's actually engine oil that is leaking and that the rear crankshaft seal needs to be replaced, and yes, the job would be the same, remove the transmission and change the crankshaft seal. They gave me a total quote that's about 30% lower than the dealership's. Now I'm in doubt.

It's worth noting that the dealership will provide a 1-year or 20,000 km warranty on the service, while the other shop will only offer 3 months (which is the mandatory warranty period by law in my country).

Later this week, I'll take my car to another third-party shop to get a third diagnosis and quote.

This car is already out of warranty.

Car is primarily used for full time Uber and has a lot of mileage. 

Usually I get my oil change and all maintenance done at the Nissan dealer. Last time, they were too busy so I did my oil change at an xpress lube shop. That was Aug 11th. 

A few days later I noticed an oil leak and that my oil pan seemed loose/dangling. I went back to them. They had my car for 20-25 and came back saying a bolt had broken but they fixed it. 

Well now I went in for my maintenance and Nissan told me that ""the threads from the lower oil pan were pulled out with drain plug leaving hole in lower drain pan and that threads and drain plug were glued back in"" and that they recommend replacing the assembly, which is a $400 fix. 

I went back to xpress lube and they told me it's not glue but a sealant/marker they put on all cars to show the work was done and not tampered with. They pulled out the drain plug and showed it to me and said it's not broken. 

Of course Nissan says it will cause problems and needs to be fixed. 

So basically one is placing blame on the other, and I'm out $400 because I don't know enough about cars to call someone out on trying to scam me.

Waitits2015 (Score: 1): If the oil pan was actually loose/dangling, the car wouldn't have made it a mile down the road. Odds are you saw a splash guard or something hanging. 

The '23 Rogue uses a plastic oil pan with a threaded metal insert molded into it that the plug screws into. Incredibly common problem to have that insert come loose from the plastic pan and spin out with the drain plug. Most times due to the tech applying too much torque.

Very likely that the quick lube place is at fault, but instead of them fixing it properly and replacing the pan, the likely just glued the insert back into place - which is at best a temporary fix. The spiel about the marker being standard is nonsense. 

It should be on them to fix. If you raise a big enough fuss with management and bring documented proof that all previous oil changes were done at the dealer you might have a shot, but I wouldn't hold my breath. Up to you to decide if it's worth your time or just eat the charge and chalk it up as another lesson to not use quick lube shops."

Anyway, needless to say, coincidences are way more common than you think, and every shop has their nightmare vehicles that break due to unrelated circumstances when they get sent home.

If it somehow was the shops fault (and I really don't see HOW it could be .. When you replace pads and rotors, you do not touch the ABS, that is a sensor on the hub, which does not come off, or even get disconnected) the dealership should find it.  But don't count on it.  I smell coincidence.

I wondered what was taking so long and without my permission the mechanic was doing a compression test, which to my knowledge is not standard for a ppi. 6 hours later the car was misfiring in cylinder 6. 

Long story short that mechanic sat on the car for 3.5 months while i messaged and called nearly every day trying to get updates on him trying to fix the car. I finally got fed up and brought it to another shop to get fixed on my own dime but they want to go through all the same steps he did(which I understand they need to confirm things for themselves) but whatever is causing these misfires seems to be some kind of mystery and I'm just trying to sell this thing while I'm racking up thousands in repair bills. 

I'm wondering if anyone has dealt with this kind of thing before? I'm wondering what my options are other than continue to let shops troubleshoot and get a bill for $2k every couple of days while they haven't found the fix. It seems like these bills could go forever and would defeat the purpose of trying to recoup some of what i paid for the car. 

Do I have any recourse against the original shop? I've got tons of evidence through text that the mechanic acknowledged the car was driving great when i first dropped it off.

Fords in general are just an example of doing headlights wrong and have been basically forever. No Ford has ever had good headlights.

Edit:

I'll expand on this with a little story. Because Colorado and Freightliner suck I once hit a ladder on the freeway and lost my brakes.

Colorado is an outlier in headlight height laws, while most states are a 54"" max, Colorado is 44"". So Freightliner being the cucks they are mount their headlights rather low. When sitting in a semi your eyes are IDK 10' off the ground, when the lights are less than 4' any rise in the road creates a shadow where the road ahead isn't illuminated by the headlights. So unless it's day or there's streetlights the driver can't see the road surface.

This is exactly what happened, at night on a mountain pass, just over the crest of a hill there was a ladder laying in the road. By the time my headlights illuminated it there was nothing I could do. I hit it and it ripped a bunch of the air lines under the truck. In a rig with air brakes this is a BIG problem.

If the headlights had been mounted higher there wouldn't have been that shadow, I'd have seen the ladder in time and I wouldn't have found myself on a mountain pass at night with no brakes.

1nh8m77,So many mixed statements about adding PAG oil,"I have a 2007 Saturn Ion-2 2.2 that calls for 5 ounces of PAG oil. I replaced the compressor, condenser, part of the line that has the low side service port on it, and the expansion valve. I flushed the whole system, including the evaporator with solvent. My issue is that the new compressor says ""prefilled 160+20. I'm assuming that's ml. If so, that's a little over the full amount required. But when I attempted to pour out what's in the compressor to measure and make sure less than an ounce came out. Is oil usually trapped inside new compressors? I spun the clutch, but not much more came out.

Also, if I replaced all those parts and emptied the new compressor, can I just add the full amount to the new compressor? Or should some be added to the evaporator? My condenser has the drier/accumulator affixed to it. It's all one part. Should I pour oil into the condenser?

The battery stores enough power to keep the computers going, fuel pump, injectors, spark plugs, sensors, etc for a little while.  How long depends entirely on how much electric power the car needs and how much the battery stores - could die in 2 minutes or it could drive for an hour and there's really no telling without more info on current draw and battery capacity and condition.  You would at least want to minimize electrical load as much as you can by keeping the blower and radio off, driving during daylight and not using any lights, drive gently, and take the most direct route that takes the least time.  Using a battery charger to top off the battery before going would give you the best chance of making it.

But, there are a lot of variable you would want to be sure of before trying to drive it anywhere.  Screeching noises are usually from the serpentine belt slipping over a pulley because the pulley doesn't want to turn.  It is very possible it is shredding the belt, or the alternator could actually be fine and it is something else like an idler pulley or tensioner not wanting to turn making it hard for the belt to turn the alternator.  If the belt fails completely or can't turn well, it could take out other systems like power steering or the water pump (if it is belt driven, some are on the timing belt instead or even electric).  Losing the belt entirely could cause the engine to overheat if it also stops the water pump from turning.  I would want to figure out for certain what isn't wanting to turn before driving it because you could cause a lot more damage on the way.

I'm following the AllData procedure and it says to torque down the 8 bolts that surround the intake ports to 18 lb ft, then a 9th smaller bolt at the front of the intake to the same torque spec.

The bolt snaps and heart sinks, especially because it's not my car. I assumed the torque wrench failed as I did not feel a click, so I threw it in the garbage.

Of course the bolt I needed wasn't in stock at any dealer or parts store, nor was I in the proper mindset to attempt a bolt extraction, so I put everything back together temporarily.

After ordering the bolt this morning, I decided to look at procedure on Auto Repair Source and sure enough, it says to torque that 9th bolt to only 7 lb ft, which makes a lot more sense as it is a smaller bolt.

The trailer used by a non-profit I'm involved with for moving mulch etc has some serious suspension issues. Funds are limited, and while I've rebuilt 4 cylinder engines before, I've never had to work on leaf suspension, so some basic questions.

On the other side, the locknut is missing from the shackle/hanger bolt, meaning the shackle could come loose if the trailer is driven again.

Question - is there meant to be a bush on the shackle/hanger bolt or not?

What I know so far:
	‚Ä¢	The ECU sends back ASCII-encoded hex split across multiple packets, terminated by 0D3E.
	‚Ä¢	The payload is tagged with 612F125, and the SOC value should be located in the bytes following that tag.
	‚Ä¢	For this exact string, the correct SOC is 68%.
	‚Ä¢	My current parsing attempts sometimes return garbage (e.g., 2097%, 0.3%), or nothing at all.
	‚Ä¢	Capacity and mileage decode fine using scaling factors, but SOC decoding seems inconsistent.

Apart from that, it would be basic fault finding, looking for anything burnt or corroded, and then there's the programming side.  
You'd likely end up needing to clone modules, virginise them etc, so you might need some automotive spec programmers that can read microcontrollers.  
UPA-USB, Xprog, VVDI, Hexprog etc.

Automotive stuff is usually decently made, so often problems are known common issues.  
For burned or water damaged stuff, that's probably going to be a case of cloning. It's not always needed, but some modules are locked to VINs, or a body module might be linked to keys, so you can often pull the data from a bad module, load into a used spare and that'll sort it.

1nhxfqv,Have been recommended to use 10w-30 instead of 5w-20 going forward,"
Much context provided, the title question starts further down in the middle.

For context on the motor. This is the 2AR FE motor from a 2007 Toyota Rav 4

I have receipt and proof of an engine swap actually. However it was the original 2AR FE then swapped for a less used 2AR FE

This motor replacement was done in 2023. I purchased the vehicle in the end of 2024 (November with Odometer now currently at about 170,000) (this puts this motor at about 125-135,000 give or take according to the reciept I have)

Bought from an older friend who‚Äôs a long time mechanic, specifically his friend who took really good care of his wife‚Äôs car. 

I have receipts for all the work done so when I got the car it had a new water pump, new timing belt, new radiator, and of course the replacement 2AR FE

(It now occurs to me that I should call the guy I bought it from as well as the shop that did the replacement)

He said the guy who did the motor swap throughly inspected and rejected other motors until he was satisfied with putting in a replacement

The key thing here is at the time of purchase, I didn‚Äôt know about this motor recall and faulty piston ring assembly.

I definitely am not leaking oil and am definitely burning oil.

Hence why I should call the two parties and see if they were aware of the piston ring issue.

My buddy who made the connection for us logically reminded me ‚Äúwell this motor probably did get the recall work done, that‚Äôs why they did the motor replacement‚Äù

Regardless of how confident I am in those parties knowledge of faulty piston ring assembly, I‚Äôm definitely burning oil 

More importantly, they came from Tennessee and I purchased the vehicle in Florida where I reside and obviously temperature is quite high here year round.

The oil is usually burnt and black when I change it (I‚Äôve changed it twice now.) (First oil change done by Take 5 and then I said fuck it I‚Äôm doing all this shit myself from now on)

After Take 5 oil change I started using Toyota packaged 5w-20. Which according to the manual is good for my external temperatures.

Did the first oil change at 3,000 mile interval since Take 5 just to see for myself what the oil looks like and be more proactive not reactive.

I ended up changing the oil (not the filter) after another 1,800 miles as I drove the car to (ironically) Nashville for a trip earlier this year.

Made it to Nashville which was a nice smooth ride about 757 miles, topped off the burnt oil. Drove home 757 miles again, went back to daily life for a little while and decided I wanted to change the oil as I explained proactively after a long back and forth, wanting to visually confirm the health of my oil and it‚Äôs burning 

That all being said, feel free to tell me if it‚Äôs not actually smart to change the oil less than 5,000 intervals. I don‚Äôt see the harm as I know I burn oil, it has continued to come out black. Less black since I‚Äôm doing it preemptively. Still burnt 

Back to the title quesiton:

My buddy damn near called me crazy for running 5w-20 in a motor over 100,000 miles in Florida heat. He confidently urged me to go up to 10w-30 year round so long as I‚Äôm keeping the vehicle in Florida‚Äôs heat.

We are going into hurricane/winter and rarely do we see temperatures of 39 degrees on a crazy cold front. The colder averages here are more so 47-57 degrees outside (Fahrenheit obviously)

Despite our rare winter temperatures, my buddy still says I should be good running 10w-30 year round in Florida and that I should even see the burning issue significantly less or stop all together.

I wasn‚Äôt exactly following his reasoning and I‚Äôm not a complete dumbass so I just wanted to get some more experienced opinions on his advice.

Should I go for the 10w-30 going forward with this high mileage 2007.

After confirming if the motor got the piston ring assembly fixed, is that advice still good or should I stick to the manufacturer specifications?",1,1757968693.0,5,AskMechanics,1758051238,2025-09-15 20:38:13,2025-09-16 19:33:58,"redline83 (Score: 2): There's not much reason to use 10W-30 anymore in 2025.

If you want more protection than a 5W-20 offers then you can move to a quality 5W-30 or 5W-40. I would just run like M1 ESP 5W-30 with 3.5 HTHS, very stout.

1nhw13d,Is my mechanic trying to rip me off? // Fusion Hybrid 2018,"Hello,

  
So about 2 months ago my Fusion 2018 started with funny noises coming, like a *clack clack,* turns out that both of my CV axles were bad and also the supports from trans and engine, we've been taking our cars to the same shop for about 12-14 years, never had an issue with them but recently they started to raise their prices a lot, they quoted me for this job around 1700 USD (30k mexican pesos, I live in Tijuana) which seemed to me wayyyy too expensive so i told them that if i can bring the axles from a 3rd party and they agreed.

Ordered the parts (CV axles and engine supports) from a ""trusted"" ebay seller, it was around 300 usd in total, all parts came nicely packaged as usual and took it to the shop, they did the job and the car was fine for about 2 weeks and then it started to do the same exact noise, took it back and now they're saying that all the parts that i replaced are damaged. like both axles and engine/trans support, so my question here is:

Are they trying to rip me off on this case? It seems so strange to me that ALL 3 PARTS are damaged, if just one had issues i get it, they're cheap parts and they probably not meant to last as long as OEM but holy moly, just 2-3 weeks of use seems weird to me, specially when they quoted me the job almost 3x the price i paid

If it fires up immediately, then yes, it‚Äôs probably a bad fuel pump- specifically, the check valves inside the fuel pump that keeps the fuel from draining back out into the fuel tank.

The easiest way I can explain it is this- when you shut off your engine, there is still fuel completely filling the fuel line between the tank and the engine. When you go to restart your engine, because that fuel is already there, it is able to start up quickly. 

The fuel is kept in the fuel line by a one-way valve that allows fuel to be pushed past it by the fuel pump, but won‚Äôt allow the fuel to come back the other direction and drain into the tank.

When this valve fails because it gets stuck due to dirt or corrosion, the fuel line can drain out into the fuel tank, so every time you try to start the engine, the fuel pump has to refill the entire fuel line."

1nhpk4n,"Changed rear differential oil, three hours later the axle is destroyed","Last week my wife was out of town and took our 2016 Ram 1500 (160 000 km/ 100 000 miles) in for an engine oil change.  The place recommended a rear differential oil change at the same time, which she agreed to.  
She started on her way home, and less than 300km (180 miles) later the truck started to knock/ vibrate.  She stopped and pulled into another oil change shop (it was a Saturday and most full garages were closed).  They took the above video and advised the vehicle shouldn't be driven.  
We've since had it towed to a full shop, and received a quote of \~ $5000 (CAD) for a used rear axle, and possible brake lines.  
So my question is: is this just a coincidence that this happened almost immediately after the oil change?  And if not a coincidence, what could they have possibly done wrong that would have caused this to fail completely? My only thought is if they forgot to put any oil in, or didn't replace the drain plug,  but you can see in the video, it does look like oil was present.  My wife said there was quite a bit sprayed up on the underside of the vehicle.

After letting it dry out a few days it started right up but since then, I've been having trouble getting it shifted into first gear.

I'm curious what I ought to do next? I assume I need to drain the transmission but not sure if I should spray any alcohol inside or some product inside to clean out the water? How do I go about fixing this transition piece which seems to be loose? Fwiw the reservoir levels are fine and I have not driven it or gotten into gear since the whole pond fiasco.

1. the engine shaking can mean a few things, it can mean it has 1 or multiple failing cylinders (which mostly is a failing spark plug, coil, or fuel injector) but can also mean oil or coolant is entering the combustion chamber due to a broken headgasket or cracked cylinder. It could also mean the motor-mounts are bad, although the constant shaking point me in the direction of a malfunctioning cylinder.
2. The smoking seems to come from the oil cap, which can indicate there is too much pressure in the crankcase? (don't know if the terminology is correct, i am used to Dutch Automotive terminology.) This can mean all sorts of things, being as simple as a malfunctioning crankcase ventilation (PCV) or as bad as a a torn (head) gasket or cracked cylinder wall which both (can) allow exhaust gasses to enter the crank-case or oil channels.

These are all wild guesses, and some of my mentioned problems should show more symptoms then just the 2 mentioned, and i will probably be corrected by someone with more non-amateur knowledge.

**TL,DR;** The 2 symptoms could be related, but can also be 2 (or more) entirely different problems. It can be a fix of a few dollars, or it can mean you need a new engine.

What can happen is that they can wear down over time and get stuck where they're not supposed to be. This would explain why your car doesn't start moving until you give it more gas and build up pressure.

Unfortunately, this issue cannot be fixed without removal of the trans pan and the valve body. I would take it to a GM dealership or a well-known transmission shop."

But seriously, nobody can accurately answer without knowing what are the prevailing wages in your area and for what vehicle.  First get the breakdown between parts and labor.

I think it seems fine, especially for premium parts and new rotors. Is this both axles and including new brake fluid flush? Then it's a steal.

If you know the exact parts you can go on like rockauto and at least get the parts cost, then you know what the labor would be.

1991 Toyota Cressida 3L
125,000 miles
(For those unfamiliar, it‚Äôs a straight six rear wheel drive, sought after by certain folk). 

Very well maintained, very good condition, head turner for those who know. 

New head gasket solved an insidious problem and car ran better than ever. 

New problem came up, took it to the same shop that replaced the gasket. 

Problem is an oil ‚Äòleak‚Äô. The head gasket installation is good. It‚Äôs not a leak actually; after putting dye in the oil, ‚Äòleak‚Äô was traced to the distributor, so oil is being ejected at a fairly good clip. 

That mechanic said the distributor should be replaced. 

But first, I bought a new O ring from Toyota, had it installed, no effect on problem. 

Different city now, car going into well regarded shop. Preliminarily discussion: it‚Äôs possible the new O ring is incorrect part. That could be true in my experience with that Toyota dealer. At the same time as the O ring purchase they sold me replacement wiper rubber; one fit, the other was for a completely different car, so I know they make mistakes, or their part ID system contains errors especially considering the age of the car. 

Maybe the O ring IS incorrect.

Ive seen places like moris offer 1st party cover, but that's poi tress if ypure not covered for 3rd party in the first place.
By law, uk insurers must cover you on eu roads at minimum 3rd party, which would include the ring on tourist days, but im aware that the financial ombudsman have stated that they deem the nurburgring on tourist days to be a prepared track, therefore I see many, if not all, insurers include clauses to not cover the ring.
My questions are,
1. Are there any uk insurers that do cover it?
2. In the event of a crash, would a policy get cancelled or voided? I understand that cancellations and voided policies must be declared for life, but if there's a way to cancel beforehand, that would be nice. Or would they just go after the costs afterwards without voiding?

Id really love to go to the nurburgring on a road trip, however i couldn't afford to declare a cancelled policy, let alone paying for a crash myself.

We avoid the mad full open touristfahten days, do evening sessions out of seasons and I've had countless laps of the place with the track to myself throughout a run.

Well good luck I guess. It's part of the risk of motorsport. It's not something I think about whilst lapping.

My current insurer doesn't actually name an exclusion on the Nurburgring nordschilef. But it's not something I ever want to test first hand.

1nhvupj,Garage can't fix my car,"So, I'm in a bit of a pickle...

Nissan Micra 2013 

My car has been having problems for just over a week. 

It started 2 weekends ago, I parked my car for an appointment and I came back and I had trouble starting (a very slow crank). I thought this was just because I left my indicator stalk down, not usually a problem nor something I normally do. 

I went to work last Monday and car started fine, but I had no stop/start light on my dash. I thought it was just a low battery, took it to my mechanic friend who confirmed it was very low and just needed a good drive.

Next morning I'm driving to work, stop/start light is flashing. 2 minutes into my drive my car cuts out. No dash lights, no steering. I could start it but it would just stall out again, managed to bunny hop to the side of the road out of the way.

Called the AA, said the battery was low but alternator tested at 12.15v. Took it to the nearest garage to look at the alternator.

That garage said nothing for 2 days. Phoned Thursday and they said the alternator is fine but they're looking into it as there is a problem.  

Phoned again today, and again alternator is testing fine. It can drive short distances but does cut out, but can be restarted in a few minutes. They said they think its an electrical issue, possibly the immobiliser but they aren't sure. It would need an auto electrician to look at it, but as it stands currently they can't fix it.

Mechanic friend swears blind its just an alternator, but they haven't looked at it. 

So now I have to pick my car up tomorrow to bring it home, I'm a bit nervous but hopefully its fine.

Now I'm just unsure of next steps, and being told different things is confusing. I don't want to replace my alternator if there is some bigger issue at hand. But wouldn't the garage be able to diagnose that rather than just claim my car is unfixable?

Is my car unfixable? I can't drive it far to somewhere to have a look so I'm a bit stuck",0,1757965205.0,31,CartalkUK,1758051238,2025-09-15 19:40:05,2025-09-16 19:33:58,"verone3784 (Score: 7): If the alternator is showing 12.15v when the car is running, then it's not fine.

In order to charge your battery, the alternator should be above 13.5v minimum. A super healthy new one will be closer to 14.5v. You've more than likely got a dead or dying alternator that's struggling to charge your battery.

Check your battery voltage too, a resting car battery should be somewhere between 12.5-13V. With the engine running, the potential difference across the terminals should be somewhere around 13.5-15V depending on your alternator's power delivery.

Some_Car_Nutter (Score: 2): Some alternators don't put out a full 14.--volts immediately. Some wait a few minutes to do that, i vaugely remember something about car manufacturers not wanting to load the engine down with full alternator demand immediately after engine starting. That could be why different people are giving you different voltage reports, they are testing it when its in different modes.

Or the alternator is actually on its way out. 

Or the alternator is fine and its actually the plug getting warm and the connection expanding causing intermittent connection symptoms.

Something to keep in mind, modern cars often have the alternator voltage regulation done separately to the actual alternator its self. 
The problem could actually be the ecu/module that does the voltage regulation rather than the alternator its' self.

Or the wiring for the alternator is shot and is rubbing through the insulation and shorting out intermittently.

Or its not the alternator at all and they are all chasing a red herring...




Different ideas:

Crank / Cam sensor dieing, they are known to go bad intermittently and conk the engine out. Car sits, cools down, sensor starts working again, then the engine starts. That is something to consider. Did they mention what components they tested? I assume they tested all the main sensors and didn't just focus purely on the alt.

Another item that is heat-related: Ignition coil/Coil pack (assuming its a petrol?) Those are known to display similar symptoms when failing triggered by the natural heat of the engine. Warm engine - dieing coil pack - car conks out, Car cools down, coil pack works again.

Intermittent issues are the absolute worst for diagnosing because you can only reliably test the components when the car is in the process of actually being broken. As soon as the car starts working again the component that is causing the fault would test as a working item, until the (presumably) heat takes its toll and the component in question craps the bed again....

Heres the even worse news: An automotive electrician could test 30 different components, their time is worth money and they would then after however many hours of testing all these items still not locate the root cause of the fault and they would have to either eat the cost of their time or ask you for money for a problem that hasn't even been fixed.

Lets assume they find the intermittent fault after hours and hours and hours of searching, how much do they charge you? A Few quid? Hundreds? I dunno. I'm just a hobbyist so i dunno how the economics of that works.

Some potential ideas to think about in that block of text, either way.

There is some nuance if it's on-street parking vs a private car park but ultimately, if you cannot pay for parking and show proof of payment, you haven't fulfilled your side of the contract and cannot park there.

If there is specific language on the signeage saying 'if there is no ability to pay, parking is free', that's a different story, but that's quite rare.

Ultimately, if you haven't got paid parking in place, you must go somewhere else. 'It wasn't working' means you can't park there, rather than you can park for free.

You are always free to park elsewhere. It may be inconvenient, but that doesn't negate the contract in place for parking with permission of the landlowner.

I‚Äôm a little bit lost here. I‚Äôve been a driver for a long time but only now owning a car and it‚Äôs the first accident I was involved in. In the country where I come from there aren‚Äôt any big automotive groups like Kwik, Steer or Arnold Clark - everybody has got their own mechanic and sticks with them!

The pros of going with Steer is that they allegedly give lifetime warranty for repair and courtesy car (I don‚Äôt need it but it‚Äôs a nice perk). If anything happens, Admiral are supposed to handle it.

The independent shop I found gives one year warranty and I have to deal with it myself. I‚Äôm fine with that if they are more likely to do a good job (or so I think).

Any pros and cons of each? Maybe somebody can recommend a decent shop in London who could uptake this?

1nhkmcj,MX5 or Suzuki Swift as daily for ¬£10k,"At the moment I drive a Citroen C1. It's my first car and I absolutely adore it and will be very sad to see it go. I like the simplicity of it. The only downsides are how slow it is and how now, at almost 17 years old, it is starting to show its age. I'm thinking of buying a new(er) car after Christmas as a present to myself!

My favourite car is the MX5, of all generations, but I'd be looking at the NC or an early ND. Practicality wise, it's fine. I rarely have passengers at all and a small boot is something I'm quite used to! I know these are very reliable cars although for the NC I'm looking at the 2.0 engine as I've heard the 1.8 can consume a lot of oil (one of the problems my C1 has). The big issue is of course RUST as I know these cars are prone to it. I am a bit worried about spending 10k on a rust bucket, or the risk of the car becoming a rust bucket as it would be my daily. I'm having trouble convincing my family to let me have one of these cars as they say they're too fast (ha!) and cost too much for a 10+ year old car.

The other car I quite like is the Suzuki Swift. For 10k I could buy a slightly newer Swift than an MX5 and possibly the Sport. I like the looks of this car and it's not one I see around very often and I think it's just nice to have something a little bit different. I did look at Fiestas but I find them boring as they are so ubiquitous. Again, being Japanese I expect good reliability from a Swift. There's not really anything I don't like about the Swift, just it's not quite as interesting as an MX5, and I do think the infotainment screen looks a bit naff.

Really my heart says get an MX5 and my head says get a Swift. The Swift is the cheaper car to run in terms of tax and fuel and insurance is similar for both cars.",5,1757939733.0,30,CartalkUK,1758051238,2025-09-15 12:35:33,2025-09-16 19:33:58,"Tachanka-Mayne (Score: 5): May I offer the wildcard of Toyota MR2, they‚Äôre less rusty than MX-5s and with your budget you will be able to get one in concourse condition with money still left over.

When I took the car in for the service the mechanic was adamant that they are winter tyres and not all season, because the symbols on the tyre are for winter only. They show a ""mountain"" with a snow flake inside it, and M + S which means Mud + Snow. He says these are the winter tyre symbols, and that if they were actually all season there should be a sun symbol also, and that noone should really be using winter tyres in the south of England given the very few days it's actually needed (if at all) and the compromise of reduced grip in normal conditions.

Is he correct or is he mistaken on the symbols/claim that these are winter tyres? I've included the relevant part from a stock image for this model and I have the same. I noticed that underneath the model name (Vector) it says 4seasons. I would've thought no tyre fitter or manufacturer would mislead customers and there must be regulations around this kind of stuff so am inclined to think the mechanic is mistaken and presumably the symbols are just showing that it's rated for certain winter conditions, but just wanted to double check on the off chance he's right.

I spend my time split between the UK and Iceland (honestly, vastly more Iceland these days) - winter tyres are basically a requirement (although are not mandatory) here in the winter.

Despite being a petrolhead, I knew fuck all about any tyres other than summer rubber before I moved out here in 2012, but it's basically a requirement to know what you're looking at in terms of tyres over here in the winter, unless you want to end up in a ditch.

The confusion probably arises from the fact that there are two different symbols on the tyre that mean two different things, but are often mistaken for each other, and historically have been used in different ways so a lot of people talk shite about them that isn't true.

The first one is the Three-Peak Mountain Snowflake Symbol, also known as the Alpine symbol. All **winter** tyres have this, and historically it was used to identify tyres that meet specific snow traction requirements and have been designed for use in severe snow and ice conditions.

However, because **all season** tyre technology is so advanced now and many all season tyres meet these requirements, a lot of all season tyres also have the alpine symbol on them too now, which confuses people and causes them to make the same mistake as your mechanic has.

The second marking is M+S - Mountain and snow. Originally, tyres received this marking purely based on tread geometry. It was first used to differentiate tyres that had better water, slush and snow dispersal characteristics because of more 'knobbly' tread designs that used chevron like grooves to push water, snow and slush toward the edges of the tyre and out of the tread.

While tyres that have the Alpine symbol have to comply with ASTM F 1805 testing to make sure they comply with minimum industry standard for grip on snow and ice, there is **no standard** required before you can mark your tyres with M+S as a manufacturer. There is an EU directive that says something like 'a tire with a tread pattern that's designed for better performance in snow and ice than a normal tire', but outside that there's no industry standard that you need to meet to brand M+S.

To be fair, the main difference between an all season and a winter tyre can't actually be seen with your eyes - winter tyres are manufactured from a way softer compound that stays more flexible in colder temperatures to provide higher grip levels and to make sure the tread can deform and grip the surface of the road, or snow and ice more easily. This is why people swap away from winter tyres in the summer, because they wear hard in higher temperatures and are fucked after a few thousand miles.

Some manufacturers also offer studded versions of their winter tyres - see them a lot over here in Iceland and while they're great while you're out in the country, they're trying to ban them over here in the capital because they absolutely rip the shite out of the roads, and you really don't need them when driving in urban areas.

We have a full on winter tyre season over here from November 1st to April 15th where Samg√∂ngustofa (the Department of Motor Vehicles) recommends you swap to winter tyres. Between these dates is the only time you're allowed to run studded tyres on your car too, although sometimes they extend the window if the weather is particularly bad.

With all season tyres being so good these days though, most people end up just running a really good set of them rather than the ballache of changing them up - personally I use the Michelin CrossClimate 2 my cars.

Hope this helps :)"

1nhhikl,Potential of mini car scraping the road?,"Hello!

I don't know much about cars. I drive a 2005 Puegeot 107, it's 4 seat but if you carry slightly heavier passengers in the back (~100+ kg each)- the car tends to be inches away from the ground that slightly uneven road means it will be scraping the road- not even going to mention speed bumps.

I'm hoping to rent a Mini ""Toyota Aygo or similar"" as it's very similar to my own car. I've never rented or driven a different car before (other than my driving instructor's 2020ish Vauxhall Corsa).

My question is, I will have 3 passengers in the car, with 2 being on the heavier side (~150-180kg) that will be sitting in the back seats. Is the car touching the ground just an issue for my old car or is it a common issue for mini cars? Should I be looking into renting a slightly bigger car?
