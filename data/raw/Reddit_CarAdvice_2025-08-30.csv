1n3myi2,Strange Noise After Shutting Off Engine,"üëã Hello everyone,

After I turn off the engine, this strange creaking/scratching noise comes from around the water pump area. The water pump was changed today because of an early diagnosed coolant leak. 

When i turn the engine on and while driving around there are no issues, no sound, no warning lights, no overheating problem and the car sounds normal. The noise only comes after i shut the engine off. I couldn't find the reason on the internet and forums etc.

Tomorrow I need to drive about 250km/155mile and I'm wondering if it's safe to make the trip or if I should get it checked before? Your help would be really appreciated!

1n3mh19,"Help me diagnose my car issues, I'm frustrated want to fix this car.","2007 nissan tiida 6 speed manual engine is MR18DE.


So I've been trying to do some mechanical work myself over the past few years being on a budget as solo income with 3 kids and a Mrs it just made sense to do minor mechanical repairs myself. Never had anyone in my life to teach me these things but I jumped into it and over the years have done things like oil filter changes, spark plugs, coil paks, replacing drive shafts when when the boots failed on the CV joint, ball joints, control arms changes and did all this on my old xtrail and everything went fine and ran that car to over 450,000kms before selling it due to moving.

So when I jumped in the Mrs car the last week and heard what sounded like a wheel bearing i decided I'd try find out which one and replace it. Did a few sharp turns and decided I'd take a punt on the front right wheel bearing. 

I decided I'd do the front disc brake pads while I was at it.

I bought a bearing a new bearing hub assembly and replaced it, did the brakes and figured It'd be all sweet.

I used a torque wrench for the mounting bolts and axle nut,  put a little molybdenum on the axle, antiseize in the appropriate places. I bled the brakes, put new brake graphite grease on the sliding pins of the caliper, again used a torque wrench for the brakes. This was on the front right hand wheel. I bled the brakes, topped up the brake fluid, torqued down the wheel nuts. I even cleaned the ABS sensor while I was in there. New cotter pin, really went to the effort to do everything right.

 I got the wheel off I noticed oil all down the back of the engine and I even ended up doing a valve cover gasket aswell which was a whole issue in and of itself because it was brittle as fine china and was stuck to the head, so that was 4 hours with a torch, credit card tweezers and vacuum to get all that off without leaving anything in the gallery, that all went fine i guess, car is running smooth and no longer leaking oil. New oil and filter. I cleaned the throttle body while had it off to get into the valve cover. Did a good job I think for a first time gasket. Torque wrench didn't go low enough for the valve cover bolts but think I nipped them up appropriately, didn't go nuts on them. Did the front left side brakes since I did the right.


I was finally done, turned the car on, and it threw a fault, which was a throttle feedback fault, I realised I left off the plug that plugged into the throttle body. Plugged it back in, cleared the faults and all good engine sounds good and is running fine.

I was proud, but after a test drive the brakes seemingly worked fine and the wheel bearing noise was gone. I got home and went to double check the wheel and axle nuts after a 50km drive and the right wheel was hot, left one after brake job is fine. 

Bugger, I took off the wheel, fully wire brushed the brakes used cleaner and paid attention to the little clips the pads slot into, even put a dab of graphic grease on the tabs the brake pads sit and slide on.

Double checked the torque specs on the axle nut as that being to tight was an obvious issue that could cause the heat with this new bearing hub.

Went for a drive, came home and the wheel is still getting hot.

Its also making a strange clunk noise when I start the car, just as it starts. It's runs smooth and revs up just fine once started so I also need to figure out what that is. 

Help me, what should I check, what can I do? I'm really determined to get this right but this noise on startup and hot wheel I can't fix is frustrating.

I'd be great if someone with experience could guide me and give me some things to check. We could talk on whatsapp I could send videos of things I'm doing and looking at and sounds. 

I really want to get this car sorted I don't want my Mrs driving around in a car with my kids while the wheel is getting hot and making clunk on start up.

Repeat every weekend for 2-3 weeks.  Drive like a dozen miles or so, all gears, to mix it well.  Feel free to do the math to see how much old vs new fluid is in there each time.  

Learn how to check the level properly and adjust each time.  I can‚Äôt recall but I figured out how much each drain & fill takes to get full.  You can‚Äôt simply replace what you took out since it might have been high or low before.

Plenty of YouTube vids on how to do it properly and easily 

(I‚Äôve the same car.  It‚Äôs not hard.  )

If you want to get fancy, drop the pan and replace the filter.  Decide that based upon how nasty it was / is.  Some are clean at 100, 200, or 300k miles, some way dark.

New fluid is most critical, not the filter.

  why. nothing electronic or electrical works properly if its not correctly connected..

 Lesson one. Voltage drop..

 visualize a garden hose.. no nozzle. valve on the wall wide open, the water flowing full speed thru the hose. 

  but the water is rubbing the inside of the hose.. slowing it down slightly.. this is known as pressure drop. 

 if you kinked the hose.. you have the same pressure pushing into the hose.. but less coming out because the kink is slowing it down and dropping the pressure coming out.. again Pressure drop..

 Pressure is like voltage..  

 flow is like amperage.. 

 copper is not a perfect conductor.. electrons travel Mostly on the surface of the wire strands.. some go thru the inside.. corrosion can slow down electrons flowing thru the wire.. 

 if you measured the difference in pressure at the ends of the garden hose with it flowing freely. you would see a tiny pressure drop, if you measured the same hose with a kink.. you would see more pressure drop .. 

 loose electrical connections.. loose crimps.. corrosion.. causes voltage drops.. only a very small voltage drop is allowable.. 

 that test takes less than 5 minutes. its something i do on every car and truck.  this is not the last area to perform it on.. but it must be the first. 

 as for rebuilding an engine.. turbo charging or supercharging. that requires a Lot of Engine knowledge..

I just took my car to the dealership because there was a obvious coolant leak somewhere. The dealer said the ‚Äúcoolant crossover pipe and the y-pipe needed replacement‚Äù. They were charging a high price so I decided I would take it to an independent shop and do it for less. When I went to pick up the vehicle from the dealership, I tried refilling the coolant but everything was just pouring out, emptying the entire tank in just a few seconds. This was definitely not how it was before (I have a video of before), a slow leak that dropped mildly over a long period of time. When I asked the service advisor how this happened, they admitted that during the pressure test they ran it higher than what the car would pressurize to. Is this normal, or do you think the high pressure caused the part to fully break off leading to this?

1n3fppi,2023 Ram 1500 Advice,"Hey everyone I need some advice as to what may be happening to my 2023 Ram 1500 5.7 etorque RWD.

I bought the truck with 30,000 miles on it. After about a week of ownership I felt a clunking in the steering wheel / column. Took it to my local dealer, as it is still under B2B until 36,000 miles. They discovered play in the steering gear box and replaced the steering rack. 

Picked up the truck and within 10 miles I began to hear the clunking again. The truck was also pulling to the right and steering wheel was off center.

Brought it back a few days later and after they looked at it they said that they need another steering rack. They believe they were sent a bad one.

They put another steering rack in and everything felt fine for a few days, then the noise came back very subtly. I decided to bring it to another Ram dealership in my area to get a second opinion. I told them the whole story of how many racks have been put in and I suspect something else may be causing them to go bad.

After inspection they verified it needed another new steering rack but everything underneath the truck was normal and they don‚Äôt believe anything is causing the rack to go bad.

Is it possible to get 2 bad steering racks back to back? Why would it work fine for a little bit then start the same problem?

RECOMMENDATIONS/ADVICE:  What have you experienced around this issue?   Frequency of occurrence?  What can I do or specifically ask for?

Drove up a mountain area in southern AZ. About 30 miles up 1000‚Äô to 9000‚Äô elevation. When we got up and out smelt a strong burning smell(plastic/rubber) We sat between 2000-3500 RPM all the way up. 

When we got down off the mountain the smell went away I just checked and engine coolant is sitting at the low level. I also have cvt fluid changed at last oil change. I‚Äôm cleaning out the throttlebody as soon as I get a new gasket for it this weekend and I‚Äôm going to top off the coolant. There‚Äôs no visible leaks anywhere under the car or on the transmission. Anything else I should check or should I take it somewhere to do a full look over or just wait to see if it happens again?

I‚Äôve been trying to fix an issue with the engine response and power, in which it‚Äôs sluggish to rev up (as seen in the video), and doesn‚Äôt seem to perform to factory spec (I made a post about that particular issue recently, and the video attached to that one shows how slow it currently is, about 10-11s 0-100 when it should be in the 7s). 

I‚Äôve been chasing this for a while, and I recently replaced the fuel pressure regulator on the intake manifold, because it would also sort of bog down at high RPM, where it would just progress really slowly through the revs, and then all of a sudden jump back to life at 6,000 ish. I figured the FPR would fix that and the other issues, given all the other stuff I‚Äôve already replaced (list below). 

Anyway, I went out to test it, and it didn‚Äôt really seem any faster, but I wasn‚Äôt really sure. Either way, when I got home, I plugged in my OBD2 scan tool to try and have a look at some live data. Who knows, maybe the intake air temp sensor was dead or something. 

Well, turns out I forgot to clear a P0325 knock sensor code from last year, caused by borked phasing on an injector and a poor MAP sensor (according to a mechanic friend). This code didn‚Äôt make the check engine light show for some reason, I‚Äôm guessing it was just a residual code or something. 

After clearing it, I restarted the engine (it was still fully warm), and the throttle responded incredibly well. One tap, where I would quickly go all the way to full and then off, revved it up to about 2,500, and then further taps made it rise super quickly. I didn‚Äôt need to hold the throttle down, as I do in the attached video. So, I went for a drive, and it still didn‚Äôt seem to be much faster, but not only that, it went back to how it responds now after about ten minutes. 

I parked up and checked the fault codes, still nothing. I don‚Äôt know if the knock sensor is bad, or what, but if it‚Äôs anything to do with that, surely the code would have come back, right? Should I have reset the ECU (it has a self-learning system that dynamically adjusts the fuel and spark delivery and kind of builds a unique fuel map, I think that‚Äôs how it works anyway) before driving it? But if that‚Äôs the case, why would it respond so well initially, only to revert back after driving?

Now, for what I‚Äôve replaced:

Fuel injectors (start of the year)

MAP sensor (Mid-late last year)

Throttle position sensor (Last week)

Fuel pressure regulator (Couple days ago, as mentioned)

Fuel filter(three-four months ago)

Air filter (start of the year)

Cleaned out idle control valve stepper motor (Month and a half ago-ish, also sprayed some no-residue MAF sensor cleaner and 99.8% IPA on the connections)

One ignition coil (Month and a half ago-ish, I broke it when replacing a brake booster, since the old one had a vacuum leak), I feel like it would be a good idea to do the other three, but I wouldn‚Äôt think it would contribute to this, none of the symptoms have changed since that injector started playing up last year

Spark plugs (start of the year)

I think that‚Äôs everything

I‚Äôve got a 2015 Infiniti Q40, fully paid off, that I‚Äôve owned for about 6 years. It has 121k miles, runs great, and I‚Äôve only had to do regular maintenance. Zero issues otherwise. Honestly, it‚Äôs been bulletproof and super reliable.

1n2ymnd,Grinding/squeaking noise when braking - pads and rotors recently replaced,"2 weeks ago I took my car in for a vibration feeling (stronger when braking). They told me I needed new front brake pads and rotors. Had them replaced and they advised me that it would feel different. As soon as I started driving I tested the brakes and it felt like I needed to push much harder and almost having to pump the brakes for them to work. Brought it back in and the service advisor took it for a drive in the parking lot. He said nothing feels wrong and I just need to get used to it. Still felt slight pulsating when braking but not as much as before.

Fast forward to now - my cars been leaning left since the repair and I've felt discouraged to go back because of my experience with the service advisor. I am now starting to hear a grinding and squeaking noise when braking. I'm getting it towed back to the shop tomorrow as it doesn't feel entirely safe to drive.

Just looking for some input here. I originally thought that they possibly didn't bleed the lines. Now I'm not sure if its that or the calipers (or something else?)

First image is my driver's side where I'm feeling a pull when braking.
Second image is passenger side. 
Third image is fluid from when I moved the car up a bit to inspect further. (I have a slight engine leak but this seems to be closer to the curb so I'm assuming its possibly brake fluid?)

Hey everyone, I‚Äôm hoping someone here might have some insight because my mechanic and I are stumped.

Mechanic scanned it ‚Üí said front left ABS sensor was faulty.

I replaced it ‚Üí no change, ABS light still on.

About a week later, new problems showed up:

Check engine light came on

Speedometer stopped working

Fuel gauge started acting weird/hovering while driving

Steering feels stiff

Took it back to the mechanic:

This time scanner said front right ABS sensor ‚Üí replaced it ‚Üí no change.

Mechanic then replaced both front wheel bearings ‚Üí still no change.

The weirdest part:

Scanner readings keep changing.

Sometimes says right sensor, sometimes left, sometimes both.

Other times it points to the ABS module/actuator.

Seems like every couple hours it‚Äôs giving a different diagnosis.

At this point I‚Äôm confused (and broke üòÖ). The car still has all the same symptoms.

Old cars used to have a ""SUMMER/WINTER"" setting on the air intakes, where they would either pick up air from somewhere near the front or from the heatshield over the exhaust manifold.

Similarly, some aircraft have a ""CARB HEAT"" knob which does the same thing where air either comes from the intake at the front or from the exhaust heatshields. When you pull the knob you get a small but noticeable drop in RPM because you get a little less power.

HOWEVER!

Petrol is very cold when it evaporates, as you'll know if you've ever poured it in from a can and spilt some on your hand.

If you're driving in cold damp conditions, or even a hot but very humid day, the moisture in the atmosphere will freeze out on the jets in the carb and block them. This will cause a very sudden and rapid reduction in power, and by the time you've rolled to a stop on the side of the road, opened the bonnet, and got the top off the air intake, the heat from the engine will have melted the ice without a trace. It'll be fine for another few miles, and then it'll go again.

You will probably achieve gains of perhaps a couple of bhp at best.

If you want to make more power, throw that shitty obsolete carburetor out and fit fuel injection instead.

dacaur (Score: 2): Yes, cooler air is more dense, contains more oxygen, so will make more power and run more efficiently, increasing mpg. I've seen claims of 1-3mpg, up to 2-5mpg.

For power, supposed you get 1% more HP for every 7¬∞F temperature drop of intake air.

So if your vehicle is currently sucking air from the engine compartment at 120¬∞ (just a guess) and you add a cold air intake sucking in air from outside at 80¬∞F, that's potentially 5% more HP, so if you have 180hp, you could potentially see a bump of 9hp....

Of course all of this assumes your engine is currently sucking air from directly inside the engine compartment. All modern cars and even most carbureted cars you will find on the road today probably came with some sort of cold air intake from the factory."

If the trans fluid is pink and ""milky"" looking like a strawberry milkshake (after driving) then there is likely water contamination of the fluid. With the dipstick on a cold trans (hasn't been run) water should form distinct droplets separate from the trans fluid. 

The vibration could be a wheel balance issue (most noticeable at certain speeds) or a tire with a damaged/shifted belt. It would be good to check the adjustment of the wheel bearing as well to make sure there isn't excessive play. Hope this helps!

You need to have performed what is called a ""parasitic draw test"" on the car. Usually a multimeter set up for reading amps is placed between a disconnected battery negative cable and the negative battery post. Generally anything over 50 milliamps is considered excessive and will drain the battery over time. You can use process of elimination to pull fuses one at a time until the draw stops. The circuit that the fuse belongs to or some component of it will likely be the cause of the parasitic draw. Here is a more detailed write-up: [https://www.wikihow.com/Find-a-Parasitic-Battery-Drain](https://www.wikihow.com/Find-a-Parasitic-Battery-Drain)

I have also seen mechanics use a thermal imaging camera to detect a live circuit in wiring as current flow with a bit of resistance will produce heat that you can see on the thermal cam. Hope this helps!"

1n2zrz7,2012 Lexus ls460 problems,"*I'm going to go into detail about everything just in case there's some correlation between the problems that I'm having. Scroll down to the bottom for the **TLDR** if you need to. I put a picture of the connection that's damaged in the comments.*

I¬†bought a 2012 Lexus ls460 about a year & a ¬Ω ago and hadn't had a single problem with my car until I got my oil changed at Walmart about 4 months ago. I noticed about a week after I got the oil changed that it had a small oil leak. It progressively got worse and I asked a friend that is a mechanic what I needed to do & he told me to replace the oil filter housing cap. So I drove to Autozone got a aftermarket metal oil filter housing cap to replace the cracked plastic OEM one & was going to take it back to his shop the next day so he could put it on.
¬† ¬† ¬†The next day, I crank my car up & after it turned over, it immediately stalls out. When I went to crank it up again, it cranked right up, but you could hear that the engine was running roughly, the check engine light, & the trac off light came on. I tried to see if it would drive & make it up to the shop, but I was getting very little power from the engine when I pressed the gas & it wouldn't go faster than 15-20mph or come out of 1st gear. I checked the code and it was a P0101, so I took the MAF sensors out & tried to clean them with MAF sensor cleaner, but that didn't work so I ordered 2 new MAF sensors.¬†

While I was waiting on the MAF sensors to come in the mail, I had my car towed to my friend's shop so that he could install the new oil filter housing cap while I waited on the new MAF sensors. He was really busy, so it took him about 2-3 days to get to my car, but when he did, he couldn't move it to work on it, because the battery was dead. When he tried to charge it, the charger said it was a bad battery which is really strange, because I just bought this battery from Sam's Club about 9-10 months ago & it never gave me any problems except for their was a lose connection at the terminals at one point & my car died a few times, but I tightened the connection after I realized what it was & hadn't had a problem with the battery since. Anyways, I went to my local Lexus dealership & bought a battery from them & took it up to the shop. He installed it & installed the new oil filter housing cap & filled my car up with oil, but it was still running poorly & stalling with a P0100/P0101 code.¬†

I got the MAF sensors in the mail & took them up to the shop & replaced them. While we were replacing the MAF sensors, the connection that goes to the MAF sensor on the right side(driver side) was messed up & coming apart.(I'll attach a picture), but we carefully we were able to disconnect the old MAF sensor & replaced it with the new 1. Then we replaced the other MAF sensor. We cleared the code & the engine cranked right up and sounded great.

I drove home(about a 12mi/20min drive) and it drove perfectly. It was accelerating a lot better & the only thing that I noticed was that the speedometer seemed like it was saying that I was going about 5-10mph faster than I was. I may be wrong, but it just seemed like that at one point & my GPS app was saying I was going about 5mph less. Other than that, it drove very smoothly. I even stopped, turned off the car, & got gas and everything cranked right up with no problems. I get to my house & my gf needed to go to the grocery store about 4 hrs after I got back with the car & when she turned it on, the check engine light & trac off light came on. The engine was still running smoothly & I drove it around the block and noticed no issues. I checked the code & now it's giving me a P0171(Lean code on Bank 1) code.¬†

I'm trying to figure out if that code could be due to the MAF sensor connector being damaged. Or I noticed that it looks like air is seeping out of one of the hoses that connects to the air filter, but it's on completely & I zip tied it tighter just for good measure. I also read that someone was having similar problems due to a loose terminal connection with the battery that was giving the same codes & problems and I know that I had that issue before & it would explain the reason why my battery went bad so quickly. Or if it meant the MAF sensors that I just bought were faulty, but it's only giving the code for bank 1 so wouldn't it give the code for both if they were faulty MAF sensors?¬†

If anybody has experience with some of these same problems or might have some insights into what it is going on, that would be really helpful. Thanks.

**TLDR:** My car started having issues & gave a P0101 code so I ordered new MAF sensors. Then, a battery that I've had for less than a year died & when I tried to have it charged, the charger said it was a bad battery. I've only had problems with a lose connection to the terminal that I thought I fixed a while back, but I bought a new battery & replaced it, along with 2 new MAF sensors. It drove great at 1st, but a few hours later when I cranked the car, I got a check engine light with a P0171 code. One of the connections to the MAF sensor is damaged and I'm wondering if that could be the cause or if it could be the battery connection or something else. I've attached pictures to where the damaged connector.¬†",1,1756448244.0,1,CarHelp,1756582341,2025-08-29 06:17:24,2025-08-30 19:32:21,6h0st_901 (Score: 1): https://preview.redd.it/udh4ifsiiwlf1.jpeg?width=6120&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f79ad52544e1c719d9ddb13dc1b05be01d8654c4

1n3k2r7,Any ideas what this is?,"2014 Ford Taurus with 180K miles (she‚Äôs old!) 
Engine: NA 3.5L Duratec V6 Ti-VCT 

Sometimes under acceleration the car will go into limp mode, struggle to idle, and sound like it‚Äôs missing on several cylinders (easy to tell with my exhaust leak, which is getting fixed this week)‚Ä¶

I understand you can‚Äôt see the acceleration aspect in this video (since I don‚Äôt really like to use my phone while I drive) but if I were to describe it, it‚Äôs a normal acceleration and then at some point a long the way, all power is lost and the engine begins exhibiting the idling behavior in the video. 

Shutting the car off and restarting the engine seems to fix the problem - that is until the next time it happens. 

I do not believe this is a mechanical issue, since restarting the engine resumes normal operation - if I am wrong, please, enlighten me. I believe the issue is related to some sort of sensor, so I‚Äôve looked into some possible culprits, the usual have come up: 

-Throttle Body or TPS
-VCT Actuators 
-Cam Position Sensor 
-Crank Position Sensor

I‚Äôve got the car scheduled to go to a local mechanic on Tuesday for diagnostic work and the aforementioned exhaust leak, but just curious if the Reddit auto repair community has anything to contribute. 

The car is well maintained and has had regular fluid changes its whole life, and problems have been addressed promptly as they have rose.

1n2x5fq,Vibration in steering wheel when hot outside - one year of trying to get a diagnosis,"Car is a Buick Verano 2016 with 190 000 km, 2.4L engine.

Last summer, I started noticing that my steering wheel was shaking when idling, but only when quite hot outside, so when air conditioning is working hard, accompanied by a rhythmic groan. 

I went to my usual garage, who told me the compressor of my air conditioning was getting old and may have to be replaced within one year. 

At the beginning of the summer, on a day where it was hot, I went to see a garage specialized in air conditioning - they only do that. He lifted the hood, got his stethoscope out, looked and listened. He told my compressor was fine, that it looked like the tensioner. He went with me to the garage right beside, where I have already been in the past, explained that to the mechanic there who gave me an appointment for two weeks later. 

Two weeks later, it was not a hot day, so the problem was not there. He did an inspection, told me everything was fine with my car, and to come back on a day where it was hot. 

I come back on a day where it's hot. That mechanic from the other day was on vacation that day. Another mechanic looks at it very quickly, can't see what the issue is, tells me he's too busy today and gives me an appointment for when the other dude will be back from vacation. 

Two weeks pass again. I come for my appointment. It's not a hot day. He does an inspection again, tells me I have a bad engine mount at front right. He says he needs to order the part from GM. Gives me another appointment. 

Come back for the appointment. I'm unlucky again, it's not a hot day. He replaces the engine mount. He tells me any remaining vibration would be because of the age of the engine and he would not be able to do more.. well it changed absolutely nothing. 

I look on Google Maps for other garages with good ratings. I phone, explain it only happens when it's quite hot outside. They tell me they're very busy and can only work with appointments quite ahead of time. 

When I go, again, it's a day with very mild temperature. I talk with the mechanic, explain the issue. He asks me to go with him in the garage where he plugged his computer and activates at high speed the fan of the radiator, engine off. Issue reproduced. It creates that big vibration in the steering wheel. I tell myself ""Eureka this is it!"" Orders a new fan, take an appointment for this week. 

When I go this morning, it's quite cold outside, 10 degrees Celsius. He replaces the fan. I go home.. but then, in the afternoon, when the sun was out, the vibration is there again!!!! 

I'm really getting at the end of my patience!! I spent hundreds in diagnosis and replacing parts with no result! Otherwise, the car drives well and is in good condition. Cars are so expensive nowadays, I can't really afford another one... That vibration is not normal, it was not there before. I know something is not right.

What strategy can I use to be able to get the mechanics see the issue when it's happening? What could it be? How can I get this fixed without spending again hundreds in inspections and diagnosis?

Also, another issue that started a few months ago. I have a vibration in the steering wheel, sometimes, on the highway. The tires have been rebalanced like five times. The car has been inspected and reinspected. I asked to drive myself with the technician. He says he wasn't feeling nothing. I put my hand on the steering wheel and say I feel it and he says: ""that? *Laughs* no. That's because of the pavement, it's normal vibrations.

I used to absolutely love this car until this started appearing. If I could a new car, I would need financing, and the recent used cars for which you can get financing are so expensive, and all less comfortable than my Buick. Put I cannot afford another 1500$ or more in a diagnosis, replacing parts that don't help anything etc. If my issues are not diagnosed quickly ... I don't see myself continuing paying more with no realistic solution being offered.

ChemistAdventurous84 (Score: 1): The thing that needs to remain full is the radiator. When hot, coolant expands and travels from the radiator to the reservoir. When the engine is hot (operating temperature) the reservoir is expected to be at the ‚Äúfull hot‚Äù level. As the engine cools after being turned off, the coolant inside the radiator contracts and draws coolant from the reservoir back into the radiator. When fully cool, the reservoir should be at the ‚Äúlow full‚Äù level.

NightKnown405 (Score: 1): You are on the right path, you just need a few more tools and some experience (training) on how to apply them to diagnose the problem. 

Diagnostics is about asking questions and then either coming up with a way to answer that question with logic based on what has already been observed or by testing.

 One question that could be asked is ""Does it have spark the whole time it is trying to run?""
Connecting a tool like an ST-125 would allow you to watch and see if the spark keeps occurring all the way until the engine quits running or if the spark goes away first. 

Another question is. ""Is the engine getting enough fuel?"" A common routine is to supply an alternative fuel such as propane, or ether. If the engine keeps running or runs better with the alternative fuel that actually helps answer the first question too, because you would have to have spark to ignite the fuel. 

Once you have started narrowing your focus by figuring out what is working and what is not, then you can reset your testing to start proving ""why"" it's losing ""xxxxxxxxx"". 

Do you have a fuel pressure gage? Have you checked the quality of the fuel? Can you hear the injectors clicking while you keep this running on alternative fuel? Start getting answers to these questions and you will come up with the answer to what is wrong."

1n3n9w5,Crank no start (97 Camry),"Hey all, recently I‚Äôve done a tune up involving: 

Spark plugs

Injector rebuild (just seals and gaskets)

Plug wires, coil pack

Intake manifold gaskets


This is all on a 97 Camry with the 1mz fe.  After doing spark plugs, everything was fine. Ran it, no misfires.. come time to drive it again few days later, it began misfiring on cylinders 2,4 and 5.
Because it‚Äôs a PITA to take off the intake manifold to check the sparks, I opted to replace mostly everything in that area, as a preventative. As such, injectors, gaskets, and wires were next, and after reassembly I get a crank no start. It started for a split second with the pedal to the ground, and my whole garage smoked up. 

Further, when cranking it sounded like it wanted to start, and after letting off the ignition, there was a popping (pressure buildup?) near the injectors. It smelled like fuel.

Pulled the manifold back off, checked the plugs and they are carbon fouled, (dry black). Leads me to believe it‚Äôs the injectors, but not sure. 
Any advice at all gents? 

I do not think it‚Äôs sensor related, mainly because the car was fine up until I decided to touch it..",1,1756511990.0,2,AskMechanics,1756582341,2025-08-29 23:59:50,2025-08-30 19:32:21,Responsible_Gas_4060 (Score: 1): Before you did any type of work you should've been reading fuel trims.It can give indication on what's going on..

1n3fz8u,Could a power steering leak be confused for a motor oil leak?,"2010 Civic, approx 160k miles

Hi all. I'm kinda dumb when it comes to auto repair so I'm hoping someone can help me out here.

I usually get my oil changed at Valvoline. The past 4 times I've gone, they noted evidence of an oil leak and recommended that I visit a mechanic. After the second time, I went to my regular mechanic, who found some small things needing repair but no evidence of an oil leak. Valvoline still made the same comments when I went back to them later. 

Here's the thing - I've had this issue happen for months where my car makes a ""whirring"" kind of noise when accelerating. It gets worse until I get an oil change, and then it's fine for a while again. 

Idiotically, I never tried to investigate this for myself until recently. I found a couple people with the same issue, and the answer was power steering fluid! I checked my power steering fluid, it was very low, dark, and grimy. I bought a bottle of fluid, flushed the old stuff out, and refilled it. Almost immediately fixed the issue. 

That's when I realized that Valvoline would often top off my fluids when I'd get my oil changed, which, to me, ""fixed"" the issue for a while each time. 

I'm assuming this means I probably have a power steering fluid leak. Would it be possible that that was the issue the whole time, and it was being mistaken for motor oil? When self-diagnosing my car, I checked the oil levels (last change was 1.5 months ago) and dipstick showed it completely fine.

It's probably a failed rectifier diode. If the diode shorts, it creates a path for battery current to flow backwards through the alternator with the engine off.  

Edit: I guess I should add just in case - a quick multimeter check in diode mode between the terminal and the case will show if the diode has shorted - it should only conduct one way.  If it conducts both ways, that's your drain.  You can also check for AC volatage at the battery - a healthy alternator will have almost no AC ripple, where a bad diode will show a lot.

1n2ztk4,2012 Lexus ls460 problems,"*I'm going to go into detail about everything just in case there's some correlation between the problems that I'm having. Scroll down to the bottom for the **TLDR** if you need to. I put a picture of the connection that's damaged in the comments.*

I¬†bought a 2012 Lexus ls460 about a year & a ¬Ω ago and hadn't had a single problem with my car until I got my oil changed at Walmart about 4 months ago. I noticed about a week after I got the oil changed that it had a small oil leak. It progressively got worse and I asked a friend that is a mechanic what I needed to do & he told me to replace the oil filter housing cap. So I drove to Autozone got a aftermarket metal oil filter housing cap to replace the cracked plastic OEM one & was going to take it back to his shop the next day so he could put it on.
¬† ¬† ¬†The next day, I crank my car up & after it turned over, it immediately stalls out. When I went to crank it up again, it cranked right up, but you could hear that the engine was running roughly, the check engine light, & the trac off light came on. I tried to see if it would drive & make it up to the shop, but I was getting very little power from the engine when I pressed the gas & it wouldn't go faster than 15-20mph or come out of 1st gear. I checked the code and it was a P0101, so I took the MAF sensors out & tried to clean them with MAF sensor cleaner, but that didn't work so I ordered 2 new MAF sensors.¬†

While I was waiting on the MAF sensors to come in the mail, I had my car towed to my friend's shop so that he could install the new oil filter housing cap while I waited on the new MAF sensors. He was really busy, so it took him about 2-3 days to get to my car, but when he did, he couldn't move it to work on it, because the battery was dead. When he tried to charge it, the charger said it was a bad battery which is really strange, because I just bought this battery from Sam's Club about 9-10 months ago & it never gave me any problems except for their was a lose connection at the terminals at one point & my car died a few times, but I tightened the connection after I realized what it was & hadn't had a problem with the battery since. Anyways, I went to my local Lexus dealership & bought a battery from them & took it up to the shop. He installed it & installed the new oil filter housing cap & filled my car up with oil, but it was still running poorly & stalling with a P0100/P0101 code.¬†

I got the MAF sensors in the mail & took them up to the shop & replaced them. While we were replacing the MAF sensors, the connection that goes to the MAF sensor on the right side(driver side) was messed up & coming apart.(I'll attach a picture), but we carefully we were able to disconnect the old MAF sensor & replaced it with the new 1. Then we replaced the other MAF sensor. We cleared the code & the engine cranked right up and sounded great.

I drove home(about a 12mi/20min drive) and it drove perfectly. It was accelerating a lot better & the only thing that I noticed was that the speedometer seemed like it was saying that I was going about 5-10mph faster than I was. I may be wrong, but it just seemed like that at one point & my GPS app was saying I was going about 5mph less. Other than that, it drove very smoothly. I even stopped, turned off the car, & got gas and everything cranked right up with no problems. I get to my house & my gf needed to go to the grocery store about 4 hrs after I got back with the car & when she turned it on, the check engine light & trac off light came on. The engine was still running smoothly & I drove it around the block and noticed no issues. I checked the code & now it's giving me a P0171(Lean code on Bank 1) code.¬†

I'm trying to figure out if that code could be due to the MAF sensor connector being damaged. Or I noticed that it looks like air is seeping out of one of the hoses that connects to the air filter, but it's on completely & I zip tied it tighter just for good measure. I also read that someone was having similar problems due to a loose terminal connection with the battery that was giving the same codes & problems and I know that I had that issue before & it would explain the reason why my battery went bad so quickly. Or if it meant the MAF sensors that I just bought were faulty, but it's only giving the code for bank 1 so wouldn't it give the code for both if they were faulty MAF sensors?¬†

If anybody has experience with some of these same problems or might have some insights into what it is going on, that would be really helpful. Thanks.

**TLDR:** My car started having issues & gave a P0101 code so I ordered new MAF sensors. Then, a battery that I've had for less than a year died & when I tried to have it charged, the charger said it was a bad battery. I've only had problems with a lose connection to the terminal that I thought I fixed a while back, but I bought a new battery & replaced it, along with 2 new MAF sensors. It drove great at 1st, but a few hours later when I cranked the car, I got a check engine light with a P0171 code. One of the connections to the MAF sensor is damaged and I'm wondering if that could be the cause or if it could be the battery connection or something else. I've attached pictures to where the damaged connector.¬†",2,1756448408.0,3,AskMechanics,1756582341,2025-08-29 06:20:08,2025-08-30 19:32:21,"6h0st_901 (Score: 1): https://preview.redd.it/aucjwv11jwlf1.jpeg?width=6120&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b92a75e3ea75b49bd0b67f66997eaeabc08955e

Looking for some input because I‚Äôm getting conflicting info from my dealer.

**Car:**¬†2011 BMW 328i xDrive (E90, N52 engine) less then 90k miles and automantic 

**Backstory:**

* I brought my car into BMW for an FRM (footwell module) issue ‚Äî blinkers and windows stopped working after a jump start.
* While it was in, they also told me the¬†**belt was misaligned.**¬†I had noticed a little shake/noise on startup before, which I figured lined up with a belt/tensioner issue (a past mechanic also told me it would need attention eventually).
* They also performed a¬†**recall involving the engine**¬†the recalles where (Blower Motor Wiring, VANOS Bolts Recall, and Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) Valve Heater Recall).

**The problem:**  
After a¬†**week in the shop**, they gave the car back to me ‚Äî and now it‚Äôs doing¬†**extreme shaking and gargling sounds from the exhaust.**¬†These symptoms absolutely did¬†*not*¬†exist before service.

* I told them right away before even accepting the car back, because I was honestly scared to drive it in that condition.
* At this point I feel like they either messed something up during the recall/FRM work or they‚Äôre chasing the wrong problem.

**What the dealer is saying now:**

Yes there is! I will send you the estimate. The valve cover has a slight crack in it that is allowing unmetered air into the engine. On top of that the VANOS system is showing a large amount of wear and is contributing to the rough idle. Our recommendation is to start with the valve cover replacement.

**My concern:**  
I 100% believe this is connected to the recall work they did, not just random wear and tear. Before service, I never had rough idle, loss of power, or slow starts only the minor belt noise/shakeing on cold startup.

**My question:**

* Does the VANOS system really ‚Äújust go bad‚Äù like this overnight?
* Could VANOS actually cause extreme shaking and exhaust gargling without loss of HP or any codes?
* Or does this sound more like something disturbed during their recall/engine work?

Any insight would be super helpful before I let the dealer push me into a valve cover + VANOS repair.",2,1756443626.0,4,AskMechanics,1756582341,2025-08-29 05:00:26,2025-08-30 19:32:21,"Answulf (Score: 2): I think you are 100% correct.  The VANOS system doesn't just die overnight, it's progressive and almost always sets codes when it's bad.  If it was bad enough to shake violently, you would see timing faults and a loss of drivability.  The sudden onset right after their recall work - especially VANOS bolt work - makes that the #1 suspect.

Request a full fault code printout, make sure they verified all connectors, vacuum lines and intake boots. Maybe more importantly, go get a second opinion at an independent BMW specialist.  They will probably spot a loose hose or unplugged solenoid in 10 minutes.

1n2x42m,Vibration in steering wheel when it's hot outside - one year of trying to diagnose,"Car is a Buick Verano 2016 with 190 000 km, 2.4L engine.

Last summer, I started noticing that my steering wheel was shaking when idling, but only when quite hot outside, so when air conditioning is working hard, accompanied by a rhythmic groan. 

I went to my usual garage, who told me the compressor of my air conditioning was getting old and may have to be replaced within one year. 

At the beginning of the summer, on a day where it was hot, I went to see a garage specialized in air conditioning - they only do that. He lifted the hood, got his stethoscope out, looked and listened. He told my compressor was fine, that it looked like the tensioner. He went with me to the garage right beside, where I have already been in the past, explained that to the mechanic there who gave me an appointment for two weeks later. 

Two weeks later, it was not a hot day, so the problem was not there. He did an inspection, told me everything was fine with my car, and to come back on a day where it was hot. 

I come back on a day where it's hot. That mechanic from the other day was on vacation that day. Another mechanic looks at it very quickly, can't see what the issue is, tells me he's too busy today and gives me an appointment for when the other dude will be back from vacation. 

Two weeks pass again. I come for my appointment. It's not a hot day. He does an inspection again, tells me I have a bad engine mount at front right. He says he needs to order the part from GM. Gives me another appointment. 

Come back for the appointment. I'm unlucky again, it's not a hot day. He replaces the engine mount. He tells me any remaining vibration would be because of the age of the engine and he would not be able to do more.. well it changed absolutely nothing. 

I look on Google Maps for other garages with good ratings. I phone, explain it only happens when it's quite hot outside. They tell me they're very busy and can only work with appointments quite ahead of time. 

When I go, again, it's a day with very mild temperature. I talk with the mechanic, explain the issue. He asks me to go with him in the garage where he plugged his computer and activates at high speed the fan of the radiator, engine off. Issue reproduced. It creates that big vibration in the steering wheel. I tell myself ""Eureka this is it!"" Orders a new fan, take an appointment for this week. 

When I go this morning, it's quite cold outside, 10 degrees Celsius. He replaces the fan. I go home.. but then, in the afternoon, when the sun was out, the vibration is there again!!!! 

I'm really getting at the end of my patience!! I spent hundreds in diagnosis and replacing parts with no result! Otherwise, the car drives well and is in good condition. Cars are so expensive nowadays, I can't really afford another one... That vibration is not normal, it was not there before. I know something is not right.

What strategy can I use to be able to get the mechanics see the issue when it's happening? What could it be? How can I get this fixed without spending again hundreds in inspections and diagnosis?

Also, another issue that started a few months ago. I have a vibration in the steering wheel, sometimes, on the highway. The tires have been rebalanced like five times. The car has been inspected and reinspected. I asked to drive myself with the technician. He says he wasn't feeling nothing. I put my hand on the steering wheel and say I feel it and he says: ""that? *Laughs* no. That's because of the pavement, it's normal vibrations.

I used to absolutely love this car until this started appearing. If I could a new car, I would need financing, and the recent used cars for which you can get financing are so expensive, and all less comfortable than my Buick. Put It cannot afford another 1500$ or more in a diagnosis, replacing parts that don't help anything etc.

I quickly noticed via my phone flashlight though that it was the wrong color.

1n2vxjo,Anything else I should check for before replacing my cat?,"So I've got my inspection coming up soon, and I wanna actually pass so I need to pass my emissions, and I could have a failing cat on my hands.

I've got a 2012 Ford Focus SE, 2.0L Inline 4 at 90,958 miles, new transmission at 69k miles, regular oil changes at 5k miles when the car tells me to. At the beginning of this year before I REALLY researched cars, specifically Mk3 focuses, I thought as a self tune up I'd change the spark plugs... with some cheap crap I got at auto zone. Not long after I got P0420, Replaced my upstream sensor, code came back after 50 miles, and was spotty. After 3 Warm ups it'd disappear on its own, and come back randomly. Caked my mechanic and he recommended I get Ford Motorcraft plugs, and run some CataClean, he said more than likely those cheap spark plugs caused excess carbon build up or something I forget the exact terms he used, I bought Ford Motorcraft Spark plugs for it, the ones specifically for it and when I took the coils out, they were full of oil. I called him up, he said Valve Cover Gasket replacement, I asked him how much that would be and how long, I brought it in and got it back in an hour and a half, did the CataClean by getting down to a quarter tank, driving on the highway for 15 minutes, filling up with the most premium gas for the car, drove at 80mph down the highway for an hour, came home, P0420 not only came BACK but I noticed a distinct oil smell coming from my car, I pop the hood and oil is EVERYWHERE. Turns out the gasket had rolled and gotten pinched, He replaced it for free, I ran CataClean again after an oil change and yet...again, oil smell. I open the hood to see a lot of oil, not as much but still a lot. Crack in my valve cover, he replaced that for free, I ran CataClean AGAIN, still. P0420. He told me I can do a spacer or just replace it. I chose spacer since a replacement is pricey, spacer worked for a decent amount of time, I also replaced the downstream sensor in the meantime. Worked for about a month, when P013a popped up, I removed one of the spacers, and I havent driven 50 miles yet to see if P0420 will come back but I have a feeling it will. If it does and I replace the catalytic converter, is there ANYTHING else I should check for? Anything else that could be causing my cat to go bad? Double check my spark plugs for a bunch of oil?

57k miles v6 variant. Mostly towner driven, very few long trips after the first couple years.  
Owned new by her.  
She took it in and got a report that detailed a few things.

One was an oil leak, after watching several videos and researching.  
I also had my brother look at it. It seems likely the common issue with the oil filter causes this.  
It was puddled in the exact same place as the teardown video.  
Though the report seemed to suspect head gasket?

  
The other leaks were the ""transmission service"" and struts.

""Inner CV axel boots coated with a residue""

I know computers not cars so far, but I'd like to learn more with this car as I go.

I figure I would first prioritize double checking the leak and then replace the filter housing with the aluminum variant.

After that I'm not sure how to consider the other noted issues.  
Leaks sound serious to me, but to what extent(?)

Fluids were all good last we checked too.

Taking the plastic oil filter housing as an example.  
This has an aluminum option, but the default is a commonly breaking plastic one.  
Are there any other things like this that can be dealt with over time?

Any gas mileage or overall performance/longevity improves that can be added to the priority list?

Being a techy I did some digging on implementations of graphene for vehicles.  
Found that some vehicle models are finally using it in parts, I'm curious how good this is turning out, but it doesn't seem clear yet.

[Anyone ever try these?](https://www.graphenoil.com/)

I'm also looking to update the battery.  
I try to use newer style batteries like Lithium anywhere I can and the location of the battery seems to kind of suck. So, something that lasts and can potentially have a higher overall capacity would be fantastic.

It‚Äôs an extremely common problem on these engines. I would recommend replacing with the aluminum version. I have never had any recurring issues with the aluminum ones. 


Struts and a transmission service are easy upsells and easy money for shops so I‚Äôm not entirely convinced there are issues here. Inspect the struts and if they‚Äôre not broken or otherwise damaged, you‚Äôre likely fine. The transmission I would clean with brake cleaner if it has residue on it then drive around and monitor for leaks. 


Cv axles are another easy upsell so again, a visual inspection is invaluable. If the boots are torn, they need to be replaced. 


Every one of these engines that I have worked on have had issues with the camshafts and lash adjusters. This is a big job and can get expensive so I would not recommend you tackle this yourself. 


Use a good full synthetic oil. The biggest thing is regular, on-time oil changes. If you do a lot of in town driving I would do oil changes every 3,000 miles. If you do majority of highway driving, you can extend that to 5,000. That may be a little overkill for some people but my philosophy is that oil changes are cheap and engines are not. I personally use Red Line high performance oil but it‚Äôs very expensive so it doesn‚Äôt fit everyone‚Äôs budget. On customer vehicles I use Mobil 1 full synthetic almost exclusively. Most modern full synthetic oils are just fine. Also use a good filter. There is a lot of conjecture on what filters are best but in my personal experience I have had the worst luck with Fram, Wix, and K&N. 


I personally use AGM batteries in all of my vehicles because they have higher cold cranking amperage than regular flooded batteries of the same group, but also because they have a high reserve capacity. The downside is a higher cost for AGM batteries. Your stock alternator won‚Äôt be enough to fully charge an AGM so you can either install an onboard battery charger and plug it in once a week to top of the AGM, or you can install a high output alternator with a custom 14.8v voltage regulator. If you install the high output alternator, you will also need to upgrade the power wires to a size that can handle the increased current."

* They were balanced, aligned and rotated about 3 months ago.

I took to pepboys they reset it & the message went away. 2 weeks later same issue. They said the car problem needs front new tires & alignment. They didn‚Äôt guarantee that was the issue but it could be the reason. I took it yesterday to autozone. Got a C1B00-86 steering angle sensor-signal invalid. Took it today to a mechanic he is saying it‚Äôs the rack & pinion? 

Does anyone have a ford & have experienced this issue? Could that be really the issue?

Freekmagnet (Score: 1): There was (is) a safety recall on that model year explorer for electric steering system failures.    The recall consists of a software update, and if that does not correct the problem they replace the steering rack and pinion assembly at no charge.     

  Pep boys did nothing to fix the problem, all they did was clear fault codes and send you out the door.    Tires and alignment are NOT going to fix this issue, that would be a waste of money.     Alignment is part of the free rack and pinion recall job.

   I would call your local Ford dealer and have them run your VIN number to see if the recall is still open on your car, or if it has already ben performed at some point in it's history.    If the recall work has not been done you can get it fixed for free.    Safety recalls do not expire.

1n3kft4,Peugeot 208 - Wet Belt Advice,"Hello, currently driving a Peugeot 208 1.2 Puretech Petrol Engine 2019 on finance - 2 years remaining out of the 4.

Recently had a service and MOT at reputable independent garage I have been going to for many years. They have advised the wet belt is not in great condition.

No engine lights or warnings other than the car beginning to drive a little rough - it is an automatic but sounds like it strains a little before going up each gear (sometimes a strange loud turbo sounding noise appears when going from 2nd into 3rd).

Spoken with Stellantis who told me to get in touch with Peugeot customer service. I called Peugeot customer service who confirmed (and sent me a back up email as I advised) that there is a ‚Äúspecial warranty extension covering the timing belt‚Äù. Require full proof of services and correct oil which I believe I have.

They explained that a diagnosis must be carried out by authorised dealership, my closest which is an Arnold Clark one will charge ¬£165 per hour and cannot confirm how many hours. I have emailed Peugeot to confirm whether this will be reimbursed if and when approved - no reply yet.

I have had quotes from local garages in the meantime to replace the full wet belt which includes PSA genuine timing belt kit, fan belt, water pump belt, oil and filter, sump removed and oil strainer cleaned, 1 years warranty on parts fitted - ¬£720 in total from a garage that I understand is very experienced with wet timing belts.

Swallow the ¬£165 fee, it'll take no more than an hour and you're potentially quids in getting a nearly free belt replacement.

I‚Äôm 20 now, but I passed my driving test (automatic) a few months ago when I was 19. I rushed into it and went for auto instead of manual, which I regret, but at the time I just needed a license quickly.

After that, I spent months looking for a car on Facebook/Autotrader but couldn‚Äôt find anything decent. Either the insurance was insanely high (even with a black box) or the cars were just not worth it.

Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt know much and asked someone else to help me buy it‚Ä¶ I think I got scammed. The car had loads of issues. After bringing it home and realizing how much money I was throwing away (especially on insurance), I decided it wasn‚Äôt worth it.

Since my parents are learners and their insurance is cheaper, I gave the car to them. A few weeks later they bumped it into a wall ‚Äî nothing major, but with repairs costing around ¬£500, ant the gearbox already bad. it wasn‚Äôt worth fixing. We‚Äôre just going to scrap it.

Now they‚Äôve bought another car (a 1.4L) and insured it with Admiral.

1n3gp77,Hit and Run at traffic lights - how common is this?,"Hey everyone, 

I've been driving for a few years but, for the first time I've been hit by another car and I'm not entirely sure what to do, especially as the other driver drove off without stopping!

I was waiting as you do at the traffic lights today when suddenly a car behind me collided with mine briefly, scraped the back off my car, and continued to proceed on its merry way in the lane next to mine. Of course, at this point, it was still such a shock but I kept an eye on them, naively expecting them to stop somewhere ahead so that we could make sure everyone was okay first and foremost and then exchange details etc.


What I didn't expect was for him to just drive off! Unfortunately, whilst there were plenty of people around who 'witnessed' the incident, the weather was also chucking it down at the time and everyone had soon left the area - including the driver who hit my car. I don't have a dashcam but my passenger managed to take pictures of the car's registration plate as the doofus was driving away.

Debating whether or not I should raise this with insurance. Actual damage on my car from initial inspection doesn't seem to be too substantial. Can't deny I'm slightly worried about any damage under the surface but my knowledge of cars is limited. 

Another worry at the moment is that, from reading other people's experiences online as well as offline conversations, it seems that some people have had their premiums go up for future renewals following such incidents. However, on the other hand, I've also heard of cases where, if the innocent party don't report it to their insurance, the other driver initiates the process in the meantime, insiduously claiming that the victim was the one that was at fault and somehow flipping the entire situation on its head.

I'm very new to all of this - any advice is really appreciated and this sub has always been an incredible source of informed and helpful responses (sadly, not the case in every subreddit)!

1n3ai1x,Insurance advice please!,"*Now resolved, declared incident through comparison site and it's bumped my price by ¬£30 and I have to swallow a ¬£55 admin fee from Churchill to cancel my policy... But much better than another ¬£308 going to them!*

Hello, I need some advice regarding something that's boiling my piss at the moment!

Had a letter from Churchill recently essentially, politely, accusing my wife of lying on her insurance quote/application. We haven't disclosed any claims during the application process because we were not aware of any claims having been made.

In April I was driving my wife's car with her and our children in it. We were driving down the side of a mountain in Wales, 20mph, and there were steep side roads coming down onto the road we were travelling along. Annoyingly I noticed (I say annoyingly as if I hadn't have noticed chances are we would have completely missed him!!) a child running hell for leather from the nearside down one of these steep side roads. It was at the last moment and through a hedge so I reacted by doing an emergency stop, it looked like he could go in front of our car from what I had briefly seen. As it happened the emergency stop was completed, his big toe was squashed under the tyre and he ran into the front passenger side of the car. 

Really traumatic experience for all involved but the child's mum was really understanding and absolved us of any responsibility at the scene. Ambulance and police were called but the attendance time was hours for both so the lad was scooped up into a family members car and taken to hospital.

We called our insurance and told them about the incident and then called 101 and reported the incident to police fully giving all our details... This is legally what is required so being law abiders we duly did it. 

Police contacted us and told us the mum was very apologetic, her son is non verbal and has severe ASD, she lost control of him and he bolted. She sent her thanks for stopping, administering first aid and generally being calm, she didn't want us to worry and she again reiterated to police that she felt the incident was her responsibility.

Called insurance company and told them this. Happy days, no lasting injuries for her lad and no insurance claims. 

Fast forward to now... 

Insurance price comparison asks if you've made any claims in the last five years... That's a no. Think nothing more of it and take out insurance.

Now Churchill are suggesting we have committed fraud, want ¬£308 to make the policy right, or they will cancel it in seven days. I know this would be very bad and make it near impossible to get decent insurance quotes again. 

We spoke to our previous insurance company (Allianz) who stated no claim has been made against us and we haven't made a claim as no damage was sustained to our car. HOWEVER they state that the incident is left open for nine months in case of any claims...they've sent us a pdf explaining this and we have sent this to Churchill. Allianz also said they would be happy to talk to Churchill directly.

Churchill have said as it is an open claim... (With no bloody claim attached to it!) They are still within their rights to charge us ¬£308. They have them said that we would be within our rights to ask for a refund, pro rata, once that claim is closed but we have to pay it or our policy will be cancelled.

I feel like this is absolutely ludicrous and that they are taking the mick? They want extra money for  something that hasn't happened and then have the cheek to say they will refund it PRO RATA from the date the open case is closed. So I'll have paid them extra premium for something that essentially will then not have happened?! 

I want to know if anyone knows if this is actually legal and if I can appeal it anyway.

Things, like they are for everyone right now, are tight and ¬£308 isn't an insubstantial amount of money. The policy itself cost less than this!

The way I see it is I have a few options but really can't decide what's for the best:

1) Just come off her policy for the time being until the case is closed. Althought I don't know if this helps as it was her policy the claim was made against?
2) Shop around and disclose this non claim and pay a premium for it for the next five years, assuming the systems will then think I've got a claim against me.
3) Choke on the fact I have to pay this money. 

Any ideas? Really appreciate it's a long post. No wonder people hate insurance companies. Feel like we are bent over for doing the right things.

Summary:
Kid ran into side of our car. No claim made. Case outstanding with insurance in case a delayed claim comes in. Insurance company being sharky and demanding double the policy price or cancelling our policy. Then saying once the case is closed and no claim made they will refund the additional policy price pro rata from today's date to whatever date it drops offüòÇ.

Edited for horrific sentence structure. It's still no great but ü´°. Also added the fact it was her policy the open claim was made against so I don't know if me dropping off even helps üò¨.

1n37uj0,(Re-uploaded now in full) Have I been sold a dud car?,"Deleted my previous post as from what I saw, only the pictures of this year's and last year's MOTs showed up but not the text and people were quick to draw conclusions without the story so here it is,  
  
Bought a Mazda 2 from a private seller as my first car back in mid-August. The seller was wanting ¬£1,800 for the car without an MOT or ¬£2,000 + any repair costs with an MOT. The MOT expires on the 12th of September. I decided to take it without the MOT as even if it needed any repairs, I thought they would be minimal considering the 3 advisories from the previous year had been complete and the previous year's mileage and it would work out cheaper. I did all the pre checks I could when I bought it which included a look underneath from the front and rear but without a jack or a lift, it was extremely difficult to see fully underneath. Had it in today for the MOT and it failed as one of the springs had fractured and a rear axle offside swivel pins/bush was excessively worn. Quoted ¬£440 for the repair of both including the nearside swivel pins/bush which was an advisory for lightly worn as was told that there wouldn‚Äôt be any additional labour to do both so just needed to pay for the part. At face value this doesn‚Äôt sound bad until I tell you I have a list of 17 advisories, of which most if not all will be needing done by the next MOT and some of the corrosion elements I fear may be terminal.   
  
One of my main reasons for buying the car was because of its good MOT history and mileage as it passed on all of its previous MOTs apart from 2 (last year as pictured and back in 2017 for the same fault on the opposite track rod and never had more than 3 advisories on any MOT). It‚Äôs only done just over 50,000 miles total and 4,000 miles last year despite being 14 years old. I know it‚Äôs a part of life but I can‚Äôt help feeling quite angry and really upset. In hindsight I should of just went to a garage to buy a car or let the seller do the MOT for ¬£200 extra and when I saw the failure points and amount of advisories pull out of the sale but all that matters now is I didn't I have to face the consequences.

Also a point on the garage, was told on the phone after it had failed to come down and collect it and bring it back on Monday morning for the repairs and that I'd be okay to drive over the weekend if I needed to however after walking down to the garage, I was told if my car leaves the garage, my current MOT and insurance would be invaild so I decided not to risk it and leave it there. I believe they may be right about the insurance howeve, the DVSA disagrees about the MOT being invaild as they say as long as the current MOT is still vaild and there was no dangerous faults I could take it away. I wasn't planning to drive it over the weekend anyway knowing it had the faults but would of preferred to have it home where I could keep an eye on it rather than it being left in an car park over the weekend which only has a chain across it so no security at all stop someone getting in.

1n36zwu,Should I get the government grant for EV?,"Early August, I agreed on the purchase of a brand new Cupra Born V3, with an important discount due to the fact of the incoming 75 plates, to be delivered early September. I left a ¬£500 deposit for it.  
The dealer sent an Order form with a detail of the price of the vehicle, discounts, fees, taxes, etc., which I signed and returned.  
More recently, Cupra lowered the price of their base Born trim, so now it's less than ¬£37k and qualifies for the ¬£1500 government grant (and it's already listed in the respective [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/plug-in-vehicle-grants/cars) page).

I asked the dealer about it, and he said this discount is already included in the original discount, but my understanding is I should get an extra ¬£1500 discount on the car. My reasoning is that:

1. There is no mention of the government grant discount on the order form.
2. The Born qualification for the grant happened after I was offered the original discount, so the ¬£1500 could be added to the original discount and should make no difference to the dealer, they would be able to recover it from the government.

Personally, I'd be taking the cheaper option. A reconditioned turbo will be as good as any new turbo in almost all cases.

Urban life? The suzuki WagonR sold many units here and theyre bomb proof.

And car enthusiasts looking for something small and fun should just save the pain of finding kei car parts and buy an MX-5/Eunos.

1n2u35y,Advice and Recommendations on Next Car,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôm looking for some advice on buying a car and could really use your input. I‚Äôm struggling a bit with figuring out what‚Äôs actually a good deal these days.

For context ‚Äì my last car was a VW Scirocco (owned from 2013‚Äì2020) which I loved driving, so I‚Äôm aiming for something with a similar feel or better this time around.

**Budget:** Around ¬£15k + trading in my dad‚Äôs 2017 Vauxhall Astra (hoping to get ¬£2‚Äì3k for it). That means I could stretch to around ¬£18k, but ideally I‚Äôd like to keep costs down if possible.

**Use case:** Based in London (needs to be ULEZ compliant), mainly city driving with occasional trips outside the city. I‚Äôd like to keep the car for \~5 years.

**What I‚Äôm unsure about:**

* Mileage vs. age ‚Äì I used to think ‚Äú5‚Äì6 years old, under 50k miles‚Äù was the sweet spot, but I‚Äôm not sure if that rule of thumb still applies.
* Reliability & running costs ‚Äì how do these cars typically hold up in terms of maintenance, servicing, and the likes?

**Cars I‚Äôm considering (rough order of preference):**

* Mercedes-Benz C-Class
* Audi A5
* BMW 4 Series
* Mercedes-Benz A-Class
* Audi A3
* Mazda 3 (looked at as cheap alternative, but does not really seem that cheap)
* Ford Focus (looked at as cheap alternative, but does not really seem that cheap)

I‚Äôm mostly after a coupe, but I‚Äôd consider a hatchback if a coupe stretches the budget too much.

Any thoughts or experiences with these models would be hugely appreciated ‚Äì especially around reliability, long-term running costs, and what to look out for when buying. I‚Äôve also linked a few examples of cars I‚Äôve been eyeing up.

Thanks in advance! üôè
