1momayd,"Fuel shutoff solenoid works, then... doesn't?","Hoping to get some insight, even general here. Because I and my co-worker have been banging our heads on this one for over a week.

We're working on airport GSE for the airlines and have a belt loader with a Deutz F4L1011F diesel that just refuses to start with a fuel shutoff solenoid installed. The problem was originally thought to be the old failed solenoid not allowing fuel to the rails. And lo, when we removed it, she's dead Jim. We ordered a new solenoid, same issue. Returned it thinking bad stock and got a new OEM one instead. Same issue. But we oddly noted that, once we REMOVED the solenoid from the system... engine starts and runs perfectly fine. (We have to use the manual fuel shutoff mounted on the rail for now).

We've checked power and ground at the solenoid plug. Both are good, with 12.4v at the power wire (engine off) and 13.6v (engine on). When we plug the solenoid in and hold it, works fine. The moment we bolt it into the engine, it fails to operate. While we were troubleshooting, we put the solenoid (still plugged in) on top of the alternator and tried again... dead solenoid. Lifted the solenoid 2 inches high off the alternator, it works.

Another colleague thinks we have a grounding issue. But we know the solenoid grounds solid through the ground wire on the plug (this wire runs through the E-Stops and then ultimately to ground). By the very nature that it operates fine when held in your hand, that ground wire is the only source of ground and must be good. We also know that when the unit is plugged in, it will operate in all instances when it is NOT touching the engine block or the alternator. (We tried replicating the mounting angle in our hand, thinking something was just off, and this was not an issue).

We're stumped. The solenoid is good. Bench tested fine and works fine in the harness. It's just dying when we bolt it in or touch it to the engine in any way.

If anyone is SUPER curious, it's a TUG 660 belt loader from 2008.

1mom7zd,"Oil Leak, Need Head of Engine re-machined? $4000? Seriously?","2009 Mercury Grand Marquis (Crown Vic) 184k miles

So, I started having an oil leak a few months ago. Car would leak oil, and while driving I would get this burning smell coming through the vents with the a/c on, less so if I used max a/c. Opened the hood, looked at the engine, and there was clearly oil stains on top of the engine area around where plugs/coils are. I figured it was likely the valve cover gaskets as there was also oil streaming down the side of the engine. So, I paid for this shop to replace valve cover gaskets, which I do think was necessary. 

Anyway, the issue persisted, I still had an oil leak (though it was less oil) and I was still getting the burning smell. Took it back, and they ended up replacing one of the valve cover gaskets because it was defective/torn already (no idea why they put it in in the first place but anyway...). This seemed to work for a couple hours but eventually I noticed there was still a leak and I was still getting the burning smell. 

Took it back again and this time the shop said that there was a new leak, and it was from the engine head, and that the proper fix is to take the head off of the engine, send it into a machining shop, have them re-machine/grind down the head and then put it back on the engine. The Mechanic recommended I not do this, because it would cost between $3000-$4000 and my car would be in the shop for at least a month as they sent the head off and waited for it to be sent back. 

This whole situation is ridiculous to me since my car never had any major issues like this until I started a new job and began driving it more regularly (was work from home previous 2 years). 

The only other major issue I had was back in 2022 I had a spark plug shoot out of the engine itself and break the oil. I replaced the spark plug and coil. Then in 2023 I replaced all spark plugs and all coils. However, in 2024 the same spark plug shot out of the engine, and I was unable to replace it. I took it to a shop, and asked for them to do the Sertaline or Timesert (I forget what it's called) to repair the threads and put a new spark plug in. Instead, they installed an oversized spark plug, which works, and was cheaper. This happened about 9 months before the oil leaks began. 

I also took it to another shop for an oil change and had them glance at it, and the guy said he thought it was a rear main seal leak, but couldn't tell for sure without a more thorough inspection that I'd have to pay for. I did not pay for that. 

So now I am wondering what to do, do I just put Bar's Leak in it and clean it up and try to sell it? I'd hate to do that, but at this point I don't know what my options are. I do wonder if the oversized spark plug somehow lead to the head being warped and needing remachining, but I also wonder if maybe the original shop just couldn't ever figure it out and told me that story to get rid of me as a customer.

I’m looking for some help sourcing a small but crucial part for my 2016 Škoda Superb 2.0 TDI. It’s related to the AdBlue system — specifically, the water connector that goes to the AdBlue injector.

There’s a tiny black secondary lock / locking clip on the connector that holds it securely in place. Mine fell out and got lost, and now I can’t seem to find the exact replacement.

I’ve attached some photos for reference.
Does anyone know the correct part number, what it’s officially called, or where I can buy just the locking clip (without replacing the entire connector)?

So I been chasing this noise, took it to two shops both said rod bearings. Only happens on start ups and seems to be go away when fully warmed up like driving for 10 mins. Reving right past 1k rpms and letting off right after makes it rattle past that but going even 2k and past don't seem to hear it until it goes back down to 1k rpms. First thought it was the timing belt and tensioner. Bought 5k miles ago, the pervious owner had a shop install the gates kit. So I went ahead and installed the AISIN kit but with the gates belt from O'reilly's not the oem gates belt and the noise is still there. Did valve adjustment on both heads, followed  the shop manual and the noise is still there. So I redid the AISIN kit again thinking maybe, nope still there. Noise seems to be coming from the front cylinder head, mechanics think the same too. Took the front valve cover off and rocker and looked at the front cam turned it by the balancer bolt, looked good to no pitting on the lobes. Did a valve adjustment again. Didn't look at the back cam though would have been a lot more work. So I did the rod bearings per color codes off the crank. Bought all honda bearings for the up and bottoms bearings and plastigauge them all within sepc. The old bearings didn't look that bad a little shinny on the edges but that's it. Noise is still there. Lol I'm wondering if it could be because I didn't use the honda timing belt, pulleys, water pump and tensioner. Yeah AISIN might be the supplier of some of honda timing parts but maybe not all or made to the same spec? Idk or could it be the back cam I didn't check? I heard that could make a noise throught both heads and hard to pin point. Only other things I could think of is a wrist pin, piston slap or main bearings. But if it's a main bearing I'm not redoing that again. Lol if anyone can help that be great. Sorry for the long description.

I recently had my car inspected for suspension issues and upkeep. Shop recommended front control arms, ball joint and bushings replacement (needed with some other work) and front and rear struts and sway links (recommended). Had front control arms replaced (as well as work on muffler, rear brakes, and rear ball bearings at same time) as recommended. Less than two weeks after repair my front driver's side collapsed while driving (\~25mph).  Towed to shop and informed that my steering knuckle broke and will be $800 to $1,000 cost for repair. They were VERY explicit/careful in noting that it wasn't my or their fault and it wasn't something they could/would see during the inspection or repair but would cut the labor cost in half to do right by me and be fair. 

My question is how likely is it that they would miss issues with the knuckle during inspection/replacement and is it likely they damaged it during the control arm work?

Further context on reason for question: They broke the rear wheel sensor while replacing the rear ball bearings, bent the hanger when installing the muffler. They did not catch either before returning the car with a rattle on start up and dashboard lights showing issues.

1mohlsx,Feeling frustrated pls help me,"I got my AC fixed from the Honda dealer in December with a warranty 12 months or 12k miles.

It’s been broken all summer and I finally had time to bring it in to get fixed. I was feeling hopeful 🤞🏼lol

Anyways,  they’re saying they WONT cover the cost to fix it even tho I’m in the warranty window. 

Apparently, the “part” that is leaking wasn’t replaced last time and isn’t under warranty. Even though last time I had like the whole system replaced. Idk what’s up or down, if they’re telling me the honest truth or not. It’s frustrating bc I’ve been a loyal customer, not that they care, but I feel like there should be some sort of customer care here since I’ve always serviced my car there. 

They’re quoting me $1,158.98  for “The Expansion Valve And Recharge Ac
System.” 

I’m pretty reasonable and am frustrated they aren’t working with me. I’m going to try to negotiate but if they don’t honor the warranty or even offer to lower the price, I just won’t get it done. I don’t really even wanna give them the business anymore and go to a local shop

This is 100% it. Goes double because it's a Nissan CVT which is known failure prone.

> the fluid is now providing friction or something that is preventing things from slipping.

That's an urban legend surrounding conventional automatic transmissions with gears and hydraulic clutch packs, CVTs don't rely on that to begin with but that's also just a case of people coming up with their best guess to explain what is really just the cognitive bias where you blame transmission failure on the last thing you did to it (change the fluid) and not the underlying problem (not changing the fluid earlier). There's no basis to it that I've ever heard from engineers that actually study oils and lubrication. Wet clutches do rely on friction modifiers to not slip but those friction modifiers modify the properties of the oil, they don't stand in for missing clutch friction material. But CVTs don't have that, they have belts and rollers.

Find another shop that will change your fluid, fresh CVT fluid is the key to making a Nissan CVT last at all.

1mo6avm,Clunking and popping after front end work,"I did a bunch of DIY front end work to my 09 Kia Rio. I replaced the ball joints, bearings, control arms, sway bar links, CV axles, and had it aligned. Ever since the alignment, it makes two distinct noises. The first and more subtle noise occurs when I suddenly change speeds. If I tap my foot on the accelerator it will make a small noise I would call a click or small pop but I cannot pinpoint it. If I let my foot off the accelerator, it will click again.  It sounds like it's coming from the center of the car. The other more noticeable noise is a clunk when going over bumps as well as turning the wheel from left to right. If I start with my steering all the way to the left and then turn it all the way to the right, somewhere in the midpoint you will here a distinct clunk/loud pop and it's the same noise I hear when I go over bumps and things. Of course being a frugal driver of $2000 vehicles, I replaced all of those front end components with the cheapest that Rockauto had to offer (maybe therein lies my problem) so I would like to try and figure this out myself but I am not opposed to getting it to a mechanic and have their experience figure it out.

If it started smoking usually means the clutch is under alot of stress. Whether that be caused by too large of an air gap on clutch itself or the compressor is trying to lock up. Unfortunately to abide by epa guidlines if you try to replace the compressor yourself you wont be able to ""safely"" dispose or recycle the refrigerant. As for the compressor itself, though you would need to see if the lines going to the compressor have what we call ""black death"" which is tiny aluminum particals that get carried by the oil inside the system and cause more damage if you do not clean/replace more components. Best thing to do is take it to a shop and pay them to recover the refrigerant and do the work yourself. Then either recharge it yourself or have them do it. Biggest mistake ive seen people make though is using refrigerant with leak sealer in it. It can gum up parts of condenser or evaporator and make them less efective. Worst i had seen was the expansion valve completely filled shut with it. Whole system had to be replaced.

These warnings popped up as soon as I got back home from the four drive, I stopped for food 10 min from my house. I was able to drive back, went to work this morning as well. I tried looking up, called Acura, didn’t get a response so I left a message.

The only thing I can think of is when I was just looking up brakes for my Acura I remember seeing something about putting the car in a maintenance mode before working on the brakes because it’s an electric brake system. I don’t think my guy did that.

But once again idk it was fine all last week, it still is running just fine and I never use my my parking brake ever.

My girlfriends Fiat 500 (2009 plate) is overheating.

I checked the coolant levels and it seems to be OK. I noticed however that this part of the car, which I believe is the air intake hose, was not connected properly, due to the plastic mounting bit on the right hand side being snapped and not connected to the hose, meaning that part of the hose was not connected to the hole in the front bit of the chassis where it is supposed to go, just above the radiator.

I have glued it back together for now and was wondering if it would be safe to just drill a hole through the middle of the plastic mounting bit vertically, and use a nut and bolt to secure it along with the glue? Or a self tapping screw of some sort? Basically so it does not come loose and get sucked into the engine. The nut would be sat inside the tube itself.

Mercedes always traditionally will tell you to replace the entire exhaust when something happens. Can't tell you how many people we had come by for an exhaust fix after the dealer told them to replace everything for a couple of broken hangers and some rust. 

Its probably....

1. Cut exhaust at failure point OR split at failure point, depending on setup.

2. Replace electronic mechanism (likely not 1 piece with the exhaust, probably unbolts)

3. Test

I wonder if this could be as easy as pulling the exhaust apart and just cleaning it. Again, never tried, but seems straight forward enough to fix."

If its not a task you can do on your own you can hire the job out to a vinyl wrap specialist or try to cut ""strips"" to place in the high traffic areas.

Hey people, so I bought a new transmission pan + filter in the hopes of replacing this rusty, flaking one myself (my tran fluid is looking pretty good still so I'm not worried about that). I'm not noticing any leaks yet but I want to be preventative. My problem is, I realize the new pan didn't come with new bolts.

Do these bolts look too rusty to attempt to take them off? I don't wanna risk wrecking them and having to buy new ones.

I've looked online and the OEM bolts are part #: 9YAO10615A

They're pretty expensive for just a single bolt (on eBay $20 CAD/$15 USD) and I'd need 20 if I wanted to have all new ones. So as a second question: could I use non-OEM bolts?

So I went ahead and installed the AISIN kit but with the gates belt from O'reilly's not the oem gates belt and the noise is still there. Did valve adjustment on both heads, followed  the shop manual and the noise is still there. So I redid the AISIN kit again thinking maybe, nope still there. Noise seems to be coming from the front cylinder head, mechanics think the same too. Took the front valve cover off and rocker and looked at the front cam turned it by the balancer bolt, looked good to no pitting on the lobes. Did a valve adjustment again. Didn't look at the back cam though would have been a lot more work. So I did the rod bearings per color codes off the crank. Bought all honda bearings for the up and bottoms bearings and plastigauge them all within sepc. The old bearings didn't look that bad a little shinny on the edges but that's it. Noise is still there.

Yeah AISIN might be the supplier of some of honda timing parts but maybe not all or made to the same spec? Idk or could it be the back cam I didn't check?

In March current year I noticed the radiator fan suddenly turning on full power, cold engine hot engine basically the same thing, and the reservoir for coolant was almost always filled to the brim (I didn't think much of it since it had installed new ac and the nearby mechanics had to clear out the system etc. and fill it with coolant) after some time I decided to finally get some of this coolant out as it was overflowing and also get it to the mechanic asap, turns out it was missing around 1,5L of coolant and yet it was still overflowing. 

They changed the cap on the radiator thinking it could cause the issue if it was stuck open, but I returned shortly after as it was still overflowing and bubbling appeared. I was instantly brushed off and told it's the head gasket and we'll the repair would basically cost more than the car, so I went for a second opinion to another shop and I got treated way better, they did the head gasket test and the bubbles weren't exhaust fumes, oil was clean and no smoke near the exhaust. They checked and sealed all the hosing, changed the thermostat, and flushed the entire cooling system in case there was a clog. 

And... it was still bubbling, not to the point of overflowing but still bubbling, for the most part it was okay untill during a hot day 35°C I was sitting in traffic and I started smelling coolant, upon arriving home I noticed the upper hose fuming and spurting out coolant, there was a pretty big rip around 4-5cm. Took it to the mechanic for a quick fix and it's back to what it was:

- Coolant reservoir is overflowing, bubbles appear after the car gets warm (no cold start bubbles) 
- the fan instead of running all the time doesn't turn on at all UNLESS I have the ac on, then it works perfectly. 
- The temperature gauge on the dashboard never goes above the middle point, but it does work, cool engine - arrow down, slowing warming up - goes slowly up, sort of cooled down engine - same thing.

 And yet even when it's in the middle temps of 30°C outside after driving 40-50kms and now staying in traffic the fan is still off and the coolant just slowly burps out of the coolant expansion tank.

What I also noticed is that when I smell the coolant while driving (sort of tells me it's overheating and overflowing) I hear this like popping/cracking sound near my right foot (gas pedal) when accelerating or braking( could be related?). The moment I hear that I crack open the windows, turn on hot air at max fan speed and just smell for more coolant (this usually helps instantly)

Any ideas of what to change next? (Apart from the whole car)

 I'm losing hope I have a few trips planned that are longer than usual and driving for 6hours straight makes me wonder if it's going to die on me on the way. Or suddenly another hose will pop during regular driving. I'm guessing driving fast does cool it off from passive cooling of the wind?

That turbocharger looks like it's designed for ""small engines"" which usually means two stroke. I would probably spend the money on a nicer one, or at least a kit. 

If you want to build a go-kart, there are probably easier ways? You'll need a lot more parts than what's in this cart to make this setup work. You'll need plumbing and such for the turbocharger, belt and pulley modifications for the supercharger if this engine doesn't come with one from the factory, and wiring harness/ecm for the engine. If you're building a body from scratch, you'll need to give consideration to how you'll connect the engine to the wheels. 

I guess it's technically not the worst idea I've ever heard. But based just on this screenshot and the text I would caution you to make sure you know what all is involved in the process.

Edit: there's no real difference between a turbocharger for a two stroke and four stroke engine as far as I know, I just mean that it might not be engineered to work behind the increased power of a four stroke car engine, at least not long-term

""Yeah, we didnt notice anything. ""

Going to the mechanic is so frustrating. I hear this too often. My struts, especially in the rear are just about blown out. You can see the car sagging down. It's not safe to drive on the highway, it feels floaty and sways laterally.  I told them not to take it on the highway it's dangerous and he said he wants to take it out anyway. If he wants to risk his life and other people's lives and or crash my car I'll be really upset. 
Does he really have to take it out on the highway to tell if the struts are blown out when you can clearly see the rear sagging down ?

Transmission issues as well, car stutters/shudders in between shifts at I noticed 35mph. Other gears and speeds as well. ""Yeah we dont notice anything."" 

Transmission fluid was to my surprise pristine. I'm wondering if it's the torque converter. So many things in an auto trans can get messed up, ugh.

Also, there is a clicking noise letting off the gas or turning. It only happens once, is intermittent and not constant. Not cv joint, I know what that sounds like. He said he ""noticed it""and it's the axle spindle (not sure if I said that right)
Im almost certain when I get the car back the clicking will still be there. 

I get that it's hard to replicate issues, so many cars, so many normal and abnormal noises, but it's just so frustrating. I'm worried about the vehicle swaying as mentioned above. How tf do you not notice the car sagging in the back ?

1moeo93,Is buying and reinforcing a totalled car a terrible idea?,"Hello,

So I know that me posting this, everything I hear I should take with a grain of salt and that this is not professional advice. But really I'm just brainstorming here.

I'm thinking of purchasing a 2015 Toyota Yaris off of my buddy for $500. It has less than 90k in mileage and the engine runs relatively well. The only issue is that the vehicle was involved in a rear end collision with the front end pretty caved in, the frame being compromised and the interior airbags have been deployed. The incident was not provided to insurance so the vehicle's VIN officially does not have an accident on the record.

I will preface that I am a very experienced welder with fabrication experience and access to a nominal shop. I'm considering buying this car since the engine was relatively unaffected by the accident as well as the low mileage, I'll be using it as commuter for around the area I live. I live in CA by the way, so high gas prices and gridlock is my life so I don't expect to be in a high speed accident anytime soon. But my thoughts are to reinforce the engine bay with tube steel and welded plates as well as some chassis work and maybe even bars in the interior similar to a roll cage to prevent total crumpling. My goal is to have the vehicle basically Death Proof in the event of a collision, with 4 or even 5 point seatbelts since I don't trust myself to install aftermarket airbags successfully. I also know that some seatbelts have after market airbags installed but I'm still researching this.

I know this work all seems excessive for a totalled car, and I'm probably better off buying something more reliable but at this time my budget can't really afford that. Since I have access to this car for such a low price, and I'm able to acquire the steel for bascially free and the labor is all from myself, I think this is a worthy project.

Anyways, any feedback would be really appreciated.",0,1755018802.0,16,StupidCarQuestions,1755113715,2025-08-12 17:13:22,2025-08-13 19:35:15,"Adept_Ad_473 (Score: 7): Sounds like you have the means to do it and are managing expectations, so you may be an exception to the token response of ""don't waste your time""

1mobiba,My 2010 Chevy Cobalt constantly powers my Bluetooth transmitter,"So I have a 2010 Chevy cobalt, and since it doesn’t have Bluetooth, I use a transmitter to play music on my phone.

Is there a way to change/fix that or am I just stuck with it like that?

It wouldn’t be such a huge problem, but in the town I drive in, I get static in the background sometimes when I pass some buildings, as well as sometimes a truck will drive past me and I get whatever they’re playing for a moment.

Demache (Score: 2): So this is a really funny thing.

Your Cobalt is a GM vehicle designed for the North American market. GM has traditionally made the 12V outlet powered from the battery, and isn't key switched. Your Aveo is actually a rebadged Daewoo for the Asian market brought over to North America, since GM owns Daewoo. Asian manufacturers are bigger on key switched 12v outlets.

And that would also explain the radio difference. 87.5 overlaps with the spectrum for old analog TV in North America, so FM radios sometimes don't go that low. But FM radio in other countries do go that low, and your Aveo reflects that. GM just didn't bother giving it a different radio since it doesn't hurt anything.

Basically, your Aveo was designed for an entirely different market, so it has different sensibilities in mind.

You could get a key switched outlet in your Cobalt, but you are going to have to DIY. Maybe r/ChevyCobalt or r/Chevy may be able to advise on a solution.

The actual solution for the FM transmitter situation is installing an aftermarket radio with Bluetooth or an AUX jack. FM is less than ideal because of the exact reason you gave. It looks like it takes a double DIN radio so it probably wouldn't be too expensive. [Crutchfield.com](http://Crutchfield.com) can tell you exactly what you need.

1molo72,"New tires, brakes and alignment. What else would cause vibrations at high speeds?","Purchased a 2010 Ford Taurus a few months back. Previous owner was supposed old man who passed away. Car is in pretty good shape with 140k on it. Was told the front pads and rotors were replaced however he must have used cheap pads because the brake dust drives me nuts. 

So far I’ve had the front pads only replaced with Duralast Gold. Rear pads and rotors replaced and new master cylinder. Had the tires balanced when this was done. Rode smooth for a minute but vibration started again. Recently I thought I heard a wheel bearing going bad and vibration getting a little worse. 

Took car to trusted mechanic I used to work with. He said wheel bearings fine and visual inspection of suspension all looked good. However there was uneven wear on rear tire and some dry rot on tires. Replaced all 4 tires, mount and balanced no issue with wheels reported. Also had alignment done. 

Car still vibrates at high speed and even more so when braking from high speed. I figured there is a chance the guy who sold me car lied about new front rotors and just pad slapped it as there were new pads on rear as well but one rotor chewed up pretty good. 

Would warped rotors cause vibration at high speeds even when NOT braking? If not, what else would cause it? I’m thinking maybe motor mounts but wouldn’t I be able to see the engine shaking or vibrating even during idle and not just at high speeds. Could something be wrong with suspension that wouldn’t be noticeable with visual inspection? What else would cause vibration at 60mph+ only? Thanks for any helpful responses.

1mol9jw,"Pulling my hair out over this ""no start"" problem. what am I not thinking of?","Details of the car: 1997 Dodge ram B2500 van with 318 5.2

As the title says, I am pulling my hair out over this because it seems like it must be simple but I can't figure it out. My van will not start.

What it does when I turn the key: two clicks, maybe one click, no other noises. The entire power (dash, lights, everything) dies for about 25 seconds before it all comes back on. If I try again I might get clicks or I might get silence, but the power always goes out after the attempt and comes back about 20 seconds later.

What I have tried:

it's the battery, right? definitely the battery. I have a tester that even tells me CCA's. the battery is testing good, i have had it on a maintainer. After trying to start it a few times I test it again and it's bad. Ok, what gives. I take the battery out of the car and bring it to two different auto parts stores, they both tell me it's 100% good. 900 CCA's on a 810CCA battery. I take it back home, confused, test it with my tester, it's good. I put it back in the car. I try to start the car. Same issue when I turn the key. So, either it's not the battery or there is another way for a battery to be defective without showing up in tests?

Battery cables. I tested them with a multimeter as per youtube, there doesn't seem to be any voltage loss. I cleaned it all just in case, cause why not. Then I tested all the grounds I could find, they all seem good. I tried to start the car with a jumper cable on the negative battery terminal and the other end attached to the starter body in hopes to bypass a mysterious ground issue. No change. I tested the wire that goes directly to the starter from the positive battery terminal, it has 12 volts. I didn't test the ignition switch wire yet but I assume that isn't the problem because I can hear the solenoid going off in the starter when I turn the key.

As for the starter, I took out my old one and put in a new one. The car does not start. I took out the new one to return it, put the old one back in, the car started? This was back when the problem was more intermittent. Now I can't get any starts at all. I should mention that the van runs perfectly when it does start, so it's not fuel delivery or anything else. it doesn't even crank, just clicks. I haven't had my starter tested yet, but all of this leads me to believe it isn't actually the starter but it's somehow an electrical problem?

I was on a motorway with no hard shoulder, luckily was able to get the car into a lay-by before it stopped. There was a strong smell of burned clutch. We towed the car to the garage next morning.

There is a visible leak from slave cylinder area, which explains the malfunctioning pedal. 

The garage also says that because of the burning smell from clutch it is likely that the fluid ""leaked all over the clutch mechanism"" and the whole clutch needs to be checked and replaced. While it sounds  plausible, especially given the fact that gears slipped, they are also trying to claim some exorbitant sum for it, much higher than the market rate which makes me question their integrity somewhat. The problem is that to actually check the clutch is a lot of work which is the majority of the cost.

Check brake fluid level in master cylinder.  IIRC, you have drums in the rear.  The wheel cylinders like to leak.  Brakes are a hydraulic system, needs fluid to compress, then it needs something to create the compressing force, then it needs mechanical contact between the pads/shoes and rotors/drums.  When drum shoes aren't adjusted, they can act like this as well.

I drove it home and then stopped to get fuel two days later before starting a road trip to move several states over.  I made it about 100 miles before I lost a lot of power and there was a horrible grinding sound. I was able to make it to an exit to park. I was then towed to the nearest dealership for my brand of vehicle. They did a diagnostic and determined it was the transmission. The transmission has an extended warranty so it was to be covered. When the dealership went to work on the transmission they discovered the transmission has differential fluid in it and the differential was almost completely empty. 

So we reached out the mechanic who did the service. He says in order to submit a claim with his insurance he needs testing done on the fluid to prove to insurance they used the wrong one. The dealership is telling me the only company they know of for testing is out of Texas called SPL and costs thousands of dollars. 

Basically what I am asking for help with is are there companies that do this kind of testing and how do I find them? The dealership info has been incredibly unhelpful. I've tried googling and reaching out to a few companies (including SPL) but most seem like they do this testing on a much larger scale and commercially. 

Any help anyone can provide I'd be incredibly grateful for. ",1,1755014420.0,5,AskMechanics,1755113715,2025-08-12 16:00:20,2025-08-13 19:35:15,"sexandliquor (Score: 1): Maybe reach out to Blackstone

Three days ago, I went to turn on the car (it's a push to start) and the car wouldn't turn over. All of the lights came on in the car and on the dash, but the engine did not start. 

(Backstory)
I had some electrical work done about a year ago. Long story short, I was driving down the highway, all of the gauges on the dash started going up and down sporadically, and the radio would shut off and then come back on. After Lucy did that a couple of times, she just shut off in the middle of the HW.  I had Lucy towed to the shop, and I was informed that there was an alternator issue and an electrical issue. I got it fixed and have been driving her since just fine. Until 3 days ago she wouldn't start. 

Three days ago, first time that Lucy didn't start, I got a jump from a family member who had a jump box. Lucy immediately turned started after he put the jump box on the battery. I was able to drive the car today.

The following morning, Lucy did not start again. There was a person nearby he was able to jump. Again, I was able to drive Lucy the rest of the day, and I also went to O'Reilly's the same day to get a diagnostics and they said that my alternator is horrible and it needs to be replaced. After I left o'reilly's, I immediately went to Walmart and bought a ever Smart jump box. And I had it on the charger all night as instructed. 

The next morning, car will not start again. The jump box did not start the car. I even asked a man with a large F-150 to jump lucy. She still did not start. 

So my question is now.. if I leave the Dropbox on the battery all night charge it, do you think that my car will start the next morning? 

Does anyone know of a remedy I can do until I can go get my alternator fixed?

Car: 2010 Mazda 3, 2.5L factory 17"" alloy wheels

So, for the past year I've had front wheel (steering) vibration issues (at 55-75+).  It's been in and out of my local shop several times over the past year.  I've mentioned this every time.  During their investigations, they found (in order): 

1. A worn tie rod (replaced both inner and outer)
2. A Rear wheel bearing (replaced both)
3. A Front wheel bearing (replaced both)

I did all the work myself, and had them perform an alignment, and rotate the tires (at least 2x).  The problem remained.

The cycle changed when I got new tires and, had another shop (NTB) mount them (because my regular shop didn't carry the tires).  The shake persisted and when I took the car back to my local shop, they said the shake was due to a bent front passenger wheel.  

I had NTB swap out the wheel and the shake persisted.  I then swapped out my spare to the driver front, and poof the problem disappeared.  I had this wheel replaced, and voila no more steering shake, just a slight body (via floor) shake.  Looking at this old wheel, there is no obvious damage or, out of roundness.  I'd need a feeler gauge to find it.

  I rotated the rear tires to the front (they're directional) and poof, the steering shake is back.  I'm going to repeat the spare test (which is difficult due to the necessary speed).  To identify if it's both wheels or which one of them.

This whole time I've been operating under the premise that tire shops are properly balancing the tires and would've detected out of round conditions during the balancing.  However, after the most recent experiences I don't know what to think.  

It's pretty obvious to me now that it's been the wheels.  If this last test confirms this is true, what does this say about the shops?  Should they have been able to detect the wheels being out of round when balancing them?  Is this a matter of my local shop ignoring this problem in favor of more expensive repairs?

What are the odds that I would have three bent wheels with only one being detected by the shop?

1monnbm,Milwaukee v Seesii Impact Wrench,"I’m obviously not asking which is better, but which is worth it for me to get?

So I am currently interested in getting an impact wrench.

It’s a bit more than I want to spend, but I really want the Milwaukee mid torque 2962. 

But since I’m not going to be doing a ton of work on my car, I’ve looked at the Amazon brand Seesii, WH710. I know it is a big step down, but it is also much more affordable. And it comes with a charger, batteries, and sockets.

So… can you guys talk me in to one or the other of these?

Freekmagnet (Score: 1): If you are only going to work on your car doing basic things a couple times a year, you probably do not really need an impact wrench.    All an impact wrench does is make you able to work faster, which is important in a production shop where you are being paid to produce work quickly.   Everything you can do with an impact wrench you can do with hand tools.     You can actually generate \*more\* force to break loose rusted fasteners with a long breaker bar than an impact wrench can produce, especially electric ones.   In our shop  when an impact gun can't get something loose we switch to a large bar and sometimes a piece of pipe for an extension to get loose what the impact guns could not.   Hand tools will fit in tight spaces when doing things like changing brake calipers or remove=ing steering and suspension components, where a large electric impact wrench simply is not able to fit.  Also, when tightening fasteners you do not want to use an impact other than to snug the nuts down quickly because  you often need to measure torque, especially on wheel nuts, which requires finishing the tightening by hand anyways.

Something interesting I noticed over the years when taking on tech school co-op students in our shop is these new inexperienced techs would usually show up with a box full of big heavy brute force tools, like a large assortment of  bigger 1/2 inch drive sockets,  wrenches that fit diesel trucks, big impact guns- when in reality those types of tools are not used all that frequently in automotive.    Most of what we do on cars is with 1/4 and 3/8 inch drive tools, mostly below 19mm.    You will get far more use out of a good assortment  of 1/4 and 3/8  hand tools, including flex head ratchets, swivel sockets, Torx sockets, a good pry bar assortment, metric tap and die set, electric drill and bits, chisels and punch set, basic multimeter, and the like than you will out of a $500 impact gun unless you are being timed at the jobs you do and take dozens of wheels off and on all day long.

You may find that it would be better to invest in expanding your hand tool assortment or  buying a couple good quality torque wrenches, and save the impact  purchase for later when you find yourself doing more frequent jobs and really need it to speed you up..."

1moj63j,Servicing stop,"Sorry in advance for the length, but desperate for advice!

My mum booked her car in for a service with servicing stop & paid a fee of around £112 supposedly for the service. 

They picked it up yesterday morning and later on in the afternoon they called her saying the car needed new brake fluid (£180+VAT), lifetime fuel treatment and engine flush (£150+VAT), and long life oil (£32+VAT). Totalling almost £500. He told her this was required by Fiat for her warranty. (It’s a 2 year old Fiat)

My mum was confused because surely the price of a service should include break fluid + engine oil etc? But at the time she said I suppose it has to be done.

10 minutes later after talking to someone who had told her this was not normal, she called back and said please don’t do the work on my car, just bring it home. The guy said he wasn’t someone who could do that but he’d get someone to call back who could. My mum never got a call back, and spend the rest of the day trying non stop to contact them. She would just be waiting on hold for ages and then it would hang up. 

This morning and they’re still ignoring her so I call on my phone, to find out that all of the suggested work had been done last night, and she can’t have her car back until payment is made. 

Fast forward to this evening, my mum is desperate for her car back as she has appointments etc. She wasn’t even able to go to work today because she doesn’t have her car. So she called them, and after a very frustrating conversation with a very rude staff member and absolutely no budging, she begrudgingly opted for the option of paying in 4 instalments, and has made the first one. 

I’m just wondering if there’s absolutely anything we can do about this, she is not happy about having to pay this and I feel it’s very unfair. The staff at servicing stop were extremely dismissive. 

Any advice is appreciated, thank you! 

UPDATE: we got the car back today, bearing in mind the fuel was completely empty, down from almost full when they picked it up. 
We took it straight to the local reputable garage, who is checking it as we speak. He has called and said that none of the work that we were invoiced for has been done!

I got an Ionity monthly charging pass thing, it’s called Ionity Power now. It cost £10.50 and locks the charging fee to £0.43/kWh. Yes charging takes longer but as I have young kids and needed to stop frequently anyway. The time can be greatly reduced depending on the charging speed of the EV.

I actually asked Chat GPT do do a comparison for me and this is what I got :

“Here’s the math, using today’s UK average pump prices (petrol 134.39p/L, diesel 142.49p/L).  ￼

Trip length: 1,000 miles.

EV (3.5 mi/kWh): energy = 1,000 / 3.5 = 285.71 kWh.
Cost at Ionity = 285.71 × £0.43 + £10.50 = £133.36.
(If you treat the initial 57 kWh “free” because you start full, paid energy = 228.71 kWh, so £108.85.)

Petrol hybrid (50 mpg, UK): fuel = (1,000 / 50) × 4.54609 = 90.92 L.
Cost = 90.92 × £1.3439 = £122.19.  ￼

Diesel (60 mpg, UK): fuel = (1,000 / 60) × 4.54609 = 75.77 L.
Cost = 75.77 × £1.4249 = £107.96.  ￼

Note on “starts full”: for a like‑for‑like comparison you normally cost the energy you’ll consume during the trip (you’ll refill it afterward). If you want to credit the EV’s initial full battery but not the others (tank sizes unknown), use the lower EV figure above.”

So yeah, massively reduced daily running costs, long trip costs almost on par with diesel if you have some sort of charging plan. If you don’t mind the frequent charging stops which i am guessing you won’t because you have a you g family then EV is the cheapest total cost.

Spiritual_Pound_6848 (Score: 2): The range thing is less of an issue than you think. Did you stop at all during those 600 miles, for a driving break, for a coffee, to use the loo etc? Well then you'd just make sure you charge up at a rapid charger during that stop. If you only do this journey once or twice a year (or even less) why buy a car based on what you do 1% of the time. Have a look at the journeys you've done in the last month (exluding the 600m trip) and the ones you're going to do in the next month, thats what 99% of your driving will look like, buy a car to suit that. The best way to think of EVs is that they suit 'most people, most of the time'. Yes they might need a bit of topping up for a bit longer on those odd, once a year trips doing massive distances, but they work most of the time. 

if you have your own property, and an off street parking, it will be well worth getting a 7kw charger installed so you can charge from empty to 80-100% overnight while you sleep. 

Personally wouldn't bother looking at PHEV, either commit to ICE or EV don't half ass it.

Well it sure as hell isn't PCP. Paying up to £4800 a year (factoring in your deposit) for a car that you won't even own at the end of the 4 year deal just to do 6000-8000 miles a year is absolutely asinine.

Use the £3000 you currently have to buy a car outright. Save the £350 a month you would have made in monthly payments. 12 months time sell the £3000 car, add the £4100 plus interest you've saved, buy a £6000-£7000 car. Do the same again. 12 months sell that car, add the £4100 plus interest you've saved, buy a £10,000 car. Do the same again, buy a £14000 car.  Rinse and repeat and by year 4, the end of the PCP deal you were looking at you're going to be able to buy an £18k car in cash and actually have something to show for your money instead of the nothing you would have had with your current plan. Rinse and repeat another couple of years and you'll be able to buy a brand new car in cash.

I'm on maternity leave and it's cheaper to refurb the engine than get a new car, especially as I just bought it secondhand and have had quite a bit of work done to it. I went with them because of proximity and they were quick to answer and arrange pick up of vehicle.

They said they'd give photos, updates etc., and they haven't. I've had to chase for any communication. Still have no photos and it's been 2 weeks, so don't even know if the car's there. I have this sickening feeling my car's been stolen or stripped. 

The bloke is answering the phone, but isn't providing any reassurance. On the phone he asked why I was so worried about it, and I just felt so stupid saying you haven't provided what you said, especially for such a cheap car. He's also said I can go to the garage, but on public transport it would take me 2 hours and I have a 7 month old so it's not possible. My partner has said to look on Reddit for help.

I've been looking into them, and they're registered as a company, but it doesn't look like they're where they say they are on Google maps and they have so few reviews. The phone number on Google hasn't answered (I haven't left a voicemail), there's a generic email and no website, or at least it doesn't work on my phone.

\- At this point I just kept an eye on the car again, in terms of oil level etc, but the engine light came back  
\- I took it back to the dealer, they said I shouldn't let the fuel go too low, I did let the fuel go too low at some point and from what they described I assumed it was because of that.  
\- The error code was from cylinder 1 misfiring, so they swapped that cylinder with number 4 and asked me to keep an eye on it and come back if the engine light comes on again. They also did an oil change and filter at this point.  
\- 2 months have passed and I get oil level warning light, oil was at a minimum, I call skoda breakdown and the AA mechanic tells me, yep engine is probably burning oil, they need to look at your engine something is not right.  
\- I go back to the dealer with the car and they say ""no errors found"" and ""it's normal for cars with this mileage and age to burn through oil like this initially, drive another 1,000 miles and keep checking the oil, come back if it's still burning""

I’m aware that insurance for new drivers is generally pretty expensive, as a 34(m) will that afford me better rates than a younger driver or would age be irrelevant?

Is it recommended to lease through a local dealer or are online retailers like AutoTrader generally reliable? And if I were to lease via an online retailer, would they deliver to my local dealer?

That_Northern_bloke (Score: 8): Diesel should be fine for that, decent enough motorway stretches to get the DPF regen going 

Neither_Set_3048 (Score: 7): The newer post 2012ish diesels are a bit more complex. They do two types of dpf regen. Once is passive which happens on long journeys as the exhaust gets hot. 

The other is active regen, which is when the cars computer tells it to clean the dpf. All manufacturers have a slightly different system and set of criteria for it to take place. Some turn on additional things like the demister (Vauxhall) but they all generally dump diesel into the system to make everything get much hotter. If you interrupt this process, by getting to your destination the extra diesel is dumped into your engine. If this happens over and over again the engine fucks itself.

The problem is the car doesn’t light up and say, I’m doing an active regen don’t turn the car off. So you need to learn the signs of your car doing one so you don’t turn it off. The next problem, is that your car isn’t very clever, so it doesn’t know that you have just driven into your street or office car park and not to start a regen. So if you do a couple of short journeys there is a chance it will do it then or even when you just get home from a long journey. The next problem is that they all have slightly different parameters. None of them will do a regen if there is any sort of error message in the cars computer in case they damage the engine, potentially even if your error message is your rear bulb is out. Some also won’t do regens if you have a low fuel level. 

The next issue is all the other modern eco systems bolted on to the diesel engines are also temperamental. Be prepared for diesel injectors to only last 70k miles and likely cost from £700-1500 each. Your engine will have at least 4. Carbon build up and the various sensors don’t last long and start to give up after 5-7 years.

Diesels are fantastic when they work, but the modern ones for me have been too much of an expensive liability. If you are in anyone borderline between a petrol and diesel, go for the petrol.

How much will you save in fuel running a diesel vs how much will be wiped out by 1 diesel injector vs a spark plug."

I was originally looking at 320d bimmers, because I mean look at them, they're gorgeous and fun. But the other wolf in me said I'm not experienced enough for RWD and high maintenance costs. I've looked at old Mazda6's, manual to keep the practice up and build habits. For more money I was tempted by the 2019 facelift, but again it's probably a dumb idea as a new driver. It is cool though. I also looked at the mazda3's, which looks to be a similar experience and I don't really need the extra length, just presumed it would be smoother in the commute (right?). Also looked at the lexus is300h because of their indestructible reputation, but they are auto cvt so I'm not sure if I'd lose my window to gain manual driving ability. 

Brain Vs. heart situation, heart is German cars and brain is reliable Japanese, now I'm completely torn. Part of me says I deserve it (wanky I know) because I'm always frugal and work hard, and frankly have had the worst year of my life grieving my dad. But also he probably doesn't want me to wrap myself round a tree.

Open to any other suggestions, it's weird not having any parental figures to ask these things, so thank you in advance metaphorical internet dad.

Newer BMW are fine in bad weather, there's lots of electronics now to manage anything tricky that arises from a wet road. Older ones dont have this and its a learning experience. I had a 90s 3 series that used to routinely go sideways around roundabouts in the snow if you didn't crawl round it. 
Someone else mentioned servicing and this is right, unless you've got a good independent specialist to use, it'll be expensive at a dealer (and they are crap anyway) 

For a 1st car, dont spend too much. You may well have a bump in your 1st year, and the more expensive the car, the more upset you'll be. Maybe have a look at insurance for you on Audi vs VW. You can get reg numbers to quote from pics on ebay. 
You could spend £5k on a nice Polo if you want something really easy to drive?

Just did my ""sealed for life"" Audi gearbox a couple of weeks ago. Strangely this ""sealed for life"" gearbox has a drain plug, a fill plug and a ""fill to"" plug.

And I found the official Audi workbook on how to change the oil.

I'm not saying your gearbox will have all three plugs but while the manufacturer might well think the oil will last the life of the car, they simply can't test it for 10, 15, 20+ years. And lots of enthusiasts either find issues with not changing the oil or maybe simply it functions better after an oil change. The earlier revision of my gearbox did not have a ""fill to"" plug so it wasn't straight forward to change/they didn't design it in mind but the workshop instructions still document the process.

1mo2m2u,I'm looking for my new vehicle,"Heya all, after a nightmare 3 years with my van which was costing me thousands each year I have sold it and moved on.
I am now starting to think about what vehicle I want next. 
I have been eyeing up estates as I need a decent boot for our large dog (in the future we may have 2) and all the activities me and my partner do. 
I'm currently looking at a Toyota auris/ Corolla hybrid. 
My Budget is around 7k however I'm wondering if I'd be better of waiting it out and stretching it to £10/11k for something newer and lower miles to avoid repairs fees (paying higher repayments rather than garage fees). For example a 2019 Corolla as opposed to a 2014 auris. 

The car will be mostly used for trips 30-60 mins and not for commuting. And will a few times a year get used for longer trips (Devon to Scotland/ Devon to Wales).

Iv had terrible luck on cars for most of the time I have ever owned one so some advice would be amazing and much appreciated 🥺.
Really when it comes down to it we want: 
- Less than £30 on tax 
- Reliability and affordable parts (and a car which doesn't need dissembling each time to fix)
- fuel efficiency 

Thanks everyone.

txe4 (Score: 1): ""Less than £30 tax"" is not a sensible goal. You're paying say £2000 depreciation per year and who knows how much fuel and insurance; ruling out £200 tax cars is not a big increase in motoring costs.

A new Corolla TS is £32k. If you keep it 15 years and then it's worth nothing, that's £2k per year depreciation. Repair costs will come towards the end of its life; OTOH you may find after 15y it's still worth something. So: £2k per year.

Looked at like that, £5k more for a 5 years newer car seems sensible?

I've not actually looked at the second hand market to see whether the numbers you give are realistic.

IMV though, the more you go down the bottom of the market, the more a little bit of extra money gets you a lot more. At the bottom end of the market you are competing with people who can afford ""£X and NOT A PENNY MORE"".

Note that if you go for a <10y old one, you can keep the warranty to 10y/100k miles if you service with Toyota. The ""major"" service cost will make you wince a bit though.

1mo22l5,Replacing the AC condenser on my 2006 Honda Accord.,"My Honda dealership quoted my £320 labour only to replace my condenser (me to supply) and I can’t really justify that since I only need cold AC for about a month a year…..so I came up with the bright idea to replace the condenser myself.

My plan is to have the refrigerant professionally removed, I then replace the condenser myself with new o-rings, and I’ve also learned that I’ll need to put some Pag Oil in the condenser before reinstalling (and I can do that) before getting the system refilled with refrigerant professionally.

My question is…..

Would it be a bad idea to get the refrigerant removed now (August 2025), which is at least 8 months before I’ll get around to doing the job (say May 2026)?

I know the system has a leak anyway (hence the new condenser) so it might actually be empty of refrigerant anyway (and if it is, does that mean it could be rusting internally?).
