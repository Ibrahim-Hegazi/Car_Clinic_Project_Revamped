1muzeiv,every mechanic says they can’t find 2,"Hey everyone, I’m hoping someone here has seen this before because I’m losing my mind.
this ia the second video.

Car: 2004 Honda Accord (automatic)

Symptoms:
- Whenever I press the accelerator, I hear a high-pitched whirring noise (almost like an EV motor) coming from the back near the battery area.
- The sound isn’t occasional — it happens every time I accelerate.
- When idling, everything sounds fine. No noise at all.
- Recently, while driving on the highway and pressing the gas hard, the RPM suddenly spiked and it felt like the transmission dropped into a lower gear by itself. I had to pull over and ended up getting the car towed.

What’s frustrating is I’ve taken it to a few local mechanics already, and every single one told me they couldn’t find the source of the problem. Some basically gave up on diagnosing it.

Has anyone experienced something similar with an Accord (or other cars)? Could this be transmission related, alternator, bearings, or something else electrical/mechanical?

Any advice or pointers would be greatly appreciated.",1,1755647977.0,4,MechanicAdvice,1755718486,2025-08-19 23:59:37,2025-08-20 19:34:46,"Ok-Purchase-3939 (Score: 1): sounds like your transmission whining. check fluid level and condition.

that is how automatic transmissions work, they go into lower gears under hard acceleration

If its fluid, top it off.

Also turn tour wheels and inspect all components visually.

1muz2mu,"Car has been sitting awhile, need to get it running","Have an older car with a 327 Chevy SB motor. Been sitting in a farily climate controlled garage, that doesn't get too hot or cold, for about 4-5 years. It's basiacally been indoors with a cover on it. Issue is that it has a leakly gasket between the fuel tank and filler neck that I need to get replaced, and take it to a mechanic. It's only leaky enough to let fumes out, not spilling gas or anything. Before I add gas and fire it up to take it to a mechanic for this repair, I was wondering if I should do anything to get it ready for the first fire up in several years. The battery is good enough, or will get a new one.

Question is how concerned should I be about the motor and the cylinders. Since it hasn't been ran in awhile, was thinking I should pull the plugs and check that they are clear and not full of water, or something, maybe check with a bore cam that they aren't full of r\_ust. Perhaps get it out of the garage and do an oil change in the driveway before drivign it anywhere, in case something is leaking into the engine, that would tell me something before I drive it 10+ miles to a shop. Any suggestions are welcome. 

This was a car me and my late father had, and after he passed I have let it sit, deciding what I want to do with it. I am failry capable with cars, but not sure I want to drop a gas tank and replace this part myself. Someone told me the fix is basically a 50 cent cork gasket.

Then I leave my car idle for 30 minutes while I go in the store and my mom's in the car with the AC on. I get back to the car and the coolant is boiling. I gave it a second to cool and i put more coolant in and kept driving. Then I pulled over cause under my hood is smoking and I see coolant spraying out my resevoir and boiling itself. I replaced the radiator cap the air filter and put more coolant. At that point the coolant stopped boiling. About 5 days later I test drove it to my boyfriends house after letting it sit and all was fine but AC still warm while on cold. So i made it to his house and decided to turn the car on and off and i hear a whooshing sound and piles of coolant fall out the bottom of my car. I tried to start my car again and it struggles to start but it does start. So a week or so later I drive my car back to my mom's house and the hot and cold gauge in my car heated all the way to hot. Before it stayed in the middle. As I drove the gauge was going up as i pressed gas and slightly down as I let off but still slightly going up until it fully hit hot. I get home and take my thermostat out to test it and no coolant poured out when I took the thermostat out. My resevoir is full but under the radiator cap is empty.

With this said, a month has passed and the car is suddenly making a thumping sound \*INCONSISTENTLY\* over bumps and sometimes during turns. The obvious answer would be a CV axle but then why is it happening still while driving straight?

I can go 5 miles across town with no sounds but as soon as i come back to my neighborhood every bump, hump, and turn warrants all the clicks and bumps you could imagine. I'm at a loss. 

I checked every component today and EVERYTHING is tight. I literally have no clue.

He ended up ripping my passenger axle apart, where I warned him numerous times to be careful about it as I just replaced it 8 months ago. Nevertheless, he pulled it apart, but we were able to put it and the boot back together. We lost a decent amount of grease however.

So my question really, is it this CV axle or something else? It makes the sound CONSTANTLY even going straight. Shocks? If so what?

This is a clutchless AC compressor, it does not have a clutch to engage the compressor when powered up. It's going to spin continuously, and the activation happens internally.

If you notice the very center portion, the slightly rusted piece of metal, you'll notice that it does not spin with the rest of the compressor. This most likely means that the compressor has locked up, and the breakaway element has activated to allow the engine to continue running.

This will require a complete AC system replacement along with flushing the lines, If the compressor is truly locked up.

As for the windows and locks it's possible there's a break in the driver's door switch ground. I don't have access to wiring diagrams until tomorrow but often all the switches will run through that one as it's the master switch and commonly the wire will get brittle and break in the rubber sleeve that bridges the gap between body and door.

Edited to add: check if the brake lights turn on when you press the brake pedal. It won't shift out of park if the brake pedal switch has gone bad for any reason. If this is the case there's a shift release bypass."

Everything else except for the engine turns on when the key is turned. 

The Alternator is two months old.

I just replace the starter thinking that was the problem. No change.

I switched the starter relay with another of the same relay in the panel to see if that would work and no change

I checked all the fuses related to the starter and they all seem fine.

The voltage on the battery is 12.51vdc

I am not sure what to check next.

Pulled into a lot and saw that the driver side from wheel stud broke and the rest were completely loose I could spin them with my hand. I got my lug nut wrench out and tightened them back up and broke another stud with minimal effort. I was able to limp home. I re-torqued the front and they torqued fine. 150ft-lb. I checked my others by cracking a few loose and re torquing and they all checked fine and torqued good. I was able to find the broken stud and lug nut that fell off.

I rotated my wheels 800 miles before and 200 miles before it was at the dealership for a TSB and a recall. While it was there I asked that they do not rotate my wheels or do any service work outside of the TSB and recall. They had it three days and did a multi-point inspection. They stated they did not touch anything with the wheels. But Im sure they did with the multi-point inspection. I have a 1/2in tekton torque wrench that is two years old and only used for my trucks lug nuts. Ive never had anything like this happen before, ever, with all my lugs being loose. Im thinking if it was my fault that I didnt torque them down correctly id suspect that the lug nuts would have loosened faster than 800miles. And I wouldnt expect them to have broke like they did. I normally torque my lugs 2ft lb under the spec just for variation and if I tend to go a bit to far.

You stated that 1 tire raises to 42 psi after driving. What are the other pressures at that time? Assuming that you’re setting them to the same pressure when cold, if you have one tire where the pressure is raising significantly more than the others, then it potentially means that that tire is heating up more than the others, and the most likely cause for that is excessive friction causing heat build up.

I'm as far as you get from a car person, so it's funny that I own a BMW. However, maintaining this has been hell. I pay for the most expensive gas and can pretty much only get maintenance done at a BMW dealership which costs a ton.

I get things like oil changes done at local mechanic shops, but anytime I have something bigger like my battery going out, spark plugs needing to be replaced, etc, they always tell me that they don't have the right tools or replacement parts needed for BMWs.

Today I went to the dealership because my check engine light was on, and I got quoted $1100 to replace my rear brakes (they measured at 4mm), $255 for brake fluid (this one I know I can get done somewhere else for cheaper), $560 to replace my engine drive belt since it's cracking, and $1113 for my broken parking brake cable bracket. They also said my tires may need to be replaced soon.

Even if I just addressed the safety concerns of the brake pads, I would still be paying $1100. Every time I go to BMW to get maintenance done, which is about once a year, I'm told I need to pay $1000+. Not including my oil, tire rotations, and brake fluid - I go somewhere cheaper for those.

Instead of paying for any of the maintenance, I got an appraisal, and they gave me a $7000 quote. I'm not sure if this is a fair quote, but I have some minor damage on the outside in a few spots from over the years (a friend backed into me and I've tapped a few poles while parking). There's also a pebble stuck in my windshield, making a tiny crack that's been there for like 2 years.

I'm trying to figure out what to do from here:

* I could get the bare minimum maintenance from BMW and keep driving the car as long as possible.
* I could try to find other places to maintain my car: however this often ends up being a waste of time. I'm also very ignorant of cars, so I also never know when I'm getting scammed or not when I go to local places (bmw's maintenance prices are a scam as well I know)
* I could sell the car for $7000 and put that towards another car. However, I have no idea how much cars cost and don't know where to even start with the research. I hear Toyotas are nice and easy to maintain and I'm cool with something used, but I don't want to keep playing the car maintenance game.
* I could get another quote for my car if I'm being low-balled.

I have some cash I could put down for a car, but I just graduated from college and started my first full-time job so I'm not quite rolling in the dough yet. Also, my car insurance is $651/6months but I'm worried if I get a newer car that may shoot up.

It's interesting to observe that SUVs have antennas mounted like cars, even though they are not typically used as work trucks but more like oversized cars, haha.

I’m in a situation that I feel stuck in. I could really use some advice, probably more directed at car sales and financing. 

Over three years ago on Memorial Day weekend, I was T-boned by a pick up truck , which resulted in my car being totaled. 

I don’t know if everyone remembers, but three years ago was when there was a severe computer chip shortage, which resulted in no new cars on ANY lots and used cars were hiked up in price, even exceeding the normal price of a new vehicle. 

Anytime I would go to a dealership looking for a new car, they would have to put it on back order, for months, and obviously that wouldn’t work for me because I relied on my car to get to and from work, among other things.

After two months of searching, I finally found a used vehicle that wasn’t severely overpriced, but of course it still was a bit, and I had run out of time with my rental, which had already been extended to 60 days from 30, given the circumstances of the market. So long story short, I had to settle.

I hate this car.

At first, I thought it was at least a little cute, but in the past three years, I have had nothing but problem after problem and it’s literally driving me insane. 

This is now the third summer I’ve had this car and the third summer in a row that my AC stopped working. Last year I had a brand new compressor installed, which of course is expensive, and now it seems my fan is out, so I literally have no airflow in my car. And I live in Texas and it is now entering the hottest time of the year and I just can’t stand it anymore.

My payoff balance if I were to pay in full as of right now is $8085.

Last year when I considered trading it in, I still owed over $10,000 and was only being offered $2000 at trade-in, which I’m sure have decreased again.

Is there anyone out there that can recommend options of how I might be able to get out of this?

If I was offered the same trade-in amount of $2000 I’d be willing to carry over the $6000 balance because at this point I’ve put in more money in this car on repairs then I care to admit.

I’m just absolutely miserable in this car, it’s hot, I have no air, last summer I had fans that I would plug into the cigarette lighter, which of course doesn’t work anymore either so that’s not an option for me this time.

I’m just at my wits end and I feel stuck and I don’t know how much longer I can deal with this.

Any help and advice would be greatly appreciated. I’m just desperate at this point.

you're going to have to go with a new vehicle that will have some sort of rebate program or something along those lines.  Or get a bank loan on the remaining balance if you sell the car.

If you trade it in, you'll still owe the balance on the loan versus whatever they'll give you for the car so your payment will also be high on the new car, and you'll be ""upside down"" in the new car for several years, as well.

1muoemb,Do i need a new Battery?,"I have a 2019 Kia Soul and around May/June I was having trouble starting my car. Like took me a good two/ three tries before the car would actually start.

1muwk32,Rebuilt 62TE Transmission Not Shifting,"I'm just wondering if anyone can shed some light on this situation.  The transmission (62TE) failed on my 2014 RAM C/V (the C/V is essentially same drivetrain and chassis as the Dodge Caravan). I ordered a reman transmission off eBay, supposedly with all new mopar parts. The seller has outstanding feedback.  After my shop performed the transmission swap, it wouldn't shift out of first gear and threw a code P0781.  

Seller was notified of the problem, and after discussing with my mechanic it was determined that the solenoid was potentially defective. Seller overnighted a new solenoid block to my repair shop and agreed to cover the labor for the solenoid swap.  Unfortunately, this did not fix the issue.  There are now 4 codes, P0736, P0731, P0732, and P0792.  I should mention that my mechanic took the car to a transmission shop to ensure it was properly programmed / relearned after the original trans swap as well as after the solenoid swap. My mechanic insists the trans was properly programmed and relearned so he doesn't know what else it could be other than a faulty rebuilt trans. 

Seller and my mechanic discussed options, seller offered to replace the trans with another one. Here is what the seller messaged me after discussing further with my mechanic:

*""We spoke with the shop, after the solenoid block replacement (new from Mopar) there are now four codes P0736, P0731, P0732, and P0792, all pointing to the solenoid block and they set after a short drive. Physical symptom is identical to before the block replacement, it does not go into any high gears at all. Both the codes and the symptoms point to the programming and relearn process not being done but we triple checked with the shop that the programming is completed. Only option left at this point is to get a replacement unit sent or a refund process, depending on your preference. Due to the symptoms there is a chance the replacement unit will do the same thing as we suspect the cause is external but there is no way to be sure at the moment.""*

The ball is now in my court. ,Would it be wise to get a second look, as far as the programming /relearn process before I decide to just send it back for a refund? Or maybe take up the seller's offer to accept a full replacement trans?

Coyote_Tex (Score: 1): What were the codes you had with your previous trans and what was it's failure?  I would suggest you do give some consideration to the potential that your shop or his transmission guy are doing something wrong as well.  There are a lot of potential options and having new parts supposedly dealer parts fail is not a high possibility and getting more codes after starting with one, is concerning.

When I look up the current codes you are seeing it is showing me codes that might be related to internal transmission issues, but the fact you have more codes than you started kind of suggests to me that you might well have wiring issues to the new transmission that might have been the original issue as well.  The reason you have more codes now might be they messed with the wiring harness more after replacing the solenoid on the rebuilt transmission.  The codes are speed sensor codes for reverse and first gear which are transmitted to the computer through the wiring harness.  Having 2 different gears with speed sensor issues often means there is insufficient fluid, incorrect fluid, and internal transmission issue like a bad pump etc or bad solenoids, or an external wiring issue which would be a common point of failure between these two speed sensor readings.  Likely the same sensor in 2 different gears, reverse and first.  

So, I would suggest someone good with the electrical connections outside the transmission.  Your current group of techs might not be the best ones to do this as it might show they misdiagnosed the issue to begin with.   My perspective on the transmission rebuilder is to give them some benefit of the doubt here as the mechanical parts of the transmission are fairly easy normal rebuild steps and if they are using new factory electrical components they are further improving their odds of having a perfect rebuild when done.  Experience rebuilders can do the mechanical components in their sleep and rarely make mistakes.  I also assume the speed sensor is new and transmitting correctly.  Thus, that takes me right back to the wiring harnes which can be old, have corroded or broken wires or be burned and oil soaked causing issues.  

I would thoroughly run down all possibilities of this being an electrical issue between the transmission and computer before moving further.  IF the external electrical issues are perfect, then I might see if I could back out of this transaction and get my tranny fixed locally. The reason being what if the next one fails the same way?

I know if I rebuilt the transmission in this same way, I would be suspecting something else at this point.  Just looking at the odds of these new parts failing makes me want to look somewhere else.  I will also tell you Pentastar products have a reputation for wiring issues,..."

Recently, she took it in to get it fixed because there was a leak in her transmission and there was also some arm or something needing fixed for one of the wheels. In total, it cost $1070.

She got the car back. Later that day, it completely shuts down on her as she is pulling it into the driveway. It's maybe been driven for a total of 30-45 minutes at this point since getting it back from the dealership. The steering wheel and brake both lock up on her, the gas stops working, and the check engine light comes on. She also couldn't change gears (because again, the brake was locked up). She turned off her car, turned it back on, did that a couple of times and it started working again and check engine light is no longer on.

She took it back to the repair shop the next day, they couldn't find a problem.

The day after, she leaves with it, goes a couple blocks down the road, happens again. Locks up. She gets it towed to the repair shop (it's just down the road from us)

They ask her some questions about it. One thing the guy asks is if she has ever replaced any sensors on it. She says yes, herself, but that was a long time ago and it's been fine.

Guy asked where she got the sensors from. She said AutoZone. He said yeah, we have a policy that if we ever need a part that requires electricity to run through it, we never go to AutoZone because their parts break down after a couple of years. And the guy swears whatever they did to fix her car before wouldn't be causing this new issue (mind you, they don't actually know what's causing this new issue yet)

I later told her she probably shouldn't have told him she has done anything with the vehicle, herself. Because if they did screw something up, they might try to make that the reason why this was happening, instead of fixing the problem they made and that they wouldn't even need that info from her to figure it out. If they had a suspicion it was a sensor, they could do their own diagnosis on it and find out if it was the problem, without additional info from her.

Then we leave, she gets a call from them a couple hours later, turns out the issue was a sensor, costing another $280. I forget what sensor she said it was, I texted and asked her so will update this post when I find out.

But to my actual question. I'm never one to rule out coincidences, but I also know very little about car repairs. And for her car to have this other issue within an hour of receiving it back, an issue it wasn't having prior, is just weird to me.

And I'm not even wondering if it was something done intentional to get more business, although not completely ruling that out either because I've heard some horror stories in the past.

- Around Monday, I turned on the car and drove about 100 yards before the battery and oil lights came on. Car gradually slowed to a stop. I got a battery jump and it ran again. Checked the oil and it was at half capacity so I refilled. Car ran normally from there but AC stopped working.
- Driving on the highway a few days later and engine light flashed for about 10 seconds, then light stopped. Car ran normally during and after.
- Brought car in for AC repair over the weekend. They charged me $450, flushed and refilled the refrigerant, did a diagnostic, and told me I need a new compressor and condenser along with a laundry list of other preventive items. Mechanic kindly told me I’d be better off buying a new car.
- Today, went to start my car and all lights came on along with a clicking noise and a flashing engine light. Car will not start.

- My armchair reddit research makes it seem like it could be that the refrigerant was overfilled, and that maybe broke the compressor and condenser and alternator. Does that seem accurate, or could there be something else at play?

Hello everyone, I would like to ask if anyone ever hard experience with broken bolts on M57N2 (M57D30TU2) on my bmw e90 330d 2005
Last year I had to change my head gasket and when I was screwing off the rocker cover from the vacuum pump bolts (you can see them on the image) they broke off when i was unscrewing the bolts that were mounted on top of them from the cover. I found the OEM of them and got new ones, but I never did remove the broken bolt from the car so it got messed up, but then I learned about center punch etc., but I think after many tries the little parts of drill bits got melted and it hardened even more.. and right now I can't unscrew them off in anyway once I also got successful to drill hole inside one of them, but when I try to get it out using reverse bits they broke.. even the thickest ones... I tried the carbide bits and other high grade drill bits which are supposed to be really hard, but nothing. Even my center punch got dulled from those. I know there are also some extra hard bits meant for CNC machining one cost around 18€ approximately, but I don't know if they'd help...

So If anyone got same/similar issue in the past or has experience when it comes to ,,stuck stripped bolt'' I'd be glad for any kind of help

NOTE: If anyone wanted to suggest to weld it, well, I don't have welding machine so gotta try something else + it’s next to timing chain covered in oil 🙂‍↔️

If you disconnect the battery , then jump it (using a multimeter will accomplish this), the modules wake up, and need time to go back to sleep. Once they are “asleep” is time to check your reading. Depends on manuf but 10-30 mins

Better way to test it is using a clamp on AC/DC ammeter. Open the hood, lock the car, make sure everything is off (including hood light). Come back a half hour later and take your reading. Rule of thumb is 50mA max, but newer cars could be a bit higher.

I found the OEM of them and got new ones, but I never did remove the broken bolt from the car so it got messed up, but then I learned about center punch etc., but I think after many tries the little parts of drill bits got melted and it hardened even more.. and right now I can't unscrew them off in anyway once I also got successful to drill hole inside one of them, but when I try to get it out using reverse bits they broke.. even the thickest ones... I tried the carbide bits and other high grade drill bits which are supposed to be really hard, but nothing. Even my center punch got dulled from those. I know there are also some extra hard bits meant for CNC machining one cost around 18€ approximately, but I don't know if they'd help...

My windshield wipers get stuck on the interval setting. By that, I don't mean they stutter or jump. They will start to raise then immediately stop/pause, a couple seconds pass, and they become unstuck and go back to normal. It's like they're skipping a full wiping ""cycle"". I hope this makes sense. 

This happens completely randomly and only happens on the interval setting where you adjust the specific speed from slow to fast in increments. So it doesn't happen when activating the windshield wiper fluid (Mist) or in regular Low or High settings.

1mup0qp,2024 Toyota Grand Highlander  Highlander - alignment woes,"Edit: Meant “2024 Toyota Grand Highlander Hybrid” in the tittle. 35k miles. 

Hello, my wife has a 2024 Grand Highlander that she recently had new tires put on after putting 35k miles on it from factory. During the tire replacement at this tire store, she was told she needed an alignment done. Makes sense. 

Well today she went to one of their sister stores for the alignment and was told they couldn’t do it there, because their machine was broken. So she went to the other other sister stores. There, the tire store told her there was damage to her car, like it’d gone “off a jump” and that they would need to replace the camber arms in the rear because they were bent. 

When asked if they could show her, they could not. So I advised her to have them take the car off the lift and give another opinion. Suddenly they could show her the damage and explained it could be from hauling heavy loads. But in the meantime they would just “bend them back” till she went back to Toyota for her 35k service the next day. They did quote her $2,050 to replace the camber arms. 

Was this tire shop trying to scam my wife? I feel like they were trying to pull the wool over her eyes since she’s a woman. I also feel like they were grasping at straws talking about hauling heavy loads because she does have a trailer hitch that we use to pull a small trailer and bring her mobility scooter around on longer trips.

I just replaced basically the entire brake system myself (pads, rotors, calipers, didn't really want to spend almost 2k for a shop) before realizing that the problem was probably the master cylinder, as air still got into my brake lines after bleeding. 

I replaced the master cylinder (thought I bench bled enough) and bled the entire system again. After bleeding everything and seeing no air bubbles come out, the pedal is still super squishy and engages late, almost as if there's no assist.

Could it be the brake booster? My pedal hardens when I pump it with the car off but then sinks when I turn the car on. I also usually have a rough start and rough idle. RPM's go up and down/car lightly shakes and pedal sinks at red lights. Since the booster pulls vacuum from the intake, I'm wondering if it's all connected and that's the issue.

I was like ""Well that's weird."" And turned the AC off, tried to make sure I had it on the right settings. Then a minute later this message pops up ""Engine Overheated idle engine"" and that freaked me out so I turned off the car immediately and looked on Google to see how long to leave it off. So I waited 40 minutes and then drove the half mile home because I am 10 days before payday and on a fixed income and have 18 cents to my name.  

So I rushed home, luckily no overheating in that time. But now I'm stuck because I checked the coolant levels and it looks empty to me. I don't see any coolant (but who knows I'm ridiculously car illiterate) and Ifigure that means I have a leak somewhere. 

My Friend said he noticed a big brown puddle by my tires when he got out of the store. Never had that happen before.   

My cousin has two 1 gal containers of Shop Pro Extended Life Prediluted Antifreeze and Coolant. He was like just put that in you'll be fine. But I tried to explain sometimes you need specific types of coolant right for your car, I don't know where to pour it in, and if there's a freaking leak dude this won't help me. But he didn't want to hear it.

This will absolutely cause the car to overheat if you’re sitting there idling but the car would be fine when driving the whole way home. 

As far as the low coolant level, it’s possible that it did try to overheat and some of the coolant may have boiled over and vented from the reservoir making the level low and dropping some fluid on the ground from the coolant reservoir cap letting it vent. 

From what I can find online your car uses Dex-Cool coolant which can have a tendency to not play nice with other coolant blends. I’m not 100% sure what you have is compatible. Worst case, add some distilled water to top it off and you’ll be fine. Just make sure to have the proper coolant mixture added before you hit any freezing weather. It should take less than a gallon to top off. Any more and there may be an actual leak. 

Add some water to the full line on the reservoir, start the car, look underneath for any immediate leaks, then put the AC on full blast. (Note: it is normal for the AC to drip water, likely near the middle of the car but it’ll be pure, clear water). Once the AC is on take a peek in the engine bay and see if the fan is going. When the AC is on full, the fan should also be moving air pretty much full speed. If it’s not, there’s your issue. If it is, then something else may be wrong. 

And this likely had nothing to do with getting your oil changed, unless it was something they could’ve caught with an inspection (that basic oil change places probably won’t even do).

It's a relatively new battery from Mitsubishi themselves on a 2013 Triton. Engine was replaced by them. By the time they did that the battery was dead so was replaced.

But the corrosion just came back harder. Gave it a good clean down now with boiling water and alot of baking soda. But whilst I was cleaning the terminal, it developed holes in the sides. I have attached photos. Never seen this happen. Never had an issue with corrosion on a battery terminal like this. I put some Vaseline on the neg as recommended.

Those are two different statuses. If it's a salvage title, it means it sustained damage that the insurance company deemed too costly to fix. A salvage vehicle cannot be driven on public roads. If someone was to repair the damage and get it certified, it would convert to a rebuilt title and then be driveable on public roads. If it's rebuilt, go ahead.

I'm writing a script and I have a specific question and hope you can help me please?

I have a small rear engine car that's been modified and armour plated increasing the weight but has been stripped out of all other unnecessary weight inside the vehicle.

There's an average sized person lying on the hood that's added weight (maybe 150lbs)  
The front tyres have been shot and are deflated  
The ground is hard rock & light sand  
The vehicle can only move slowly due to the front flat tyres & weight

Q: If the driver drove forward at slow speed (5-10mph) and then engaged a NOS, could the vehicle move forward at greater speed over a distance of about 10-20 meters? If so, what speed would be believable?

Backstory:

I'm driving Dacia Sandero 2012, 1.2, previous owner has installed GPL after buying the car around 2012/13 , it was not manufactured with it.

Problem: 

I bought the car sometime last year, and now the switch button is making this beeping sound. Usually, this sound should only happen when I run out of GPL and it automaticly goes to gas, I just have to press it and it stops. Now the beeping sound is also when I have full tank of GPL, and it comes every other time I start the car. The beeping sound usually goes off when I was driving car, then turn it off (like to go to the store) and when I return to turn it on the beeping starts and both the light for GPL (yellow light), and light for gas ( orange light) blink. The only thing I have noticed to help is I have to turn off the car, wait for some time, sometimes 5mins, sometimer hours and  it runs perfectly on LPG.

I have tried manually pressing the button to put it on GPL, the beeping still the same, and when that happens I just manually press the button so that the car runs on gas and it stops beeping.

I have a feeling like the car is confused and flabbergasted with the concept of driving on GPL and it glitches and don't really knows what to do, even tho the car was driven on GPL for more than 10 years.

Also, the car got all his GPL inspections made in time, and I dont know should I go to mechanic or electrician or what?",1,1755595412.0,2,AskMechanics,1755718486,2025-08-19 09:23:32,2025-08-20 19:34:46,"HappyFlower3936 (Score: 1): It indicates an error code, low pressure ""aka"" empty tank also is a error code, hence the same beep.

Toyota Highlander 2006 hybrid engine overheating. What are all the possible problems? 

Overheating in a 2006 Toyota Highlander Hybrid can stem from various issues. Here are the potential problems that could lead to engine overheating:

## Possible Problems

### 1. **Coolant Issues**
   - **Low Coolant Level**: Insufficient coolant can lead to overheating. Check for leaks or evaporation.
   - **Coolant Leaks**: Leaks in hoses, the radiator, or the water pump can cause coolant loss.
   - **Contaminated Coolant**: Old or contaminated coolant can lose its effectiveness.

### 2. **Thermostat Failure**
   - A stuck thermostat can prevent coolant from circulating properly, leading to overheating.

### 3. **Water Pump Failure**
   - A malfunctioning water pump may not circulate coolant effectively, causing the engine to overheat.

### 4. **Radiator Problems**
   - **Clogged Radiator**: Dirt and debris can block the radiator, reducing its ability to dissipate heat.
   - **Damaged Radiator**: Physical damage can lead to leaks and reduced cooling efficiency.

### 5. **Cooling Fan Issues**
   - **Faulty Cooling Fan**: If the electric cooling fan isn’t working, it won’t cool the radiator effectively.
   - **Fan Relay or Fuse Problems**: A blown fuse or faulty relay can prevent the fan from operating.

### 6. **Head Gasket Failure**
   - A blown head gasket can allow coolant to leak into the engine, leading to overheating and potential engine damage.

### 7. **Engine Oil Issues**
   - Low or dirty engine oil can lead to increased friction and overheating.

### 8. **Hybrid System Issues**
   - Problems with the hybrid system, such as the inverter or battery cooling system, can also contribute to overheating.

### 9. **Blocked Hoses**
   - Kinks or blockages in the hoses can restrict coolant flow, leading to overheating.

### 10. **Exhaust System Blockage**
   - A blocked exhaust can cause excessive heat buildup in the engine.

### 11. **Sensor Malfunctions**
   - Faulty temperature sensors can give incorrect readings, leading to improper cooling system operation.

### 12. **Air in the Cooling System**
   - Air pockets can prevent proper coolant circulation, leading to localized overheating.

If your Highlander is experiencing overheating, it's essential to diagnose the issue promptly to prevent further damage. Consider consulting a professional mechanic for a thorough inspection and repair.

So I guess it will be a process of elimination from here. If anyone has any idea of what is more likely the problem from the list over the others, it would be great to know!"

I’ve been watching a few videos about remapping and they do make sense, and I understand the theory behind it, but I feel like I need that experience working with actual cars, where I can trial and error and learn from mistakes.

What should I do? Is it worth learning something that I’m not sure if I’m attracted to? What budget should I accredit for this? Where can I find tools that have a good quality:price ratio?

Looking forward to advice. Thanks.

PS: if anybody is wondering, I don’t currently have a driving license but I’m actively working on that.

I bought a 2015 Ford Focus 1.6L diesel with 80,000 miles on it from a car dealership last month (30th July) on HP.  I only just passed my test on the 9th of July and on my very first day with the car the clutch got stuck to the floor and I needed 3 guys to help push the car off the road into an open field.  One of the guys rang his mechanic, got the clutch quickly sorted but later told me the car is badly overheating.

I rang the dealer (who was on holiday) and his mechanic answered the phone, collected it, gave it back to me the day after claiming he had ""fixed it"" by adding ""fresh coolant"" and adding ""brake fluid"". My clutch still got stuck, and the coolant was still way below the minimum.

I had enough and went to an independent Ford dealer for a diagnostics test.  The results were as follows, both given to me via email and as a print out:

\- Vehicle requires rear discs and pads

\- New timing belt is due

\- Possible Head Gasket replacement

\- Possible new Slave Cylinder

I rang the dealer, as I'm under warranty with him, and he immediately got aggressive, telling me that people were talking crap, the ford dealer was manipulating me so I could buy one of their cars, how dare I question his mechanic, I held the car for you over two other potential buyers, you went behind my back and questioned me.

But, just for info, the clutch issue could be due to a bad slave cylinder, yes, and also explains why the mechanic has topped up the brake fluid - it's a linked/common hydraulic system so there is almost certainly a leak somewhere. And, loss of coolant could be due to a failed head gasket - open the engine oil fill cap (when cool), does it look like milkshake? The timing belt is a potential timebomb - albeit far less prevalent than the ford ecoboost petrol engines, it's definitely advisable to replace it at least after 10 years (now).

In short, the dealer sold you a duff car and he's trying to scare you into accepting it. He thinks you're easy to manipulate because you're young and inexperienced.
Don't put up with this. The fact that you have finance means you're in a very strong position - both against the finance provider and against the dealer.

1muq8uv,Is this car dealer trying to pull something shady with regards me buying a car on a private plate?,"Saw a car online, fairly big-ish dealer, 3 or 4 big sites.

Couldnt find any mot history as the plate wasnt recognised, but did find out it was on a private plate before viewing it. Still shown on HPI and DVLA attached to the private plate. They'd only had it in stock for about 3 or 4 days before I made my enquiry, after taking it in as a part-ex. 

The private plate is still attached to the car, but it had the old plates on when I looked at it. Put a deposit down with a view to collecting tomorrow. I queried the plate, he said he needed to speak to the salesman who took it in part-ex to make sure it was either being retained, or previous owner had traded it in and was happy to lose the plate.

He rings me today and says he's spoken to the previous owner who wants to retain the plate. This strikes me as odd, as they've had over a week to do that already.

He then said because the vehicle has ended it's tax, it's classed as a ""break in tax"" and as such the plate can't be retained online and must be done by the previous owner via post (which i've never heard of before and thought this was bollocks). I checked the private plate online and it's taxed until November. 

He offered me to take the car tomorrow with the private plate attached, then when it does get retained, he'll let me know and even give me the 'new plates' to stick on. 

I couldn't be bothered with this, plus the insurance admin charges of changing my car, then paying another admin charge to change the plate in the future. 

He said my other option was to wait about a week until the plate owner has done this postal retention, he'll let me know when that's done, then he can register the 'old' plates into my name and I can have the car.

I said i'd do that, he said he'd keep an eye on it and let me know asap.

Upon reflection, this whole thing sounds like a lot of bollocks and I can't figure out what he's trying to pull. Surely phone the old customer, tell them they've got 24 hours to do an online retention or he's selling the car to me and they lose their plate. 

The car didn't need any work, mot etc so I don't think he's stalling to hide mechanical repairs or anything.

Your issue is the postal service can take up to 6 weeks from application, but typically will take 2 to 4. The dealer is telling you a week because they don't want to lose the sale. Once you've driven away they will just keep putting you off about the new V5 until they get it and sort it all out.

Either get the work done and keep your car running a while longer... or ask them to buy the car off you and use the money for another car.

Since it already has a new clutch, I'd probably just get the work done and pay for it.

1mumx87,Speeding ticket scam or legit?,"Hello all, just asking for some advice. 

My mother has received a letter in the post claiming that she was speeding doing 91 mph in a 70 mph dual carriageway in Stevenage. 

She was not driving at this time because she has a receipt proving she was in Tesco at 14:57 where she’d been shopping for over an hour. The letter says the speeding took place at 14:54. My mum uses life 360 app and it does not show the car went for a joy ride or anything like that. Please see the attached photos but bear in mind all of it in red I have scribbled out for personal protection.   


The letter has no reference number and the picture of the car speeding is enlarged on a piece of A4 paper with a bullseye mark on it on a separate letter but was in the same envelope. The supposed date it took place has been typed down as 04/09/2025, which you can see has been scribbled out and written under as having taken place 10/08/2025.  We are very worried that my mum’s plate has been cloned onto another car or that this is a scam letter. 

Can someone please let me know based off the evidence I will give in this thread (the picture of the ticket etc) if this is a scam or a legit speeding ticket. 

She called the police station when they asked for a reference number she said “I don’t have one” so they asked for her Reg but nothing was coming up on the system.

A lot of people here are comparing the tickets they've had to the one OP had.

OP says it needs to be returned direct to the officer rather than the processing unit.

If it's a speed camera van, they take the data/images/video from the camera, download it then a computer processes the tickets.

OP has confirmed it's to be sent back to an officer who OP has confirmed is legit and does work there.

This is a bobby doing roadside speed enforcement and has knocked up their own S172 notice and copied/pasted the image into the 172 themselves, unlike the computer from the camera van which does it as part of a full download (which could be hundreds of tickets based on a days work). Like a lot of bobbies, they're a bit thick because it doesn't look professional and they couldn't be arsed printing another one so did a biro job on the date. The 41RPU on the photo somewhat confirms this, camera van operators are police staff civilians and won't use a RPU tag or title on anything they do (Road Policing Unit). It might vary from force to force but i'd be very surprised if they did.

It wont need a reference number because its not gone through the central ticket office. 

It's some bobby doing roadside work and then making half a job of doing a correct 172.

Doesnt disguise the fact that it's probably a cloned car, but that's another story altogether. Nothing would come up about the registration on the system when she rang up because comms operators don't have access to speed enforcement systems.

I bought a used car from a registered dealer 2 weeks ago, we spoke about fresh MOT and to fix the A/C, however on the invoice notes he has written ""MOT. A/C GAS"" which unfortunately I didn't notice until now.

The AC compressor is bust, so a re-gas lasts for around 5 days before it's all leaked out and stops working.

The car had rust underneath which I was aware of, and I had this professionally dealt with and undersealed last week, at this time the worker noticed 2x holes in the cars exhaust

I have since shown the holes to an exhaust specialist who says the holes will have been there for at least 6 months, and should NEVER have passed the MOT which the dealer put on the vehicle.

Quotes to fix AC - £825 (from a chain garage, I am awaiting a quote from local garage)

Quote to fix exhaust - £450

Should the dealer pay for exhaust repair as it was blatantly missed on the MOT, which was part of our sale deal?

Should the dealer pay for A/C compressor, as the verbal agreement of sale was functional A/C, but they have specified gas on the invoice notes.

We have another car in the household already that I am insured to drive also.

But I am a bit confused when it comes to insurance and unsure the best way to deal with it.
The existing insurance policy for our existing cars says there are two cars in the household.
When I buy the new car we will have 3 cars in the household for 1 week, until the old car is sold.

So the issues I have are as follows:

1. Do I need to phone the insurance company for the two existing cars and update them to having 3 cars now, then in 1 week phone and update to 2 cars again and cancelling one policy - each time incurring admin costs?

2. When getting insurance for the new car do I state there are 3 cars and then a week later phone up and change to 2 and again hitting admin fees?

1muhql0,Suggestions for a usable classic (pre-85),"I live in London and already have a family car, but occasionally it would be great to have a second car (it'll do about 2k a year). My thinking is that getting a 1985 or older classic is going to be a good way to go, no ULEZ, no tax, no MOT, low insurance, easier to work on.

The only slight issue is that it'll have to be parked on the road (safe enough but open to the elements). 

I'm currently thinking Mercedes SL (R107) or a Porsche 944.

If I went with the 944, I'd probably get a slightly later one (86/87) and just suck up the ULEZ charge for a couple of years as I believe there were changes in 85 that are worth having.

I do like the idea of the 944, they are still somewhat underrated but a great platform. If you want the braver option the 928 may be an interesting choice, bit of a halfway house between the 107 and 944, but you may also want to suck it up and get an S4 and pay ULEZ for a couple of years. 

Slightly out of budget but there’s a really interesting Sierra XR8 on the market at the moment (yes it’s a 1/250 factory V8 from South Africa). But you’ll need to go to Scotland for it. Definitely a left field car that will be an instant conversation starter for people in the know."

Any advice or tips? I have found a few good YouTube channels with good advice, but wanted to check in with you guys here to see if anyone had any secret sauce :)

I would like to get a new head unit with android auto and install cameras etc., and turn this into a super reliable daily driver / roadtrip car.

Oh, and as for time budgeting, everything takes longer the first time if you’re paying enough attention. It’s always easier to take things out than put them back so document things well; photos or videos of the process are your friends, as well as separating fastenings into “stages” (I use separate boxes for the radiator, alternator, etc.) so you don’t end up finding a bolt you should have fitted 2 hours ago that’s now covered by a heap of other things.

1mue2fz,Bought a Tesla Model S - issues,"Hi all,

I bought a 2017 Tesla Model S from a non Tesla dealer less than a month ago and since discovered a number of issues.

After purchase, I discovered the right wing mirror was not opening and that the motor was broken. After a bit of back and forth with the dealer they reluctantly agreed to fix the issue using a 3rd party mechanic - fine. What they refused to pay for however was the wheel alignment to correct the steering which I reluctantly accepted to pay myself. 

However, I have found that the car is still pulling to the left and so  booked it in with Tesla for them to identify the issue. Their inspection has confirmed that:

· The car is still pulling left

· Suspension check found 2 x aft links (play present) and 2 x fore links (split bushes on inner fixings) need replacing

· It also requires 2 x new ski rails (separate issue - only £50)

· Total cost of repairs and alignment: £1,432.86

Since the issue was there from the start and I have owned the car for less than 30 days, is it reasonable to assume that I shouldn’t pay for this? 

I believe I am covered under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 so have written to the dealer asking them to either cover the cost of repairs or give me a full refund if I return the
Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? Am I correct in thinking I can just reject the car outright, or should I push harder for them to cover repairs? 

Furthermore, am I within my rights to request that the repairs are carried out by a certified Tesla technician rather than a back street garage? 

Thank you

MyKidsFoundMyOldUser (Score: 0): How many miles does it have? That type of wear is consistent with a car that's been fairly battered by British roads.

I assume it has a recent MOT? All of the problems you talk about should have been noted on the MOT, as advisories at the very least.

Also, it sounds weird but check your tyres and pressures. Mismatched tyres and different pressures can cause pulling. If you have a Chinese ditch finder on one side and a Michelin on the other, you are going to have different rolling resistances.

Finally, you're buying a Tesla in 2025?"
1mudxag,I’m stuck choosing between a Kia Xceed and a VW T-Roc. Help!,"Hey guys.

We’re looking for something solid and reliable, nice to drive and with a bit of grunt. Space for 4 adults comfortably and a decent boot. Slightly higher driving position than something like a golf or a focus. EDIT: manual gearbox too (not into autos!)

We’re looking at a Kia Xceed 1.5 (trim level 3) vs a VW T Roc 1.5 Style. Both a similar age and with similar mileage (21/22 plate, <35k miles).

We’ve driven both cars and like both of them. I slightly prefer the Kia, my partner slightly prefers the T Roc but we’re both happy making a compromise. 

The Kias that match our spec seem to be around £16.5K. The T-Rocs are £19.6k.

When I viewed the car in person a few days ago, I really struggled to find anything wrong with it. It also has full service history.

The dealer gave me 3 months warranty, which includes bare engine (not ancillaries), transmission, driveshaft and axles.

After 15 minutes leaving the dealership these errors showed up on the dashboard. The dealer reassured me that they would take care of it and suggested to check the tyre pressure, because it could be the cause. He said that it was ok to drive home, I live 50 miles away.

After I restarted the car the errors disappeared and 50 minutes later showed up again.
I checked the tyre pressure at a petrol station near my home. The pressure was very low. The rear right one had a half of what it was supposed to be. The other tyres had 5-8 psi less than the norm.

After topping up the tyres, last night I drove around for about 1.5 hours nonstop, pushed the car more than I normally would, went over bumps, potholes, did a few emergency stops. No errors.

It certainly doesn't look good, this happening 15 minutes after the purchase. I feel let down and now worried that I bought a lemon.

Don’t worry about modifications, certainly nothing like a lift kit. We added a home-made sump guard and a roof rack but we were three up. I would definitely do the sump guard again to be fair. A few people were using van tyres as they’re thicker but we had normal ones, picked up two punctures along the way one of which was thoroughly avoidable. I think we had two spare wheels? Which probably was just excess weight in the end. The biggest thing is pack light, and I would wholeheartedly recommend bringing a dozen tennis balls to stuff into the rear suspension as the roads get rougher - that will help out much more than you would expect.

I’m surprised they can still run it given the state of things across the region, what is the route nowadays?!

* How easy would it be to add decent suspension?
   * No idea for your car but we went to a breakers and found a Ford Mondeo on its back.  We took the springs from the front of that car and put them onto the back of our Uno - they were too big so we had to cut about 1 turn (?) off each spring to get them to fit.  We then took our old rear springs and added them to our existing front springs, basically intertwining them.  Net result was the car was raised by 3-4 inches.  Empty, the ride was horrific - you felt every single little pebble you drove over.  Fully loaded, the ride was perfect.
* Are there any lift kits that we could adapt for the car?
   * No idea, but see above
* Could we mod a skid plate to fit?
   * We considered this and were going to use a sheet of thin metal from an old garage door, but in the end we didn't bother and it wasn't an issue.  
* General other mods we could do?
   * We added a drain pipe from the air filter box and ran it up the side of the driver's window to try and reduce dust and sand getting into the system.  Seemed to work.
   * We cut back all of the bumpers as high as possible so they wouldn't snag on anything.
   * We got lucky add found a member of the Fiat Forum who had 4 old rally tyres that he couldn't use anymore and he gave them us for free - I think that was a big win

Generally speaking, my main takeaway was that, for our trip at least, a diesel would have been preferable.  In that region at that time, petrol was harder to find than diesel.  Either way, take a couple of jerry cans so you always have spare fuel.

In terms of taking a regular FWD car - the other participants that we travelled with were in 4x4s.  We did get stuck a little more often than them, but not by a huge amount.  Not sure about the conditions on the Mongol rally, but we went down through Western Sahara and Mauritania and skirted the edge of the Sahara desert.  Whilst you do see the magnificent waves of golden sand that you envision when people say ""desert"", most of what you drive over is more like shingle. 

re people mentioning other cars.  One team we were with had a Panda 4x4.  It did get stuck, but only a few times, and looked like a lot of fun.  Other teams had a Suzuki SJ410 and a Ford 4x4 of some sort (forget the model) - both broke down and died, but the guys in the SJ410 probably killed it themselves by having a little too much fun in the desert.  The most reliable vehicle overall was a Land Rover Discovery - that only got stuck once and was basically bullet proof."
