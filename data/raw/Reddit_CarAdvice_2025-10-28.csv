The alternator went out in July. My dad came up to fix it and in the process, replaced the alternator and belt. After doing that, the squeaking noise started, and in an attempt to fix it, he also replaced the tensioner. Ever since then, there has been an issue with my dashboard lights and headlights dimming for minutes and seconds at a time respectively, then coming back up to full brightness and then dimming again. Last night, my power steering went down for a few moments as I was pulling into the driveway and my battery light came on and off. 

This morning, car started just fine- no battery light, power steering back up, was able to pull it forward into the carport and take it up and down the driveway. Squealing noise still present. Left it running for a few, after about ten minutes the issues with the dashboard light and headlights started. 

The belt is frayed on the sides, there's exposed stitching on both sides and black 'dust' looking stuff on top of the alternator. I have the old belt on hand for reference and the wear and tear looks pretty much the same on both of them.

1ohn8nf,"Garage said they “did nothing,” but my car suddenly drives fine- how do you handle this?","
Looking for some advice. I’ve got a 2016 Ford Fiesta that failed its MOT for play in both front track rod ends. The garage replaced them, did the MOT retest, and wheel tracking, total cost was about £350.

After the work, the steering felt loose and the car wandered when turning or accelerating. The traction control (car slipping) light also came on sometimes, so I took it back. They said everything was fine and suggested I go for a drive with the mechanic.

We went for a drive and suddenly the car felt perfect: steering tight, no wandering, no light. The mechanic insisted they hadn’t touched anything and said it was probably just “wheels slipping on wet roads.”

It’s driving fine now, but I can’t shake the feeling they quietly fixed or adjusted something and didn’t admit it.

How do you deal with garages who might not be entirely honest without sounding confrontational? And is there a way to confirm if alignment or settings were changed after the fact?

Thanks!

I have built a platform to replace my passenger seat so that I can sleep comfortably overnight in my car. I change it back and forth as needed, and it is perfect, except for the warnings.

There are three connectors that I have to unhook under the seat (after disconnecting the car’s 12v battery and displaying stored energy so airbags doesn’t go off). One or two are airbags connections. So I get the airbag system fault continuously on my dash screen, and I get the passenger seatbelt fault and chime that goes away after a minute.

Could I connect a resistor to get rid of the airbag fault? I presume since the seats have the airbags and the control module is still hooked up, the rest of airbag system would still work? If there are 2 airbag wires, and would I add a resistor to both? Not sure what each of the three connectors are for, to be honest.

Could I jumper the wires at the seatbelt connection to make that fault go away, and what wires to jumper? The actual seatbelt receiver is part of the seat assembly and will not come off easily.

I could also either purchase a seat to disassemble or buy the parts to have the electrical parts of the seat to plug in and put under the platform. I know his would include an airbag and be expensive, but it would be possible I suppose.

It used to be a loaner car and had one one minor fender bender (no repairs necessary) so I figured it had been taken care of. Within a few days of purchasing it, it stalled once. I was driving today and backing up out of my driveway and briefly paused with my foot on the break and the car stalled out again. I put it in park and started driving again and at a stop sign not even two minutes down the road it stalled out again. Then when I put it in park and started driving again this time it jolted forward a couple times and sputtered a little bit and acted funny while accelerating like it was going to stall out again while I was in the middle of accelerating.

Carmax referred me to a transmission shop and they said I probably just need a tuneup, that I had a rough idle but I wasn’t pulling any codes on the reader nor on my dash, so I tell Carmax and they send me for an appointment today at Goodyear where Goodyear tries to tell me that they have a workload of about a weeks worth of other things to do prior to getting to my car and unless I wanted to leave it overnight so they could reassess the issue they could not fit me in today. Planning on going in on Wednesday, but wondering if I should cut my loss and return the vehicle.

I post all of this to say that I’ve read awful things about these motors and I’m concerned that this issue won’t be resolved upon having a tuneup.

One of these tasks is to check how fast your engine (engine coolant) warms up. It uses your RPMs, coolant temp and ambient temp readings to estimate when your car is supposed to reach the normal operating temperature. When your car fails to reach the target fast enough, PCM throws a P0128 code and you are supposed to figure out why.

* Very often, your thermostat stuck open, partially open, or opens sooner than required.
* Not often, you are low on coolant and your coolant sensor measures the air gap temp.
* Less often, your water pump doesn't work for some reason, or there's a clogged coolant passage, and your coolant temp sensor measures the temperature of the liquid that doesn't flow through the engine.
* Less often, ambient temp sensors or coolant temp sensors report garbage readings, which alter PCM calculations.
* Rarely, your fans stuck on.
* Rarely, your thermostat temp rating is lower than your OE temp rating (wrong thermostat).

Your task is to check coolant and ambient temp readings on your dash or on your scan tool. Make sure they are not odd. Then find a video on youtube that explains how to check if your thermostat stuck open or opens sooner than required. Make sure your engine doesn't overheat while you are testing other components.

>Would it just be a defective thermostat

Post the part number you've got. If your thermostat temp rating is OE, check other options from the list above.

Since you own a Pentastar engine, it's a good idea to grab a flash light and point it in between engine heads to inspect the oil cooler housing base. If you see pink residues here, you have a leak that should be addressed."

To give you an idea of whats acceptable, GM new guidelines for new trucks states that 1 quart of oil every 1000 miles is acceptable. Thats right. New truck, 1 quart every 1000 miles is ok.


I will say that oil burning can potentially clog up catalytic converters and dirty up your engine. Its better if it doesnt burn oil, its not the end of the world if it does. 

Keep your oil level above the low line and change it around 5k miles. Dont overthink it"

2012 Wrangler JK has had a host of issues in the past. Drove to a restaurant - the ETC light came on briefly during the drive - and when we went to leave, it wouldn't start. The dash display was flickering on and off at random increments, even with the key removed, and wouldn't stop. 

Popped the hood and could hear clicking in the fuse box correlating with the dash display flickering. Gently touching the tops, felt that the IOD main fuse seemed to be the culprit (of the clicking, at least). Pulled it, and this stopped the clicking/flickering. 

Swapped with a different 60 amp fuse and got no power to anything. Switched fuses back. Roadside assistance came to try a jump (was free,.so.worth a shot). Battery tested fine. Still no power, no start, until the guy moved the negative battery terminal/wire. He said it was loose and moved easily. It did start, but puttered out once he let go of the wire (guy said it sounded ""like a fuel thing"").

Got it started one more time the same way but the same thing happened. Called a tow. Tow driver wanted to check the battery again. Still good. Told him what happened before, he tried moving the wire around. It never started or got power for long, but it did momentarily display ""no fuse"" on the dash. 

The first roadside guy thought the wiring is damaged. I read after the fact that that could be caused by removing the IOD fuse without disconnecting the battery first. 

Is flooding the engine still a thing? Could the many attempts to start have flooded the engine, causing it to stall out the times it did start?

Did I blow the wiring by removing the fuse?

What can I check or try at home?

Recently, I’ve been experiencing some weird intermittent electrical issues.

Yesterday, tried starting the car and the dashboard lights lit up for a second before they turned off and nothing happened. No sputtering, no clicking, no noises. And then on later turns the only thing that happened was dimmed dashboard lights. The car locks weren’t working, or any of the interior or exterior lights. And then electronic key fob didn’t work. It was like the car was completely dead.

After about 5 minutes, I opened the door and tried cranking again and it started perfectly fine like nothing was ever wrong. I drove around and tried stopping and cranking again and it still worked perfectly.

But again this morning I’m seeing the exact same electrical issues. And this time it doesn’t seem to crank at all. If I wait 5-10 minutes then the electricity will seem to be back (key fob works, lights turn on), but when cranking nothing happens.

The only thing I can think of would be the battery cables. In the past I’ve had issues with the connectors being loose and oxidizing, and I had to clean and tighten them.

	•	Repair option: Most people (and online sources) say cracks longer than 6 inches usually can’t be repaired. But I found a couple of local glass specialists who say they can fix it and stop it from spreading — for around $170.
	•	Aftermarket replacement: I also got a quote for an aftermarket glass replacement at $500. The shop said recalibration isn’t necessary since they wouldn’t disconnect any sensors or wiring. The shop has great reviews (5 stars from about 1,000 people), and they said the glass is from an American manufacturer like FYG, which is why the cost is lower.

BraveLordWilloughby (Score: 8): I used to work with agricultural machinery. Most of the work is, in reality, piss-easy, If everything goes right. Where the skills come in is when things don't go right.

In my (old) line of work, I used to build a lot of tedders. Easy, all straightforward. Things became awkward when threads were damaged, things were bent, holes were misaligned, etc. 

You'll have the same thing. If everything comes off an apart easy, you'll do great. If you come up against a problem (of which there could be many), you may not know how to deal with it.

I'd try. Building your own shed, fixing your own plumbing, laying your own carpet, fixing your own car, whatever, it's liberating, and it's a skill.

* • Cleaned the idle air control valve the best I could without taking it completely off buz the bolts are stripped
* Disconnected and reconnected the battery
* Replaced EGR Valve Control Solenoid (the one on the top and under the intake manifold)

She purchased it, went to the county (in Kansas) and got it registered. Got it insured and the title came back in her name, no issues.

Fast forward to today, she has had health issues and needed something smaller so I was going to purchase it from her.  Went to look at KBB and the vin number (listed on the title and registration) is too short. It has the format OK1234567890 (12 digits)

Upon further investigation there's no VIN in the window or on the door sticker (peeled off).  Hooked the truck up to an ODB2 scanner, can't read a VIN. No vin in any of the places I know of to check.

I did find a key tag in the bottom of the console that listed the year, mileage make etc and to my surprise at the bottom it said ""theft"".

Now my thoughts are that this was a theft recovery? Possibly purchased at an auction?

Unable to track down original seller.  What's the best way to go about getting this sorted out?  Can't hook vehicle up to get maintenance/fault codes or anything. I live in a state where inspections are required and no idea what kind of issues this would be if I tried to purchase from her.

She's learned the lesson for sure. If i had been involved there'd have been a Carfax report done (among other things).

This movement squeezes the pads on the other side of the rotor, and it's the same slide movement that releases the pressure when the pedal is let go. If they are not well lubricated and or rusted they are not able to move. It will cause one side of the pad to not release and eat the brake pad and rotor.

1ohunmm,Cracked Windshield on Mazda CX-30 2025 Model - Repair or Replace? Need Advice,"I have about a 7-inch crack on my Mazda CX-30’s windshield. The OEM replacement costs around $1,700, but my insurance deductible is $2,000, so that’s not really an option.

I started looking at alternatives:
	•	Repair option: Most people (and online sources) say cracks longer than 6 inches usually can’t be repaired. But I found a couple of local glass specialists who say they can fix it and stop it from spreading — for around $170.
	•	Aftermarket replacement: I also got a quote for an aftermarket glass replacement at $500. The shop said recalibration isn’t necessary since they wouldn’t disconnect any sensors or wiring. The shop has great reviews (5 stars from about 1,000 people), and they said the glass is from an American manufacturer like FYG, which is why the cost is lower.

Here are actual pics for reference :

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nry0xOMXjIvf4AqD904Dwivw4fOXFMcq

Now I’m confused:
Should I take the risk and repair it, or just spend $200 more for a replacement?
Also, is it true that recalibration might not be needed in this case?
And lastly, would it be okay to leave it for now and see if it gets worse — or do cracks usually spread faster in the winter?

Any advice or experience with similar situations would be really appreciated!

Best case scenario you'd only have bad power on your way home.

Inspecting and reseating the spark plug and ignition coil would be the first thing I'd do based on the maintenance history, but you may not have a spark plug socket on hand when road tripping. The other common cause would be the fuel injector, indicating you aren't getting any/enough/too much fuel into the cylinder. You might be able to tell this by seeing how carbonized/wet (too much fuel) or blistered (too little fuel) your spark plug is, though the foolproof test is with the injector itself, which isn't easy to do roadside either.

1ohgb7m,"Crankshaft Position Sensor replaced, car still stalling. More issues adding on.","I have a 2012 Honda civic EX 1.8L. I had the Check Emission System light come on awhile back, on and off, and then followed by surging, rough idle, power steering/VSA light coming and going, and a rasp when starting engine from time to time. I also noticed subtle jerking easing off brake. I also had to change a flat tire on my front passenger side over a month ago and right after it was replaced the check power steering/VSA came on but then went away and then came back on and off. I’m not sure if the tire being changed had anything to do with anything. Then finally it stalled. It would start for a few seconds then the engine would just die (no sound). When pressing on the gas it would sometimes stay on longer (few more seconds) but still end up stalling. Auto repair shop noted code P0335(crankshaft position sensor malfunction), PCM malfunction, modulator power source (IG) low voltage, VSA system malfunction, engine speed signal. They replaced the CKP sensor and reset the codes but it didn’t change a thing. I had a mobile mechanic come look at it and he said carbon buildup, catalytic converter clog, or needs an O2 sensor. I cleaned the EGR valve, Throttle body, new air filter, and replaced the intake hose since I saw a rip which I think happened from my partner pulling the air filter box so that was more than likely a new issue after the fact. Now I scanned it again the same P0335 came up, 2 new codes for EVAP purge flow malfunction and low purge flow detected. MAF sensor low input came up too but I believe that just came on from me unplugging it and starting the car to see if that was working. Now there is oil leaking under my vehicle from all over the bottom of the engine/oil pan. (Thin, light, and oily)I believe it’s from me not seating the PCV hose all the way in, it feels physically impossible. Also the battery light is on the dashboard now and the car won’t stay on it just stalls immediately and makes a thud when stalling. I accidentally slammed the hood on the negative battery terminal connector so I wonder if I made the battery issue. I also tightened the clamp too much. I bought a new clamp so I plan on installing that asap. My splashguard came off a few months back so now I’m believing the stalling stemmed from that.

My GF has an 04 Lexus ES330, it's maintained like absolute shit, and is a miracle it's still running, but that's neither here nor there.

I replaced her headlights this weekend. All I had to do was pop the battery out to reach them. Easy peasy. Popped the battery back in, checked the lights, called it a day. (And did turn the lights off)

This morning we leave at the same time for work, and her car had an awful delay turning over, kind of had a rumble to it. It sounded really weak like low power, and was shaking pretty bad. The most similar thing I can describe it as is if she had a sparkplug out.

I investigated this afternoon. Battery is 6 months old, little to no corrosion, terminals are tight.

No check engine codes. 2 bad O2 sensors.

I started it again, and still weak.

The only thing out of whack is some 1/4"" vacuum hose from some godforsaken depth of her engine, that had come unplugged from the intake manifold. I plugged it in while the engine was running. Made sure all the other hoses were good. It seemed to level out. Drove the car around the block and it drove fine.

Turned it off and started it again, and turned over like normal. Could that little hose really cause all that ruckus? 

Follow up, is 450-500 RPM a standard idle for a V6 Lexus? I've never driven the car so I have no frame of reference.

I've never been here before, and the most work I've done on my own car is replaced the wiper fluid and flipped some switches in the fuse box. Otherwise, I'm very out of my depth. I suspect the answer to this question is ""no"" and the solution is ""get a car that does this"", but I'm hoping someone knows something I don't, sees something I don't, or has had this issue themselves and can tell me how they solved it.

I travel a lot in the car with my dog (she's 10 and basically has a type of arthritis) so she has the entire backseat to herself. I need the trunk space for our stuff, so I can't load her in through there anymore, and I have my own back problems, so I can't keep lifting her up/down and there isn't always someone to help me. She sometimes can climb into the front seat and climb from there into the backseat, but it's hard on her hips (she's been limping this week from doing that twice within the last 10 days).

**Car info:** I have a 2015 Mercedes ML400. I unfortunately don't know the engine size off the top of my head or the mileage, but this car used to be my mom's, then my sister's, and they both drive a *lot*, so the mileage is definitely in the tens of thousands. I do know the transmission is automatic, though.

**Car question:** Every ramp or staircase I've gotten won't fit against the back seats because the doors for the back don't open wide enough. Ramps/stairs can fit in the front door perfectly fine because that door opens (assuming) 90 degrees, but the back doors (assuming again) open about 75 degrees or so. Is it possible to get my back door, even just one of them, to clear a bit more so I can fit something sturdy for my dog to climb onto? If yes, I would most likely pay someone else to do it; what kind of person would you recommend? If not, why not? (I want to understand stuff!)

1ohluhl,Broken valve cover bolt,"Hello all, 

Im wondering how to approach this problem I have. I was trying to change the valve cover on a 2005 odyssey when i snapped one of the bolts (bad judgment on my end) that holds it in place. The good thing is that it is in a nice place and easily accessible, but I have questions: 
 
* What is the best way to try and remove the broken bolt? 

* is it better to use a left fluted drill bit?
* which extractors are better for this type of situation? Tapered square or spiral?

I figured it is best to use a left fluted drill bit instead of a right fluted one (a decent cobalt infused one which is hard and able to drill into the steel bolt) along with a bit of oil and patience because it has to be drilled anyways. 


It measures 3.5mm to 4mm across the threads of the top of the broken bolt. 

With luck,  the left fluted drill bit will “catch” the bolt and essentially bring it out. If not, i need to use an extractor as a next step, right? But which one? Spiral or tapered square? 

I am bit overwhelmed but i know this isn’t that difficult as well. 

Any recommendations or answers to any of my questions are appreciated.

Secure-Researcher892 (Score: 2): Another CVT is just another CVT...  CVT transmissions at this point are problems waiting to happen.  Old school manuals with a clutch really only have a clutch to replace and it isn't difficult or that expensive... but a CVT's wearable component is deep inside the transmission and will always be more expensive to fix.  So if you fix it just know that it will die again and be even more expensive the next time.  

Frankly I wouldn't use a transmission chain shop to fix it if you decide to.  Those places are not doing anything different than other independent transmission shops, they just charge you more.  

Frankly it shouldn't cost that much to diagnose the transmission that is just slipping.  And it shouldn't be that difficult for a shop to fix that.  It will cost more than you want to pay because of the labor involved in removing the transmission and taking it apart.  But so long as the car is just slipping and hasn't completely failed then the odds are high that it is the metal belt inside that has worn and only the wore parts will need replacing... What totals a transmission is when the belt breaks and pieces of it get pulled into every possible place you don't want them.  

Call around and you should be able to find a better price than that chain shop.  The other reality is a CVT transmission is far less complicated than automatic transmissions when you get inside them, honestly easier to repair but they still cost because of time to remove them and open them up."

-NOT_A_MECHANIC- (Score: 1): The cyclone/duratecs are very easy on oil. People will tell you “oil it doesn’t degrade” which is true to an extent. But. Oil, especially newer thinner oil, relies a lot on additives. Antiwear, detergent, dispersant, corrosion inhibitors, viscosity modifiers, foaming inhibitors, antioxidizers, so on and so forth. Oil in a bottle isn’t the same as oil in an engine. It’s exposed to blowby contaminants like water, fuel, soot. Several additives perform multiple functions, so when they’re consumed protecting the oil, you’re not just losing “cleaning” additives. You’re losing several, and now the oil may not protect as well or actually damage the engine as it becomes acidic or allows corrosion. 

This is a drawn out way of saying, either frequently take longer trips so the oil reaches and maintains temperature long enough to get rid of fuel/water in the oil, or keep the 6 month interval."

1ohov3p,Ongoing issue with otherwise perfect car,"I bought a BMW 218d with 100k miles on the clock in July. We paid for a 3 year warranty. I took it on a short test drive and didn't feel any issues, but first time I took it on the motorway it had an issue with veering to one side under acceleration and veering back when power is let off. 

I returned the car within a week and they replaced the lower suspension arms. Issue was better on pick up. 

Three weeks later and the veering issue was back and much worse, the garage took the car back and replaced the lower suspension arms again. 

When I picked it up, the guy from the garage said 'it's 1000 times better than it was', which obviously meant it wasn't fixed.

Issue has got steadily worse to the state it was before. Do I continue to deal with the garage since this is obviously a continuation of the initial issue? 

We have since found the MOT report from February which also showed that the lower suspension arms were replaced then too. 

We've put 7k miles on the vehicle since we bought it. 

Thanks for any advice.

1ohos2y,How are these as a daily? Too uncomfortable/cramped? Coming from a Twingo RS,"Looking for a new car, currently own a Twingo RS, looking likely to be too uneconomical to repair. 

I really loved the Twingo but have wanted something a bit nicer for a while, fancied a change nonetheless. Want something a bit faster, more premium/comfortable but that still has the ""go-kart"" like driving feels. 

From what I've gathered, the Cooper S/JCW seems like the go-to that doesn't cost a small fortune. Seem pretty reliable and insurance is quite cheap especially compared to other hot hatches. 

I've heard a lot of people say they're very firm and uncomfortable though. That's one of my main gripes with the Twingo, it's about as comfortable as falling down the stairs. It has the cup suspension and is on H&R springs so that definitely doesn't help. On the right road it's fantastic but otherwise can feel a chore which ruins the fun. 

Also, what's the sound isolation like in these? That's the main thing I hated about the Twingo compared to most cars I've driven or been in. Theres so much road noise. 

I've never had an issue with the Twingo in terms of size, feels a bit like a tardis when you look at the outside. The occasional rear passengers I have claim it's not bad in the back.

I don’t find it uncomfortable, but you do notice bumps in the road that the Crossover wankers probably don’t. 

Sound isolation is pretty good though, really depends on tyres, mine came with some run flats and I’d have told you the opposite, switched to Kumhos and it’s been a night and day difference on the motorway.

I don’t find the F56 minis cramped at all, I had an R50 for a short stint and that was also weirdly roomy even though they’re quite a bit smaller. I’m 6ft and still have plenty of headroom, comfortable distance from the wheel etc, my friend is 6’3 and he’s a big lad, but still can adjust the passenger seat to give himself plenty of room and it doesn’t feel like we’re shoulder to shoulder.

1ohnnr4,1.5 Duratorq engine kaputt; likely failure mechanism and costs??,"After a nice few days away last week, we we driving home in my wife’s 67 plate Kuga 1.5TDCi Duratorq at 60-70mph when it: 

- spontaneously over-revved a couple of times
- engine then died and cranks over but refuses to restart
- it has pressurised the water system (coolant reservoir level was previously normal, after the incident the reservoir was chock full)
- AA guy (3.5 hours later) took the coolant reservoir cap off and the system was still sufficiently pressurised to spit coolant out 
- other than the over-reviving then cutting out, I didn’t observe any other problems - no mechanical knocks, no plume of smoke, temperature normal, oil level still okay.  (When it first over-revved I was concerned the turbo oil seals had given up and the engine was going to chew itself to bits).  

The AA guy said he thought it was a head gasket failure but the symptoms don’t tie in with my previous experience of head gasket failure (caused by over-exuberant driving, symptoms sporadic misfire at low revs, gradual coolant use and a plume of vapour from the exhaust).  

So - has anyone out there: 

(a) experienced a similar failure mechanism and can give an opinion on what the cause was? 
(b) got an indication of likely repair costs if, as I fear, it’s a failure within the block or the head and thus a potential engine swap needed?  The car has done 82k so would probably be about £9k to replace, so I’m thinking £5k ish should be the maximum to spend to get it back on the road, otherwise I might as well sell it for salvage, swallow the cost difference and buy something else.

The car was plagued with faults from day one but one thing that stood out was just how powerful the car was from a standing start - literally pinned you in your seat.

Due to the faults, Audi eventually agreed to a like for like swap but the only model they had available for an instant swap was the same spec but a 2022 model with only 18k miles on the clock. However, since having this new one (about 2 weeks now) it’s absolutely clear that this one is nowhere near as powerful bottom end.

A few things I’ve read

1 - the 2022 model has perhaps been down tuned to fall inline with the changes in emission laws etc in the uk

2 - the previous owner was perhaps a very timid driver and the car has adjusted to this and maybe just needs ‘the cobwebs blowing off’ (adaptive learning it was called)

WompinWompa (Score: 1): I wrote a massive response to this and then lost it all.

The only thing I was able to find is car sites saying that the 2022 has a slight advantage in fuel efficiency compare to the 2021, and more efficiency will likely mean less power. So maybe you're right and it has a slightly different ECU map that is downtuned slightly to meet emissions standards. 

I cant find anything official about it, but truthfully as someone that loves cars if Audi say its fine and I still want to know I would find a VAG/German car specialist and explain the situation, explain that after having a massive number of issues you just want this one to work and you're not made of money so you dont want Audi fobbing you off.

Then get them to inspect the car, I would probably start with the Intake system and make sure its not absolutly full of carbon, as idling with the stop start system turned off when the car starts or in traffic for long periods of time mean that the airflow through the intake system is low and thus the carbon has more time to stick to the intake system somewhere (Normally the plenum or the tops of the valves, which like a heart attack eventually clogs the intake so much that your car struggles to breath and MPG/Power goes down.

This is a big problem for all cars with all the new emissions systems as they recirculate dirty air from the exhaust system back into the clean air system which brings with it sooty carbon... which eventually gets stuck.

Anyway, that would be my only assumption as people love to buy diesels and do short journeys and clog up their DPFS.
Unless there was something SERIOUSLY wrong in which case... there'd be an Engine light on I'm sure.

TLDR
1. Accept it might be slower due to emissions
2. Get someone you can trust to look at it and check its not clogged up *DPF or Intake System*

I'm in the market for a used car. I had no plans to change but my 1.2l Seat Ibiza Fr (2015) was recently written off so my hand has been forced.

I'm looking for something with the following requirements.

**Price** \- €15,000 or around that. (Based in Ireland)

**Year** \- Ideally something 2017/2018 or younger.

**Mileage** \- I would like something that is under 50k miles / 80k kilometres. Not a deal breaker but would like something that hasn't got a lot on the clock.

**Reliability** \- I would like a car that won't have me in a garage for repairs if well looked after. I rarely had to go near one with my Ibiza.

**Comfort** \- The main trips will be relatively short commutes to work and leisure activities but I would like a car that is well able to handle some long journeys once or twice a week for example.

**Fuel** \- Following on from above, I would be leaning towards petrol due to the fact that I won't be doing daily long commutes but I would need it to be a petrol car that is still comfortable for long journeys.

**Storage** \- I'm an avid golfer so need to haul my bag and electric trolley about the place a lot. My Ibiza wasn't big enough to store all in my boot so it left me having to transport it in my back seat. Therefore, I would need something with a decent size boot or something like the 'Magic Seats' that Honda offer.

**Trim** \- I would like a car with a quality trim. Something with high quality technology inside, nice interior materials and safety features etc. My Ibiza was the Fr model which was quite sporty which I did like.

**Engine** \- I'm seeing a lot of 1.0l turbo engines for sale but have heard a lot of people say that a number of them are not ideal for the cars they are in. I would be leaning towards something that is a 1.4 turbo or bigger but again, I'm open to suggestions.

**Transmission** \- Have always drove a manual so would be leaning towards that but I am not totally against an automatic if people feel it is a better option.

As stated above, my price range is around €15k so hoping something will pop up which ticks all of the above boxes. I would also be interested to see anything that may be well suited to me even if it's slightly out of my price range.

Would appreciate any input or suggestions.

How they work is you take pictures of your car, service book etc, tell them of any known issues with the car, they give you a guide price (higher then WBAC)
You then call them to confirm if you wish to proceed.
then they put the car on auction to the trade, so you could actually get more then the guide price.

My sale went smoothly, there was no hint of the dealer trying to haggle.

He then called his boss to confirm that the car was as I'd described it, and the money was in my bank account instantly.

I was however, prepared to let the driver leave empty-handed if there was any hint of trying to haggle as I knew I'd answered the questions honestly and declared all the marks etc. I'd advise anyone else to do the same if there's any attempted haggling.

Wonder if anyone can advise on following

Came out of a cafe on Saturday past to see my car had rolled backwards (either left handbrake off or it slipped) into another vehicle. 

Head wasn't really with it as I have been going through a very difficult time (was quite upset in cafe beforehand)

Anyways I waited around trying to identify who owned the car and eventually someone approached and I established it was their car. 
Apologised and they were understanding, actually saw me upset previously in cafe before either of us knew of this incident

I advised I would rather avoid insurance companies (losing NCB and subsequent hikes) and pay for the damage personally
They were open to that and we swapped details. 

Doesn't look like a lot of damage but of course these things can really cost 

Nevertheless, I received a notification from my insurer today about a claim being made. I phoned up and confirmed the incident with them. 

I've contacted the owner again who is taking the car into garage Thursday this week and is willing to allow me to sort privately. 

If I do I'll save my NCB going from 9 years to 3

I'm afraid yes, your insurance will go up becuase on renewal, you'll need to declare you've had an accident in the last X years when asked. That's why the question is generally worded ""have you had any accidents or claims, regardless of fault, in the last X years"". When you declare that accident, it will load your premium a bit. Hard to say how much, but that's normally dependent on the claim amount etc.

1ohew5x,Brake pads,"Hello. Can I get an advice on the state of these front  brake pads?. 

I got my car in 2023 and have driven 21k miles since then. I didn’t see any evidence of brakes done with previous owner so I have been quite wary of damaging the discs. Occasionally I hear some squeal when I apply the brakes but this doesn’t happen always. When I try to slam them after hearing once to test, it feels like the sound is no longer there so it’s quite confusing.

With regards to my driving habits, I believe in gently stopping and slowing down using engine braking than slamming the brake pads.

Had some trouble with my VW Polo. The drive shaft bolts loosened, and after I heard some clunking, I had to pull over on the motorway. 

Once we got it to a safe place, AA managed to get the bolts back in and torqued them so I could limp home. But the part above came off. 

I took it to the mechanic (who, in January of this year, replaced the drive shaft), and they put threadlocker on the bolts and torqued them up to spec. 

When I was leaving, I asked about the part above, and they said it wouldn't be a problem, and it was just there to stop ingress. 

Firstly, does anyone know any systemic issue that might cause the problem I had (i.e. would it happen again)?

And, how necessary is the part above?

1ohditj,Experience with importing Truck from USA? Preferably RAM 3500,"Hi everyone,

Bit of a random one but I’ve been seriously looking at getting one of those Ram 3500 pickups from the states. I’ve always wanted something with proper presence on the road, and these look unreal. I know they’re a bit big for the UK but I live somewhat near a dual carriageway so it should be alright most of the time if I drive it on there besides when I need to go shopping which isn't most of the driving I do. 

I’m mostly wondering how the import process works. Like, do you just buy it online and they send it over on a boat, or is there paperwork? I’ve watched a few YouTube videos but they don’t really explain what happens after it arrives. I want it as new as possible - preferably a 6.7 Cummins because I’ve heard those engines last forever and can pull down a house if needed.

I did check the weight and it says around 3,500kg which I think is fine for a normal licence? (Happy to upgrade if needed, don’t want to get pulled over every time)

Only a few concerns really:

* Which shops typically have the biggest parking bays that you use?
* Can I still take it through a car wash or is it too wide?
* How does warranty work if it’s American?

I’ve seen people get a bit touchy about these trucks here, saying you can’t see kids in front of them. That’s fine, I don’t really see kids much anyway, and I can always lean forward if needed. I know people get really dramatic about it but there's always going to be the Greta's of the world lol.

Also seen loads of comments about “compensating” and stuff, which I don’t really get. I’ve got nothing to prove, I just want something big, loud and unnecessarily powerful that makes sense to absolutely no one but me. I might put a sticker on the tailgate that says “It’s not about the size, it’s about the torque” just to clear things up. People really annoy me with the size stuff, is it technically illegal to put a QR code sticker to a photo of myself to disprove the accusations? Would be really funny if people would be like ""Oh I bet he's compensating"" only to scan the QR code and be like ""Ah I was righ-"" scrap that idea actually I don't want to give them the satisfaction

If anyone’s imported one before, what did it cost roughly? I’d probably only use it for local runs — Tesco, tip runs, weddings, that sort of thing. Maybe once a week to scare the life out of the cul-de-sac. I want a nice bright colour so I can scroll through the local facebook page really fast an efficiently to see if some Karen has posted about me

1ohdi5v,Insurance valuation claims,"So I was involved in an accident, totally not my fault. Vehicle is slightly damaged, but as a 15 year old car, it's deemed a write off.

The insurers have offered me £940 - deductions for the car - 12% because it was a previous CatC write off (when purchased) and £250 buy back cost. The excess is not payable as non fault, although there's obviously a risk that may change.

The thing is, I've rung around scrapyards and nobody is willing to pay more than £125 for the car, so the £250 is ridiculous.

And I challenged the £940 - the cheapest I can find a comparable vehicle is £1500 - far side of the country, with most being around the £2k mark. They said they only look at private sales on a vehicle of this age. I pointed out that buying a car of this age privately carries substantial risks unless you are a mechanic and can thoroughly check the vehicle out first.

1ohcva9,Pickup Truck or Large SUV for frequent towing?,"I will preface with the fact that I know next to nothing about cars and have been trying to learn.

I am opening a Food trailer and am going to have to tow the trailer probably daily or at least most days and have been looking for the ideal car to do this with. I figured with a heavy trailer I would be better going for a vehicle that is as beefy as I can. I would also like to have some of the towing QOL features available in some of the more modern cars, I like the idea of the extra comfort you get from SUV's but for the most part it seems to be at the cost of the reliability of a pickup.

My budget is around £20k so I am obviously looking at used.

The cars I have been looking at include:

VW Touareg - Seems like a good, sensible option. But suffers a bit in reliability  
Mitsubishi Shogun/Pajero - Robust and reliable, people seem to really like them  
Land Rover variant - Supposed to be good for towing but I also hear they are in the shop more than on the road

The other option is a pick up truck which when looking into all seem to be fairly reliable. my top 2 would be a Toyota Hilux or an Isuzu D-Max because I hear they are both very tough and reliable, I could also just about get a KGM Musso that is still under warranty but I worry about parts availability with a less common truck like that, Not sure if the warranty would be worth the risk.

Any advice would be appreciated because I have been going kind of nuts trying to figure out what car would best suit me.

1ohajt2,BMW M2C to Octavia VRS,"Right, so I completely understand this is a question that depends on circumstances. But I’m curious if anyone has done a similar thing and how you felt after doing so/what your drivers were.

My current situation is that I can comfortably afford my M2C and enjoy the car. However, I feel the money that I spend on it currently can be better placed elsewhere. Whether that be holidays, home improvements, hobbies, or even just savings, investments or paying the mortgage off quicker.

It’s also worth noting that I’m quite apprehensive of the near future economically speaking. I get a fair bit of visibility into what’s going on and it’s not great out there. So, this is a case of tightening of the belt too in preparation.

I am a petrolhead and quite fancy the look of the Octavia VRS estate >2017, petrol EA888. They’re fun, tuneable, comparatively cheap to run vs the M2C, reliable (minus water pump…). This allows me to still enjoy my car, go to shows and meets etc, whilst saving c£300 a month in running costs.

Under the consumer rights act, a car needs to be fit for purpose and last a reasonable amount of time. 13 months isn't a reasonable amount of time. 
I feel a bit bad because the dealer is a decent family run outfit and they obviously didn't design the engine - but they should know about the crankshaft problem. I can't ignore the fact I'm £16000 out of pocket. I did ask them to replace the engine when it blew up but there was no engines available from Land Rover at the time and they wouldn't fit a second hand one. They did offer me a car to use while I decided what to do.

Your beef should very much be with Land Rover. Was the car serviced in accordance with their schedule by LR dealers themselves? If so, you could try arguing for some goodwill from them.
