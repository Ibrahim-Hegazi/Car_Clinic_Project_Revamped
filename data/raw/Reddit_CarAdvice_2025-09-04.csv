1n7unxv,"Soft-top motors struggling, now won’t close at all","I’ve got a 2006 Z4 roadster with an automatic soft-top convertible, and the roof mechanism has been giving me problems since day one.

When I press the button to open it, the motors kick on but they’re loud, clunky, and the roof jerks back pretty aggressively. Not smooth at all, but it still manages to get the job done when opening.

Closing it is where the real problem is. At first, it would pull the top forward but the motors clearly struggled. Once it got all the way up, the system would just kind of give up; the motors would let go, and the top would slam shut on its own. From what I’ve researched, that’s not how it’s supposed to work.

Now it’s worse. The top won’t close on its own at all. I have to manually pull it up and lock it. If I press the button to close, the motors still make noise like they’re trying, but they can’t actually move the roof anymore.

I have no idea what the problem may be. Is it usually a motor issue? A hydraulic problem? Looking for advice before I take it in.

Here's a video in case if you want to see how the soft-top works now.

As for ""best,"" that's going to depend heavily on what he works on or plans to work on, and what he's doing or plans to do.

Unfortunately the best judge of this will probably be your husband as he's going to have a better idea of what he could actually use, what might help save him time and hassles, etc. etc. etc.

i’m a bit confused here. I didn’t think it was them until they showed me these pictures. I also think it’s suspicious that the after pictures are much lower resolution than before, but I could still see a crack clear that there was not present in the before. 

Is this normal? They’re generally nice but they did forget to install the camera the first time. And I understand how it’s annoying to have customers say you caused pre-existing damage. I didn’t think it was them until they showed me the pictures, though they do not agree. They said they would not admit fault and we would have to take them to court. That also kind of took me by surprise because again I wasn’t blaming them in the first place. they were pretty hostile when they brought up the photos, which is funny because that is now the only reason why I think they did it.

We have already fixed/looked over the brakes so I know it’s not that. I’m hesitant to take it to a shop again and have them diagnose/fix issues that won’t actually fix the main issue as I am pregnant and work but have been saving up for things for the baby and can’t just keep spending money on stuff that isn’t the actual issue.

I have a 2018 Subaru Legacy. I had a ball joint replaced a month or so ago on the right side, but still noticed vibration when I drove away from the shop, especially at higher speeds. This has only gotten worse, even at slower speeds, and I’ve noticed it’s especially bad when I’m going down hills or braking.

1n7sd35,Should I get my CVT transmission fluid exchanged? (2015 Honda Civic),"I went in for a brake fluid exchange today and the dealership tells me I should get my transmission fluid exchanged. The car has 64K miles on it. It's nearing 10 years old. Should I go for the transmission fluid exchange? I've never had it done before.

I usually think about the recommendations and come back for them if I decide I need them and it's not easy to do myself (like a cabin filter or new windshield wipers). 

The 2015 civic or 9th gen doesn't explicitly say in the owner's manual when to get the transmission fluid changed. It says to just defer to the maintenance minder. Well, either my maintenance minder is broken, it never went off for anything other than the oil change, or the tech reset it without my realizing as it has never gone off for anything. 

But the 8th Gen or 2011 civics apparently says to change the transmission fluid every 60K miles. Which would mean my car is about due for a change. 

The transmission fluid change is $200 vs a new transmission is around $7500, so it seems worth it in the long run. Plus, the transmission is pretty important.

What's the opinion? Is the CVT fluid change worth it?

** Also, is there any issue with changing the transmission fluid if the car is over 10 years old?

So I’ve come to two things it could be 

Either the front axle U joints. A few months ago they were making a bunch of noise but the sound went away. I meant to replace them but I had to get the transmission rebuilt so that side lined the u joints

The other possibility is the control arms. The drivers side lower arm has a noticeable amount of play 

The death wobble only happens on the highway, and it seems to only happen around 60-65 miles an hour. But it doesn’t happen everytime I drive those speeds, only on occasion. Other than the death wobble theirs a slight shimmy at 55-60 (which is why I think it could be the U joints). 

Eventually I’d like to get both done but right now it’s not financially feasible to get both done at the same time

I've had no issues with it until this year, but shortly after a deer collision (insurance covered repairs, primarily superficial), I blew out the same wheel (t-ire on front driver side) 4 times over the course of 4 months. After the 3rd replacement, AAA said recurring issue was due to r-ust damage and replaced the front strut assembly, lower control arms and did an alignment ($3000 cost). When I picked the car up, that same t-ire looked low and went flat within a week. I've now had it towed to another repair shop, who says the tie rods are stiff (indicating AAA probably did NOT do the alignment) and that they need replacement plus another alignment (another $1700, including t-ire replacement).... my question is, does this combination of factors seem like the reasonable culprit for the recurring blow out situation? I just can't keep putting money and time into this same issue, not to mention risk for accidents. At this point I'm around $5000+ in repairs (including previous t-ire replacements), which is half the kelly blue book estimate on the car's current value. On the other hand, if this DOES fix the issue, then I could probably get several more years out of it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

I'm really confused about which type of engine oil to use on my 2010 Camry with a 3.5L V6 engine (2GR-FE). I live in South East Asia, where temperature ranges from 10°C to 35°C around the year, and it stays at 30°C+ for 4 months in a year.



At first, 5W-30 seems like the obvious choice - In every owner's manual I found online, and every forum posts, I see 5W-30 getting recommended all the time.



However, once I read from the manual that came with my camry (first attached pic), I'm hella confused now. It seems like 10W-30 would be way better for me, as I almost always drive at 10°C+, which exceeds the recommended temperature range of 5W-30 according to my manual.



Also, what does ""Temperature range anticipated before next oil change"" mean? Does it mean 'the ambient temperature that the engine operates in', 'oil temperature when engine is idle', or something else? Also, I'm curious as to why is there a difference between the manual from my car vs the ones I find online.

I find myself traveling with my Toyota C HR (I bought it two months ago with 90,000 km on top) I find a noise that I do not know what it is, I do not know how to describe it, like a very subtle sound of scratched cd that sounds on the driver's side when turning, it is much more noticeable at rondabouts,  it is very subtle, of course when I get home I will take it the mechanic, but I would like to know if you think it is something very serious not to take the highway, for example.



Thank you very much! I appreciate any advice",1,1756928526.0,2,MechanicAdvice,1757014485,2025-09-03 19:42:06,2025-09-04 19:34:45,"Gunk_Olgidar (Score: 1): Check for a bent dust shield or stone/pebble stuck between rotor and dust shield.   Or loose wheel weight smacking against the brake caliper.

1n7onbf,Leak ID help,"2004 Honda accord, 4cyl, 227k miles.

Just doing some maintenance and wanted to see if I can get rid of some leakage next time around.

First two pics are the oil pan and some part I’m not sure about above the oil filter. They’re the only two places that seem like they’re leaking. 
I lose about 1.5q of oil in between changes (5k interval). 

Next two are of the power steering rack, first the right side, then the left. I’m guessing I’m just gonna need to swap this one out, unless I’m able to stop the leaks while it’s on the car? 

Last three are of a tiny tiny coolant leak I’m trying to find, it started happening after I changed the thermostat. I poured some coolant UV dye and searched the whole car in the dark, nothing that I could see except some very faint residue on that same unknown part above the oil filter and the thermostat housing. 

I’m not too confident that it’s the thermostat or the housing, since there isn’t any seepage around the seal, if it were leaking I’m thinking it would be a much brighter green. 

Any advice and pointers on what that unknown part it would help a bunch, thanks!

Also looks like some leftover mess from the last oil change beneath the oil filter, which if true will make locating actual oil leak(s) a PITA.

Suggestion, get under it and spend an hour or so to clean it off ***really well*** with brake cleaner and dry well to clean bare metal with paper towels.   Completely dry, no wet oil stain at all.   Will take some effort.

Then drive it normally and inspect again after a few days or the following weekend to pinpoint the leak(s)."
1n7olfg,2002 Toyota Camry 2.4L - Stalling and running rough after air filter change,"Hello everyone,

I need some advice with my 2002 Toyota Camry (2.4L, 4-cylinder). The car was running perfectly fine until I tried to change the engine air filter today.

While I was putting the air filter box back together, one of the screws wouldn't tighten down properly, so the housing isn't completely sealed shut.

I made the mistake of starting the engine anyway, and now I have major issues:

* **Stalling:** The engine starts, but it will die unless I'm pressing the gas pedal. As soon as I let off the gas, it turns off.
* **Rough Idle and Strange Noise:** When it is running, it sounds very rough and there's a loud coming from the engine bay.
* **No Heat at Idle:** The engine temperature gauge stays on cold. If I hold the RPMs up by pressing the gas for 5-10 minutes, the temperature will slowly start to rise, but it drops again if the engine stalls.

What exactly is the likely failure point here?

1n7nqi4,What should i do?,"2006 C6 corvette automatic.

I had a mechanic, who is also my personal friend ive known for a few years and does good work and generally pretty knowledgeable come to my house, and install a radiator in my car because i was so busy with work and didnt want to mess with it myself on my only day off which i also had many errands to catch up on.

He installs the radiator 15 minutes before i got the coolant to him, and i tell him ill fill it with coolant, and bleed the air myself just install it which he did. After i finish, i go to drive it to see if its bled correctly.

He did not secure/tighten the transmission lines correctly to the radiator and caused the transmission fluid to leak out.

Between idling the car and bleeding it for 30 minutes, and then driving about 2 minutes down the road, im guessing virtually all my transmission fluid leaked out, and the car stopped accelerating or moving and trans fluid was leaking from the trans lines.

Is this on him or me? He said i should have double checked his work and verified no leaks etc, i was bringing him the coolant and was 15 minutes away, but gave him the option of waiting or i will fill with coolant myself because i did not want to make him wait. He said he would wait but instead left.

The day of, i told him what happened and he said we will figure it out etc, drop the pan put new fluid and fix the leak, see if its fine and i have not contacted him since nor has he.

Im pretty sure the transmission is done for, if not heavily damaged/worn. Is he at fault, or am i for not giving him coolant to start the car up and verify the radiator install is correct?

I am debating whether to take him to small claims court as i feel as yes i should have provided coolant etc, but regardless this shouldn't have happened and should have been done correctly.

He charged me $100, and did not offer to refund me either.

1n7mq74,Custom a/c diag.,"I need some help from some veteran A/C guys.

1993 GMC sonoma with new oe evap and receiver. It has a sanden sd-7, a 1995 jimmy 134a condenser, and a aftercooler chiller for the supercharger.

I am having a hell of a time getting this thing to get cold. The chiller has its own TXV and theres a blue orifice in the cabin circuit ( have tried a white and red can’t remember the orifice size). 
 
There are 2 12” electric fans blowing through the condenser that are on constant when the a/c is on (maybe i need to had 2 pushers?) 

Currently it is charge with 34oz r134a and these are the readings I’m getting at idle with a 84* ambient and a 75* vent (max settings) since its a custom system i don’t know exactly what the charge should be. 

Hopefully somebody can give me some pointers. Cheers!

Given the car and age I lean toward the exhaust. These engines have a large round gasket between the exhaust manifold and the catalytic converter. It's sturdy but it wasn't meant to last 20 years, let alone 30. It's considered a wear item. Once that gasket starts degrading it pulls air in and the O2 sensor interprets it as a lean running condition and send the signal to the ECU to start dumping fuel in the injectors.

When I press the button to open it, the motors kick on but they’re loud, clunky, and the roof jerks back pretty aggressively. Not smooth at all, but it still manages to get the job done when opening.

Closing it is where the real problem is. At first, it would pull the top forward but the motors clearly struggled. Once it got all the way up, the system would just kind of give up; the motors would let go, and the top would slam shut on its own. From what I’ve researched, that’s not how it’s supposed to work.

Now it’s worse. The top won’t close on its own at all. I have to manually pull it up and lock it. If I press the button to close, the motors still make noise like they’re trying, but they can’t actually move the roof anymore.

I have no idea what the problem may be. Is it usually a motor issue? A hydraulic problem? Looking for advice before I take it in.

Here's a video in case if you want to see how the soft-top works now.

It does have some cosmetic body damage, but has ran fine for me, besides a throttle body position sensor that was replaced around 80k miles. Currently mechanically sound.

These can all be super helpful questions to ask and things to look out for. The more we can recreate it the easier it will be to pinpoint. If you can do it while parked, that means you can have someone literally inspecting at the same time. Best case scenario. Worst case scenario it’s only when you drive. Make aggressive medium swerves on an empty road. Does the noise change? If so it’s probably a wheel bearing.

Most quick change oil places use cheap filters to save money. As long as the filter has the same threads and mounting base sizes it will work, although cheaper filters sometimes are missing back flow valves and quality filter media among other construction differences. It is cheaper to use one diameter of casing and just use a different bottom for it.

EDIT: He works for a local mom & pop shop and they do not provide shit in comparison to where we came from. (I'm drowning in kit orders.)
His work is very much more Ford vs. Ferrari. Nothing older than 20 yrs. (Unless his boss thinks it's cool) nothing too exotic

Could this be from the intake not being sealed correctly, or something left loose during reassembly? I also noticed a faint plastic/burning smell at one point.

Are these normal readings for the fuel tank pressure (evap vapor pressure) sensor
Shouldnt the reading with KOEO be close the barometric pressure of 13.34 psi? 13.25 Pa (pascals) is like 0.001 psi, so a bit off... Or is the Pa reading only measuring the difference between pressures, and therefore a reading close to 0 indicates its at atmospheric pressure? 

It stays right at exactly 13.25 Pa and then once in a while it will flash a mirrored number of -13.25 Pa. Once the engine is idling and the commanded evap purge gets to about 8% (about 4:30 in video) the pressure readings start fluctuating between 100 Pa and -130 Pa when I believe they should be negative readings due to the vacuum drawing the vapors out. And then you still see the numbers 13.25 and -13.25 popping up over and over again... Also I noticed that every reading is a multiple of 13.25. 26.5, 39.75, 53... then instead of 66.25 it reads 66.5. Does this indicate a bad sensor?

I'm trying to track down the cause of my clogged/failing catalytic converter. I just now before taking these readings replaced the pcv valve hose because I noticed it was partially collapsed. I thought maybe that would help the evap pressure readings because it affects the vacuum or something...? The car actually idles worse now than when I ran it last night with the collapsed hose... Now the idle drops down to 500s sometimes and it feels like there's more engine vibration. It idled fine before, 700 rpm give or take 10-15. The pressure readings didn't change at all with the new hose as far as I can tell.

1n76go1,Help with Installing a new radio.,"So, I messed something up. Here's the whole sordid tale. 

A little while back, I bought a cheap vehicle from a guy I barely knew. I was in a bad situation, and just needed something that would get me somewhere else. I had to replace the battery, but other than that, she runs fine. There's just one detail: her radio is smashed in. Thinking I was smart, I bought an aftermarket radio online, thinking the installation would be easy. 

It was not. 

*After* cutting off the factory wire harness thinking I could match the wires to the new harness, I found I...couldn't. None of the documentation I can find online matches the wire colors I have, and the way the wires were arranged in the factory harness doesn't link up to anything either. I tried desperately to reattach the wires to their original place in the factory harness, but I, genius that I am, cut them right up against the harness, so there's no hope of reattaching. 

I wrapped everything in electrical tape, put my dash back together, and have more or less given up. Before I take her into the shop though, I figured I'd ask if anyone here might have some answers. 

She's a 2006 Chrysler 300. The first image is the radio wires I have, recently freed from their harness and splayed so the color codes can be made out. The second is the color codes of the aftermarket radio I bought. All I need is a wiring diagram that matches these particular wires, but I'm not entirely sure one exists: as you can see, there are *two* separate green/orange wires, which makes exactly zero sense to me.

I've been told its possibly a O2 sensor thing, but I want to be sure before taking it to the shop.

Hills have been nightmares. I need a little more gas to get up, however my RPM's go bonkers the moment I add any more acceleration. I do notice that if I just drop gears and accelerate that way, it tends to work. It's weird. Going from 3k RPM in 3rd and pressing the gas further than like an inch causes the RPM's to go up without the car going any faster, HOWEVER, in 5th gear at 3k RPM's it does the same thing, but when you drop it down to 3rd, causing it to be closer to 5k RPMs, I can hammer on the gas and the RPMs DONT start to 'slip' or 'go bonkers'. But this does not apply to 5th, higher RPMs do not mean less chance for 'slipping'.",0,1756873856.0,9,mechanic,1757014485,2025-09-03 04:30:56,2025-09-04 19:34:45,"gtiguy12 (Score: 10): Sounds like the clutch is slipping.

Beware, paying a shop to do this could be as much as $2500 I'll say tops. The parts alone they may charge $1500 or so. I did mine myself, took me 6 hours, but I also have access to a hoist and transmission jack. The parts on rockauto cost me $550 shipped. (My current car is a 2016 Elantra, so your prices may differ some). Locally, they wanted $1200 for the same brand clutch, that's not including bearings, flywheel, seals etc. 

You'll need the clutch, pressure plate, flywheel, and any release bearing or other bearings your car may have. If you see any wet spots on the transmission, anticipate new seals too. If your shop is able to resurface the flywheel you may be okay on that one but I replaced mine since I was going in there anyway.  I'd recommend new flywheel to crank bolts as well."

So far I’ve tried it with Honda HDS and Ford FDRS and the performance has been solid. The main differences I noticed compared to my usual mid range scanner are:

It allows programming and reflashing, not just reading or clearing codes.

A stable power supply and internet connection are essential, otherwise failure is a real risk.

The learning curve is steeper, but it provides access to full OEM functions.

For those who use pass-thru tool regularly, do you usually run with a UPS during programming to avoid bricking, or do you just rely on a stable supply?

1n71mww,Remote car starter. Need to know 2 things please. Clutch depress signal and start button contacts. Full explained below.,"CAR: 

2014 Mazda3 manual transmission 

PLAN: 

2 Esp32's. One as transmitter and another as a receiver. I have 2 fobs. The idea is to wire the board to the clutch pedal and push button. It will ""switch on"" the clutch (as though I pressed it) for 3sec and ""pressing"" the start button once. But to prevent theft, a relay will be between the 2nd fob battery and battery contact point which will also be activated. 

So the order each thing will turn on will be key fob relay, clutch, start button. Fob and clutch will be powered for 3sec to give time for the car to read the key and start while the start button will be set to .5 sec as that's all that's needed. 

So my question is the switch for the clutch,l... is it internal in the transmission making it ""impossible"" (without removing the transmission creating a new bigger project) to wire to or is it somewhere external and accessible? I understand manufacturers choose different locations so the exact location may vary. But is it at least external and possibly where would it be? 

The next question is I understand the push buttons aren't quite exactly a standard push button. But is there a main single wire/contact point I can connect to? 

I'd also like to say for those worried about the potential of the car driving itself being a manual.. I never put my car in gear when parked. ONLY when on a hill/incline.. which is rare for me. I almost always just use my parking brake. 

After that last comment, I came up with the idea that assuming this is possible, I can install an accelerometer to deactivate the receiver when it detects x° as a backup for potential start on a hill. And for the remote to be 2 part. 1 button to activate and another to send the transmission. And also either a double or triple press.

\- I had a 2004 Chevy Optra that I put a Compustar remote starter in and I said ""nobody else will ever drive this car"".  It was my winter beater and I kind of bagged on it anyways.  I let my friend try it out and he bagged on it while we went to get pizza.  We were coming out of the store, I hit remote start and suddenly I see the car just hoping.  He parked in gear but thankfully pulled the ebrake.  At first I was trying to figure out what was going on and the remote starter tried to start the car 3 times.  Nobody got hurt and I actually was crying laughing as it looked hilarious.

\- My friend asked me to put a Compustar into his 2003 Chevy Cavalier...  Same thing, it'll only ever be him driving, just leave it in automatic mode.  One day, for whatever reason, he parked it in gear facing his house.  He held the remote start button thinking he left it in neutral and this car already had a high idle issue and he didn't have the ebrake set.  It drove into the deck of his house and when he got outside, the car was doing a full on burnout against the deck.  When he told me, I asked him if he got any video and his response ""yeah right! like I was worrying about video"" lol.  He did it a second time at a walmart trying to open the trunk and mistakenly held the remote start button and it drove into a barricade.  After that, he asked me to switch his into manual mode but not to monitor the passenger door in case he needs to grab something out of the car.  

Just be careful.  I only ever had it once out of the 2 years that I owned the Optra.

1n7lrmr,Is it worth it to change my engine?,"First off, I don't know too much about cars but I know that I really screwed up.

  
I drive a 2010 Toyota Prius with 140k miles on it. I also have in the past realized that when the display to change my oil comes on, it typically can go for a while before actually being low on oil. So, the last time it came on (probably a month ago), I didn't change my oil and continued going about a number of trips I had planned, knowing I needed to change it soon but procrastinating. This past weekend, coming back from a trip (and \~100 miles from home) the check engine light came on and the engine starting making a slight rattling sound that got progressively worse. As soon as I got back I took it to a mechanic who said that there was a leak in my oil tank and that there was quite literally no oil left. He showed me the oil filter, and it was full of metal shards. He replaced the oil but said he wouldn't trust driving it more than back home and maybe very short distances without getting the engine replaced, and that replacing it with a used engine would in total cost around $5000 (at which point I should consider just getting a new car). He said that other things like the transmission should be replaced just because they're old (they're still from 2010) and the tires needed replacing but there was nothing else actively wrong that he could see. 

Does his assessment sound right (both that the engine should definitely be replaced and that $5000 seems realistic) and what would you do in this situation? I like my car and would prefer not to replace it fully but if I would be spending thousands to keep it running for like a year longer then it wouldn't be worth it. What would you do in this situation?",1,1756921798.0,34,AskMechanics,1757014485,2025-09-03 17:49:58,2025-09-04 19:34:45,"inline_five (Score: 9): That light that comes on to ""change your oil"" was the low oil pressure light...

You aren't supposed to wait to change your oil when you are low on oil, you are supposed to change it at regular intervals. Toyota recommends 5k miles for the 3rd gen Prius using synthetic oil. 

Oil especially the 3rd gen Prius should be checked regualrly due to the piston rings getting coaked up with carbon. FWIW I have found Valvoline Restore & Protect 0W20 oil has almost completely eliminated my oil burning issues on my wife's Prius so that it doesn't burn any oil between oil changes (too late for you though). 

If the traction battery is still the original you are likely going to have a failure in that as well, which is around $2k DIY/$3k shop fix. The transmission is actually pretty stout and should last the life of the vehicle.

If there are metal shards in your filter yes your engine is done for.

Disp5389 (Score: 3): Yes, your engine is toast.  

You have a misunderstanding on the “Lights” meanings. 

Most vehicles have two different indicators, one is low oil pressure and one is change oil soon.  Some have a 3rd indicator which is low oil level.  You need to examine your owners manual to determine what indications you have for your vehicle.  

If the Low Oil Pressure indicator comes on (this is probably what you had):  This means PULL OVER NOW onto the shoulder and shut the engine off.  You do not drive a couple of blocks home or to a store where you can buy oil.  You check the oil and if it’s low, you add oil and see if the Low Oil Pressure light goes out when you start the engine.  If you can’t add oil or the indicator stays on - you don’t drive it at all, you get it towed.  

If Low Oil Level comes on, you find the nearest place you can get oil and add oil to the full mark. 

The change oil soon indicator is the only one you can ignore for a few weeks or a few hundred miles, but not more.

Ignore these rules and you can turn a couple of dollars for a quart of oil problem into a blown engine problem."

You will pay a much higher price due to the overhead and you may not be getting the best quality work. Buying tires or getting an alignment from a dealership borders on stupidity.

1n7hn0v,Accelerate Tire Wear?,"So I bought a 2022 Nissan Rogue AWD brand new off the lot that I believe included some Falken tires. Those tires wore out extremely fast. I always got them rotated, although I may have had them slightly underinflated at times, I was never told or noticed that there was uneven wear and my car handled fine, so I assumed they were just cheap tires that I've heard many new vehicles include. At about 21K miles they were getting down to 3/32nds or so, so I got new CrossClimate 2s since I was headed out to Colorado for a few months and wanted to be prepared for all weather.

Yesterday I took my car into a dealership for an oil change and they claimed my new CrossClimates were down to 6/32. I really couldn't believe it. Thankfully I have a digital caliper at home which I used to read an average of about 7.5mm tread depth. According to Michelin the tires started with 10mm, so after 6.5k I've lost a quarter of my tire's tread? That really doesn't seem normal. Like I said, there's never been any mention of uneven tire wear and my car drives straight as an arrow, not pulling to either side at all, so I assume the alignment is fine, or is this a bad assumption?

I wonder if the tires are consistently being under or overinflated. Dealerships and tire shops always inflate them all to the same PSI even though the sticker on the door jamb states the rear tires should be 3 PSI less than the front. I will typically correct this by letting out a small amount of air. I also notice a discrepancy with my physical stick-style pressure gauges and the reading the computer gives me on the dash. I'm not really sure which would be more accurate. Anyway, any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",1,1756912725.0,4,AskMechanics,1757014485,2025-09-03 15:18:45,2025-09-04 19:34:45,"LWschool (Score: 1): That does seem pretty fast.

I have a 2009 Honda Civic FD 1.8L with 120,000 km on it.

Recently, the original A/C compressor seized. I bought a used genuine compressor, condenser, dryer, and expansion valve, and took the car to a garage to have the system flushed, the components installed, and the refrigerant refilled.

I’ve been noticing recently that my car is gently jerking forward repeatedly as I come to a stop. I hadn’t really clued into it happening yet when I got it looked at, so I didn’t bring it up to the mechanics at that time, but it has gotten worse since then. I’m not certain if what I’m feeling fits the description of pulsating brakes that I’ve read about online, since the pedal itself and the steering wheel don’t feel like they’re vibrating.

1n79l52,Blown Head Gasket? Or something else?,"2008 Toyota Avensis, 126000 miles, 2.2 L D4D Diesel, Manual.

I've had this car for around 1 year now, and I've driven quiet a bit with it. I usually do long road trips from Germany to Romania for my studies which is around 1600km from where I live. I noticed after these trips that there is a lot of coolant spraying from my reservoir cap (see first picture). So like you do I went to the mechanic to get it checked out. They replaced the reservoir cap and drove it a few km and said that there is still a small amount of coolant spraying so its probably a head gasket leak big fix big money etc etc... Then I went to a different mechanic to get a second opinion and they also said the same thing. I can't afford to do a head gasket repair for this car... 

So then i decided to some of my own research (I am not a mechanic) and noticed that my car has none of the 'textbook' signs for a head gasket leak, no white smoke from the exhaust, no oil and coolant mixing, No overheating even after long drives, AND (now here comes my question) yes/no exhaust smoke in my coolant. i did the cylinder combustion leak test with a kit  I bought and can't tell if the fluid changed color or not. I did the test for around 20 minutes at my cars operating Temperature. Personally I did not see an obvious change in color but maybe you guys can be the judge of that. Do I have a head gasket leak? Could it be something else? Maybe a problem with my coolant system causing a pressure build up some place else? If i do have a head gasket would K seal help?  Any help would be appreciated thank you in advance.

----

This time last year I bought a red truck off of a guy named Rick. It was going to be just a basic farm truck, nothing special and something I planned on driving around the property maybe once or twice a week at most. Long story short, it had some issues and I felt like Rick didn't honestly disclose those issues upon sale. But, ultimately, I knew that falls on me for not doing my due diligence and whatever, so after asking Rick about the issues I lived with it and moved on.

Eight months later Rick contacts me out of the blue and says that he always felt bad about how that truck transaction went down and ask me if I wanted to trade the red truck for a black truck which runs better and is actually better suited for my purposes. He said the black truck didn't fit him as well since it's not a full size truck and Rick is a pretty large person. He said he also found the red truck easier to work on and this other one just wasn't his style.

I enthusiastically traded and the black truck has been badass and much better for my property. It runs good and despite little quirks here and there, it's been a wonderful truck for me. Four months later, which was this past Saturday, ole Rick reached out again and asked me if I could trade back because his wife misses the black truck and doesn't like the red one. He asked politely and I politely said No Thanks because of what I stated above. He said no problem and wished me well.

I come home today and the truck is gone and I see tire tracks in my grass indicating that it was pulled up onto a flatbed trailer sometime between 9:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. I owned the truck outright but it was as if it was repossessed.

Rick was always a nice guy and I find it completely confounding that he would steal it back, given how distinctive of a truck it is and how it's not really worth a whole lot of money in comparison to the charge of grand theft auto. 

I should note that I live very ruraly at the end of a long driveway and it's not possible to see my house from the road. I don't drive it out and about as I mostly use it for collecting firewood. I also don't have people over very often at all, let alone people who I don't trust. Sitting next to the truck were two vehicles worth several times more than that truck, all of which had keys in them. 

I filed a police report but the cop wasn't very optimistic that anything could be done unless the truck is spotted driving around or  if the license plate that was on the truck is ever spotted by a camera of which there are several around the area. He said he would drive by Rick's place but beyond that, it's a waiting game. 

I've been to Rick's house a couple times because of all this truck swapping bullshit this past year, and similar to me, he lives pretty ruraly and his whole family has houses throughout a pretty deep holler where I figured it'd be easy to hide all kinds of stuff. 


Im mostly feeling paranoid a little bit with lots of expensive woodworking tools within arms reach but it seems like someone is there not for any of my other shit but just for that truck. 

My question is this: does anybody have an idea about how I could proceed here or if I should just write it off as a loss? I feel like getting a camera and pointing it toward his driveway could eventually yield something, but i wouldn't know what kind of camera to get I'm wondering if I'm going about this the wrong way.

I just replaced the alternator in a 2005 Ford 5.4L F250 Superduty. After installation the charging system is now working as expected, but it immediately created a new problem...
Now, when I rev the engine, and after I take my foot off the gas, the RPMs will drop below idle speed. Sometimes it will slowly recover itself back 800 RPMs, other times it will continue to plummet and the truck will die.
This issue wasn't present before the new alternator and battery, so I presume it has something to do with that procedure. I removed the cold air intake box to access the alternator - if not directly correlated, perhaps it has something to do with that?

I recommend finding a good well reviewed transmission repair shop in your area and having them take a look at it and diagnose it.

I’ve been looking at cars and came across an Infiniti Q50 — high spec, listed at £6,700 with 90k miles. My plan would be to put a couple of thousand down and finance the rest. I decided not to go with a more expensive german car as I realise how stupid that would be.

A bit about me:

* I’m 21, working full time, earning about £1,800/month after tax.
* I’m still living with my parents for the foreseeable future, so my outgoings are fairly low.
* Insurance will obviously be on the high side, but I can manage it if it’s not extreme.

My questions:

* Are Q50s reliable and easy to live with in the UK, especially with parts/servicing? Its going to be the mercedes sourced 2.2 diesel. I also know thye disconited all infinit cars in the UK but I am able to travel to Leeds Nissan.
* Is it a sensible buy at this price point, or are there better options for someone in my situation?
* Anything I should look out for when buying one of these used?

Would really appreciate any insight — I don’t see many around, which makes me wonder if I’d be better off with something more common.

1n7u77c,"Car manufacturers sorely underutilize their websites: Comparing UK, US and JP websites and seeing what can be learnt.","**TLDR:** I have unlimited time when I go to a website, and I can come and go as I please. A website is the opportunity for the manufacturer to tell me every reason that has been decided over billions of dollars and thousands of man hours **I** should buy **their** car. I see no reason if I'm spending thousands, why they shouldn't tell me **everything** about their car.

Disclaimer: I am not a UI/UX designer, so my word is not law and these are just things I've noticed in my hours perusing the web. Furthermore, I may be biased in that I've unironically spent more time on Japanese car websites than the UK sites. Feel free to call out these biases or any mistakes in the comments. I'm also terrible at describing so do yourself a favor if you read this and search the sites yourselves (Links below)

Firstly, why am I making this post? Cars are expensive, and even though I've never purchased a new car myself, if I'm paying north of even 10k I absolutely want to know as much as I can about what I'm buying. That's where the mighty website comes in. Instead of trekking to your local dealership and seeing if the car/specification is on the lot, you can instead preview and configure your ideal car to your tastes, as well as read valuable information about your car.

So, I'll try to be a bit fair, but I'm also lazy, so my sample size is limited to US, UK, and Japan (the crux of my post). I'm using the Toyota RAV4 as my sample vehicle.

Originally my post was going to be a deeper analysis but after reviewing the sites I'll cut to the chase. **Japan does it better. My justification? (Please note that I used Google translate for a lot of this)** [**https://toyota.jp/rav4/**](https://toyota.jp/rav4/)

On the Japanese Toyota website there are 7 subheadings when you select the RAV4 which are translated in order: (Translation - URL)  
Design [https://toyota.jp/rav4/design/](https://toyota.jp/rav4/design/)  
Indoor space [https://toyota.jp/rav4/usability/](https://toyota.jp/rav4/usability/)  
Driving performance [https://toyota.jp/rav4/performance/](https://toyota.jp/rav4/performance/)  
Safety performance [https://toyota.jp/rav4/safety/](https://toyota.jp/rav4/safety/)  
Connected [https://toyota.jp/rav4/connected/](https://toyota.jp/rav4/connected/)  
Customized car [https://toyota.jp/rav4/customizecar/](https://toyota.jp/rav4/customizecar/)  
Accessories [https://toyota.jp/rav4/accessory/](https://toyota.jp/rav4/accessory/)

Each section of the site is a short breakdown of every nook, cranny and design choice behind the car. It's as if the engineers themselves poured everything they designed, built and coded into the site, and the site designer cleaned it up in a nice readable (if you can read Japanese) palette, complete with relevant images and info graphics. The design section tells you what you need to know about the exterior, whilst the usability section goes in-depth about everything you'll find inside, from the differing sunroof options of the differing grades to the key to **each individual interior storage cubby** (No need for Doug DeMuro or CarWow here). Performance handles the drive train, suspension, drive modes and the hybrid system capabilities.

The safety section does something great and provides info-graphics for every available safety option that may or may not take control of your car when you or someone else messes up. The accessories and customize section are gold mines too. If you want to see **every** OEM option, package, accessory, part or function (and a few admittedly tacky body kits) you can fit on or in the car before going through the configurator, these sub-pages are for you.

mid writing edit: Just found the section of the site that tells you about [every button and switch in the interior,](https://toyota.jp/function-guide/rav4/?car_grade=phev_Z&tab_index=3) [and every single light in your gauge cluster and what they do.](https://toyota.jp/function-guide/rav4/?car_grade=phev_Z&tab_index=4)

This website is the in-between of the advert you see on TV or reading the brochure, and after you purchase the car and are sitting in finding every function in the owners manual, and this is what is sorely missing in UK and US website design. I love and respect Doug DeMuro, but the manufacturer, **the people who build the car itself** should be obligated tell me about every quirk and feature in the car before I buy it, especially if I'm dropping enough money on a brand new car.

[This is all I get about the interior for the car in the US.](https://preview.redd.it/lroix91w51nf1.png?width=1855&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a11715db3da605acdc099f27b1fbecb08869a57)

In (an admittedly unfair) comparison the [US](https://www.toyota.com/rav4hybrid/) and [UK](https://www.toyota.co.uk/new-cars/rav4-plugin) websites barely scratch the surface of what this car can be. Both are single page scroll downs that tell me nothing that I shouldn't already expect from the car from seeing the adverts. They tell me it has a versatile interior, but they don't tell me the possibilities they envisioned when they designed the car for that purpose. They tell me about the safety tech but don't nearly tell me about the systems that may or may not take control of my car. They tell me that the car performs well but don't go in depth about why their drive train, suspension and structural choices matter to me.  


As a multi billion international company, I know they can do a lot better, because they're already doing it in Japan. Share information, translate what they have in the Japan website. Have a company wide standard for level of detail in your cars. This could single-handedly win sales and make sure people are informed about what they buy beforehand.

Do you have a preference in body styles like Saloon, hatchback, SUV, estate or Coupe? I can make recommendations based on these figures and general question. But to your main question how much is realistic for a first car? Well that’s completely up to you. If you are planning to keep your car as long as it runs and drives then it would be justifiable to spend a little more, however if you want to swap cars every 3-5 years leasing might be a excellent choice as well and like that you can have a relatively low payment and have a brand new car which is still under warranty."

1n7nubj,6 Months Waiting for Part,"First time posting In this subreddit and after some advice if anyone has any. 

Been waiting around 6 months for a part, a loom that’s under warranty and been given a rental whilst I wait. The reason it’s been so long is that it’s a brand new shape / model and parts department have explained that the manufacturers are selling these new models like hot cakes and so basically they have very limited spares as they want the majority to go into the vans that are going out to the dealers for sales. 

Garage has been great with me tbh, they’ve paid for a rental and I’ve just got on with it and then last week the part arrived to be fitted. However it turns out, or so I’ve been told, that the package delivered to the garage was correct but the contents weren’t. 

So now I’m back to square one and not sure if it’s going to be a week or another 6 months waiting for this part. 

Like I said I’ve been generally happy as I’ve gotten something to use to work with and I guess the bonus is that the miles I’ve been doing are going on to a rental van as opposed to mine (roughly 500 miles per week) but it is starting to grate a little bit. 

I bought my van in April 2024 and I took it in for the new loom April 2025 and it’s been MIA ever since. 

Thoughts and advice on what if anything are my options?

Ford have DCT ‘Powershift’ gearboxes. As long as you keep up the maintenance on them with fluid changes they are good even with a 1.0t engine. The second you fall behind on servicing it will drive like crap though. 

Hyundai have a mix of TC and DCT on all but their newest models of i10 and i20. They are absolutely fine and I would recommend basically any model in their range. 

Nissan and Toyota are mostly CVT - Reliable enough and decent performance but they do tend to make a fair bit of noise if you want to make progress. Just avoid the Aygo and older Yaris which are MMT.

1n7fmk0,Advice appreciated re issues with new to us EV purchase,"Hi all 

Not particularly upto speed with Reddit so apologies in advance if I make a mistake.

Bought a new to us 24 year EV from an online only dealer just before the bank holiday. They loudly advertise a 7 day trial approval thing from date of delivery. As they were very busy delivery was booked and made this Monday just gone (1st) and as a bank holdiday deal delivery was free. Company very well reviewed via trust pilot and elsewhere.  Salesperson said the car was in immaculate condition, lots of nice photos and that they'd only had to spend £50 preparing it for sale from original owner. Specifically asked if it had had accident damage, reply was it's HPI clear. Between first enquiring and decision they themselves dropped the price, when I asked why salesman just said it's likely just because they've had it on stock awhile.

Car arrived and typically it was pouring with rain. Couldn't inspect much at all but interior was lovely. Rain stopped after a few hours and a large, raised stone chip seen on the bonnet. Emailed dealer Monday, who called back and basically said it's a chip that's been badly touched in but it is what it is and they wouldn't do anything about it. First little 🟥 flag. Yesterday was dry, so I had a more thorough inspection, I'm just a layperson but noticed over spray on two window trims and a scratch over one of the camera, in the glass outer trim. Scratch is light and doesn't appear to be visible on the feed from the camera inside the car. Have emailed the dealer last night but no response as yet. Had another look and there's also over spray inside the door handle reccesses on the same side.

I'm inclined to reject the car, the poor chip repair alone has me questioning it, but the over spray suggests to me it's had a respray, and poorly done.   No idea why it's been sprayed, or of there's filler or the standard of any repairs etc. Considering the poorly done repaint on an ~18th premium vehicle has me concerned about the standards of any repairs and regardless of such, the impact of it on its value. Dealer is about 90mins away and pre purchase they said if we rejected we'd have to pay to have it collected or return it ourselves.

Appreciate thoughts on the above. ",1,1756908053.0,28,CartalkUK,1757014485,2025-09-03 14:00:53,2025-09-04 19:34:45,"tabletmctablet (Score: 5): ""Immaculate condition"" the dealer said.

That alone should be enough to reject it, but then there is overspray on the window trim? Pardonmesorrywhat? 

I think salesperson needs to learn what immaculate means, and you need to reject a possibly crash damaged/repaired car.

Whilst driving to work, an oncoming van went around a parked car on his side of the road, and came too close to me which caused him to hit my wing mirror with his wing mirror.

Whilst his wing mirror was fine, the glass on my wing mirror was smashed. On top of that, the wing mirror glass has fallen out of the housing, and the plastic that connected it to the motors to rotate the mirror is broken, so according to the AA guy, I will need to replace the whole mirror.

He isn't willing to pay me the cost of the wing mirror, its a Lexus rx450h mk3 so its relatively expensive, at least £200. 

What should I do? I believe it was his fault because I had right of way, but I have £500 excess on my insurance and he may just deny what happened.

I have photos of my car after hitting him, and the street it occurred on at the time of the accident, so you can clearly see that on the oncoming way, there were parked cars, and hence he had to go out of his lane and unfortunately came too close to me.

Revs rising when pressing in the clutch is to do with the fact there's a lot of load on the engine since it's spinning the gears and the wheels etc, suddenly that resistance is removed and the revs go up a little bit. All you have to do is hold the clutch in a tad longer when upshifting as you wait for the revs to drop.

RejectedIdeas (Score: 8): Firstly all Toyotas are a good choice so either are not bad cars. If the choice is purely between these 2 then it would depend on which auto gearbox the Corolla has. The Auris has the Multimode, which is not a particularly good auto, it is more of a clutchless manual with an automatic shift between the gears. If the Corolla has Multimode then there really is little difference apart from the Corolla has lower mileage but the Auris has much better trim. However, if the Corolla has Multidrive then it is a much better car. As many have said they are both going to be expensive to insure and an Aygo will be cheaper but again will have the Multimode transmission. Your budget probably does not run to a Yaris hybrid which would give you a better gearbox and the earlier non hybrids are most likely equipped with Multimode. I can suggest a slightly rarer alternative which is the Toyota IQ, the auto versions have Multidrive and the engines are the 1.0 from the Aygo or the 1.3 from the Yaris. They do hold their value though, so you may perceive that an Aygo is better for the price but the IQ is an amazing, little, ultra reliable car."

I have a Skoda Fabia mk2 and I have fitted an aftermarket stereo. I am having the issue where the stereo does not power on/off with the ignition which I have heard is because the red/yellow power cables need switching around. 

I also saw a forum though with a few people with mk2 fabias saying it might not be possible to do this, as there is only one type of cable so switching them doesn't make a difference. 

I noticed on the back of the harness adaptor, there's a red and yellow cable, but on the other side (the wires coming from the car) these are all red. 

Any ideas if this will still work? Should I go ahead and switch these round on the harness adaptor?

Spraying the paint on is \~5% of the work.  Like any paint job, 95% of the finish is in prep work.

Basically, it's got to be flat to get a good job.  This may need filler if it's like a millimetre deep scratch.  If it's not a deep scratch then you can get away with several coats of high build primer which you might as well paint on from a bottle rather than spray in.  Basically you should deliberately add too much, and then when it's dry sand it down so that it forms a completely flat surface.  You want very fine paper for sanding; as in \~500 grade to start with to get it flat, moving up to stuff in the thousands to perfect the finish.

As a guideline spend about ten times longer doing the sanding as you think you need to.  It wants to be as indistinguishable from the area around it as humanly possible.  If you can close your eyes and run your fingers over the area that you've done and not tell where it is then your done.

The quality of the job that you did with the filler/primer/sanding will determine the quality of the job with the spray paint/lacquer.  Shake the can vigorously for as long as is recommended before you start.  Spraying from like 10cm which will cause paint to drip and look awful.  

Start spraying from a great distance ie a half meter and get closer ie 30-40cm until your a bit more than barely putting paint on.  Do several thin coats and leave to dry between until it's matched in with the surrounding area and then add the lacquer.  The same applies to spraying on lacquer as the paint; start from a distance and put small amounts on.

You don't want it to drip, because then you've basically got to do the whole job again and sanding is horribly tedious."

Anything else she should consider and anything to avoid? I won't have a Juke because of the cvt gearbox and she wants a petrol car",0,1756882523.0,117,CartalkUK,1757014485,2025-09-03 06:55:23,2025-09-04 19:34:45,"disgruntledarmadillo (Score: 13): Ford Kuga is least hateful of those

m4r71n2010 (Score: 11): An Evoque at that price is going to be awful so avoid that straight away. 

I like the 500x myself but like the nissan juke they aren't as big inside as they appear due to the shape of them.

Honda hrv or Toyota RAV4 could be reliable buys. Not sure if they sneak under 10k but a ch-r wouldn't be bad, but again the interior space is compromised by the spaceship shape they gave the car.

1n75f18,New driver,"Planning to buy automatic yaris year 2014-2016. Budget 6-8k. Is yaris a good option for this price point? 

Note: the specs I’m really looking for are
-small-average size of car
-automatic
-low road tax
-bluetooth and rear cam

The insurance quote I got for yaris are ranging from 1.2-1.4k 

Will mainly use car for commuting to work and shopping. Maybe a trip to country side 1-2x a year.",2,1756873798.0,3,CartalkUK,1757014485,2025-09-03 04:29:58,2025-09-04 19:34:45,"Ok-Alfalfa288 (Score: 2): Pretty much as cheap as cars go to run. Don't need to spend 6-8k though

weirdchili (Score: 1): Yeah, pretty much bulletproof. Just check the service history, even if some services are missing, the engine is pretty solid

pinkyandthebrain-ama (Score: 1): I'd say yes.  The pros are that they're bulletproof drivers. Hardly anything goes wrong with them and they're easy to drive, insure and maintain.  

The cons are that they're not the best on economy and these felt dated when they were new. 

If you can live with that, they're a great first choice."
