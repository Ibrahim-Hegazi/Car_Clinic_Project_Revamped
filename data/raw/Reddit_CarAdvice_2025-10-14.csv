Hi all,

Asking again and keeping it simple. Title says it in a nutshell. Trying to replace this into engine but the rotation always end up wrong after proper torque, and won't reach the mini hose needed.

Service manual indicates to  
\- ""tighten valve to 11 lbf-ft""  
\- ""*then* turn the valve joint toward the mark""  
  
I have seen elsewhere that this could compromise the unit, but the manual seems clear.  No where else have I seen it as a two-step, only that twisting the plastic vs. brass (should be) bad. I have gone through two of these now, going to try a third (36281-RAA-A01 Honda Air assist valve).

I realize the community knowledge here and common sense may be thinking it is obvious, but not to me anyway.

1o5ziau,battery or parasitic draw?,"1999 honda civic 

I went to drive my car the other day, but wouldn't start (drove it the night before). Gave it a jump and it started up immediately, drove around for a bit to let the alternator charge the battery.

A couple days later, tried to start it up and no luck. Multimeter tool read 11.9 v on the battery. jumped it, and it started up easily. when running, multimeter read 14.2 v so alternator should be fine. 

I picked up a new battery and just before putting it in (about 2 hours later), I checked the old battery and it was at 12.45 v.  this car has some electrical gremlins sometimes so not sure if its a parasitic draw instead of bad battery.

-Funeral_party- (Score: 1): Based on the symptoms and finding a loose roll pin, the loose pin is almost certainly the cause of your shifting issues. However, you will need to open the transmission deeper to re-secure the pin. 
Why you have to open it deeper
The roll pins in the TR3650 are responsible for securing the shift forks to their corresponding shift rails. These pins tend to fatigue and shear over time. 
The roll pin you found likely came from the 3-4 shift fork, which is the culprit for your sloppy 3-4 movement and the lockout.
With the pin sheared, the fork no longer moves with the shift rail, leading to the gear lockout you experienced.
Since the roll pin sits deep inside the transmission to hold the fork onto the rail, you will need to disassemble the trans. 

Remove the tailshaft housing. This is the first step in gaining access to the internal shifting mechanism.
Separate the case halves. The internal components, including the shift rails and forks, are exposed by splitting the transmission case.
Locate the shift rails. You will find three main shift rails inside the transmission: one for 1st-2nd, one for 3rd-4th, and one for reverse.
Identify the sheared pin. Examine the 3-4 shift fork and rail assembly to see where the pin has sheared off.
Remove all three roll pins. As a standard practice when rebuilding this transmission, you should remove all three pins from the shift rails—for 1st-2nd, 3rd-4th, and reverse.
Pull out the shift rails. With the roll pins removed, you can pull the shift rails up and off the forks.
Remove the shift forks. You can now remove the forks, which will allow you to replace the broken pin and inspect for any other damage. 

While you have the transmission apart, it is highly recommended to replace the weak factory roll pins with stronger, aftermarket versions to prevent a recurrence. You should also consider replacing the stock plastic shift fork pads with more durable billet bronze pads, as the original plastic pads are known to crumble and contaminate the transmission."

1o5xnlc,"Weird situation, Change Trans Fluid?","I have a 2018 Toyota Camry LE with 237,000 miles on it. I bought the car in 2022 at 70,000 miles.

I drive a lot of miles for a veterinary courier company and while I’ve been religious with my oil changes, one of my favorite clients while I was personal training told me that you don’t have to change your transmission fluid, and I listened. (I know I was young.)

Overall, the car runs great, but I’ve noticed in the mornings. I hear a groaning sound when I accelerate and it feels a little bit jumpy, all of that goes away after running the car for a bit. 

Because of this I considered doing a drain and fill, but I cannot afford to replace the transmission if something were to go wrong because of it. 

My question is since I’ve already put so many miles on the car and I’m already starting to notice what could be the start of some issues, would it sound and feel better with a drain and fill or should I just ride it until the wheels fall off? 

Any advice or personal experiences are appreciated thank you

If you have no easy way to check or add fluid, i would just ride it til the wheels fall off. Transmission services (drain and fill) tend to exacerbate problems if the fluid hasnt already regularly been changed.


If fluid is low, i would check it to make sure its not leaking.

1o5x9iu,Front sway bar bolt or nut broke - what to do now?,"2013 Toyota Tundra 5.7L 4x4 Crewmax Platinum

In process of replacing the alternator, which is in a very tight spot. Figured I'd get some extra space to work with so I started trying to remove as much stuff around it as I could. Got to the sway bar and the first bolt (back one holding the bar to the frame, not the links) I tried to remove, either the bolt or nut broke. Doing some quick research, it seems like the nut is attached inside the frame, and this is a somewhat common issue especially due to rusting. The bolt now just spins in place in either direction; it doesn't come out or fasten back in. I'm glad there's still at least one bolt holding it in place, but...

Is fixing this an immediate necessity? Or is it safe to drive around for a while?

What would be the best way to go about fixing this issue?

Anyway.. see if you can get a wrench through one of the frame holes above to hold the nut. If you can take if off that way, you can put it back on that way(the right way is to tack-weld the nut back onto the frame there, but I'm guessing that's outside your tool/capability range).

Yes, that's a very important part to get fixed. There are (perhaps many) hundreds of pounds of force on that bracket, and one bolt isn't going to hold it very long."

1o5vo2u,Durango 5.7L Hemi Lifter swap or lifter/cam?,"Hey guys,

I suspected a light lifter tick and my local guy took a listen today and said he agrees. The tick is not always noticeable and from what my mostly unknowledgeable self can tell, this problem just became apparent. It really is not bad at all yet, I don't think. I have found videos of much worse. I want to be smart about how I proceed so that my repair is easier and the engine does not fill with metal eventually.

I have read all sorts of stuff on using Redline oil and going a bit thicker. Local guy also said that if it were him, he would change the oil from 5W20 to 5W30 and continue driving like normal. Thing is though, I cant afford a catastrophic failure so that seems out of the question as much as I would like that to be the case- I would really welcome opinions about his logic, because my mind wants that to be an easy solution. lol. I just do not want to mask the noise if damage is still happening.

  
However.. this shit is expensive. Between the delaminating radio screens, failing race tracks lights, water pumps failing, and all the other things that happen with this vehicle, cash has admittedly become tighter than I would like and I need to tackle this repair myself.

**TLDR:** Suspect a lifter tick. Any thoughts on simply changing out the lifters instead of lifters/cam? How long does it take for a lifter tick on these to progress, or the cam to start releasing a lot of metal, not sure how urgent? Fresh noise. Trying to avoid going broke. New car is more, yes. Do not plan to grenade car. Would be nice to save a grand in parts (cam/hellcat pump) and scary labor. Does not sound like injector.

I took my 2011 Nissan Sentra to Mr.Lube to have the spark plugs replaced because the plugs were starting to show signs of dying(not the place I should have gone, I learned my lesson). They changed my plugs and off I went. That same day, my engine was misfiring again, but it got scary after about a week and my check engine light came on. 

I took it to a legit shop who said the wrong spark plugs were installed. Mr.Lube used LKAR6AIX-11 Plugs. Which their system based it off of the NGK website. However, my vehicle has an MR20DE engine, which according to it's SDS needs PLZKAR6A-11 plugs, the platinum. I'm in Canada, and the Canadian manual says to use platinum, the American says to use Iridium(for the QR25DE engine). 

So it looks like the iridium plugs Mr.Lube installed burnt out an engine coil and lead to costly repairs. I'm in a big fight with Mr.Lube to get reimbursed for them using incorrect spark plugs. They are refusing to reimburse me because the website says the spark plugs they used are compatible with the year, make, and model I drive(but don't say for which engine). From my research, the plugs they used are for the American high performance engine, which is not the one in my car. 

I need some help or something I can provide to Mr.Lube to show them that they used the wrong spark plugs. I provided them with the shops report, a photo of the Canadian manual saying platinum plugs, and my engines SDS. They are still saying they did nothing wrong because NGK says it is correct for that type of car.

I’m from Germany and I own a 2008 Chrysler Sebring JS with the 2.0L gasoline engine (150 HP) – basically the same platform as the Dodge Avenger or Caliber in the US.

This car originally belonged to my grandfather, and I’ve had it ever since he passed it down to me. It’s in great shape overall, and I really don’t want to give up on it — but I’ve been struggling with one persistent issue I just can’t fix.

The problem: I keep getting a P0420 “Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold” even though the catalytic converter and both O2 sensors (upstream and downstream) have already been replaced.

Here’s what I’ve done and checked so far: 
•	Both sensors are reading values, and the upstream behaves normally (fast switching). 
•	The downstream sensor, however, still fluctuates too much instead of showing a stable signal — the ECU keeps thinking the cat isn’t working properly. 
•	Wiring and connectors are clean, no corrosion or shorts. 
•	No exhaust leaks before the cat. 
•	Engine runs smooth, no misfires, fuel trims are within normal range.

At this point, I’m wondering if: 
•	The aftermarket catalytic converter I installed simply doesn’t meet Chrysler’s efficiency threshold, or 
•	There’s an ECU calibration issue, since the European GEMA version is pretty rare and info is hard to find.

Has anyone seen similar behavior with these engines (Sebring / Avenger / Caliber 2.0L GEMA)? Would using an O2 spacer help?

Any advice or experience would be really appreciated — I’d love to keep this car on the road in honor of my grandpa.

1o5snga,"I think my mechanic broke my AC blower, they disagree","2018 Toyota Prius Two, 8th VIN digit U.

Last week I brought a recently-purchased used Prius to my usual car shop for them to look over and tell me about any problems they found. I had been driving the car for most of a month by this point, and the blower had been working great.

They told me their checks had gone fine, but that the cabin air filter had been disgusting. They showed me a picture of it covered in leaves, twigs, and stains. However, the filter they had was the wrong size, so we agreed that I would come back this week to take care of it. They cleaned up the old filter and put it back in.

When I got in the car to drive away, a loud thumping and shaking came from the area under the right side of the dashboard. I could see that area, and the glove box too, shuddering from the vibrations. I turned off the car and went back inside, asked them for help. One of their guys came out and opened up the glove box. I wanted to show him what it had been doing, so while he was working he said ""yeah, turn it on and let's see what it does."" The thumping and vibrations resumed, and he removed the cover panel and replaced it. The thumping stopped.

We thought that was it, so I went back in, thanked them, and went to drive away. However, now the AC wasn't working at all. When I brought the car back again, they pulled the blower out, fed it power, and it would not work. I asked them to cover the cost of replacing the blower, but the lead told me they can't, citing that the air filter and its tray don't obstruct the blower's space, so any mistake they may have made with the filter or cover couldn't have broken the blower. They told me that the part must have broken on its own.

Edit: the guys told me that when they removed the blower to test it, there was no debris in the cage. I guess that might be true, might not.

I was aghast. I have been a routine customer with these guys for years, and they had always been trustworthy and reliable. The part obviously broke under their care, so I can't understand why they would say otherwise.

Now when I try to turn on the AC I can hear the blower motor trying to turn, but it can't. It makes those little ""vrrr vrrr"" noises, but no airflow from the AC. I infer that it suffered some sort of mechanical break during the thumping and shaking, or possibly while it was running at the same time that the tech took the cover panel off.

I'm going to go back to talk to the owner, but before I go I want to be able to make my case clearly. Can you help me understand what probably happened that made my blower go from working fine, to thumping, to not working at all?

There's no guarantee how long it could stay like that (honestly, could be a couple weeks or it could be a year or more) so it wouldn't be advised to ignore it for long or take it on any long trips, but normal daily driving would be fine.

A lot of shops would want to just replace both, which really isn't necessary. Sure, they might have the same number of miles on them, but I'm guessing you don't have a counter of how many potholes you've hit on either side or anything else. So they're helping you save some money and replace only what's necessary.

If you'd rather the peace of mind and can afford it, you could ask them to replace both sides (assuming they can at least tell it's front or rear by the noise).

For anyone to help diagnose it here, we would need more information, and still wouldn't be able to say with certainty. How loud is the noise, and can you place it anywhere specific relative to the drivers seat? Have you ridden anywhere else in the vehicle to compare how it sounds? Do you notice it get louder or quieter on turns when the weight of the vehicle shifts to one side or the other? Did either of the two people who looked at it check it for noise with the vehicle on a lift?

Typically, the bearing gets louder when weight is shifted onto it (e.g. on a right turn/bend, weight shifts to the left, a bad bearing on the driver side will get louder or one on the passenger side might stop making noise altogether). This is not always the case, but can be confirmed by checking each wheel while on a lift. If a bearing does get louder with weight off of it, it may be quite noticeable when spinning the wheel by hand (depending on the condition of the brakes, it might help to have the wheel and brakes removed to spin just the hub).

If the noise is loud/bad, even without play and if it can't be confirmed on a lift, it would probably be a safe bet to replace the side which gets louder under load. If the noise is pretty faint and there is no play, that might be more cause to wait for it to get louder before doing anything, because all signs point to it being a minimal issue currently (just be smart, keep monitoring, don't drive across country or anything). Or, again, for peace of mind, pay for both sides to be replaced, but it's not like your wheel is going to come flying off next week.

1o5n3l1,Need Help - 2022 Mazda CX-5 Grinding Noise,"I have tried to take my car to different shops and can't find a solution. Bought a used Mazda from Carmax and the brakes started to make a weird high pitched noise. Went back to Carmax and they replaced the brake pads only. Then the vehicle started making a grinding/dragging noise, took it back and they replaced all brake pads as well as the rotors. After a couple of months, the grinding/dragging noise came back and Carmax said its outside of their warranty. Took it to a Mazda dealership and they claim because the pads are aftermarket its not working properly and so it's wearing out very fast and causing the noise... I am not sure where to go with this.

The noise comes when the car sits idle for a while. I have tried to capture the noise on camera but haven't gotten luck. It sounds like the brakes are being held on to something until it eventually lets go and the car runs fine. At stop signs, or at any point when the car is on brake, it again makes a grinding/dragging noise. If anyone can give me some kind of idea, I would appreciate it. The noise is very noticeable when it rains, or if I go through a car wash.

That’s what I’m wondering too — **how do I know if I have a leak?** I park in a driveway and haven’t noticed any major puddles or spots on the ground, so I’m confused. Also, my dad (who helped me add the fluid) didn’t mention anything about leaks, so now I’m wondering if maybe he just didn’t notice or if it’s possible for fluid to get super low without an obvious leak?

So, I bought a Volvo XC90. It’s super safe, comfortable, all that...but oh wow that car is boring to drive.

1o5ok6n,Weird noise update 2013 Lexus gs350,"Posted in here last night about my 2013 Lexus gs350 making a weird noise, and I may have been barking up the wrong tree entirely. I went ahead and changed the idler pulley as I was already kicking myself for not doing it when I changed the belt but it wasn’t looking necessary. Old pulley definitely has some grit and wobble, but nothing crazy. Of course when I fired it up again the noise was still there although a little less vibration with the new one. Since I had the belt of I went ahead and felt all of the pulleys, and the water pump and crankshaft both feel solid, but the ac compressor seems to have a slight click back and forth when applying a bit of pressure, again nothing crazy, and my ac has been working fine albeit slightly noisy in the cabin when turning on which I’ve heard to be common with these cars, due to the actuators having issues. At this point I was a bit stumped so turned it on and took a socket extension and put the female end to my ear, and tapped around to see where it was mainly coming from and it’s like it’s inside the valve cover behind the alternator. Took it to my family mechanic and he said the same sounded like the alternator or under the valve cover. I’m hoping not the injectors, but it’s carrying up through the fuel line that enters the drivers side of the valve cover, though I can’t hear anything on the rim of the topside injectors other than the typical clicking.

TLDR: 2grfse engine in 2013 Lexus gs350 making wobbly/metallic noise from inside/under valve cover, behind alternator. Belt, alternator, and idler pulley are new. Tensioner spring feels normal and pulley spins smooth with no play, ac compressor pulley has very slight play, but no AC pulley exclusive symptoms, no check engine codes, or majorly noticeable performance change other than a very very slight fluctuating rpm at idle. Plugs were also changed just by schedule after issue started and ofc no change.

First being is it makes an annoying sound when in gear and in motion. It’s audible in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, 1st gear being the loudest and I hope this noise is fixable without a costly repair. It also makes this sound while engine braking. Second issue is that it’s been getting more difficult to shift from 1st, to 2nd, and to 3rd, 4th-6th gear are all good. It’s “notchy” in the lower gears, I need to apply additional force to shift or else it’ll take way too long for it to shift. Sometimes when I try to go from 1st to 2nd as I’m trying to get out of 1st gear even with the clutch pedal fully depressed the shifter is still extremely stiff as if I’m trying to shift without a clutch pedal but eventually after 1-2 seconds of having the clutch pedal down and trying to get out of 1st it comes out and I’m able to go into 2nd. I’m convinced the clutch in my car is possibly at the end of its lifespan. Assuming it’s never been serviced it’s probably time to service it. But it could also be that my transmission is cooked(which I’m hoping that’s not what it is), I myself have bled the hydraulic system out and made sure there was no air in the lines that could possibly be causing the clutch disc from not fully disengaging. I also installed brass linkage bushings and a short throw shifter. The idea was to kind of make the shifts a bit more efficient, it somewhat worked. It’s also got new MTF I put the Redline MT-LV GL-4 fluid in it. I’ve tried everything that I thought could possibly fix it without removing the transmission from the car. To me it’s strange that my car acts like this. I’ve driven other manual cars and they shift way better than mine and don’t make that annoying sound i mentioned earlier.

1o57ccy,Bad O2 sensor?,"2007 Nissan Xterra, 120k miles.

I have a p300 code and a flashing engine light (so a bad misfire) at startup with high idle RPM. Because I bought the car only a few thousand miles ago, I decided to replace spark plugs first. This seemed to fix the issue for a month or so, then it came back. Since then, I have replaced:
- Ignition coils
- Valve cover due to spark plug seal oil leak
- Valve cover gaskets
- All the vacuum / intake manifold lines
- Cleaned the MAF with MAF cleaner

After the ignition coils changed, it ran very smooth for a day, with normal rpms, then back to misfire. 

Here are some symptoms / points to note:
- The long term fuel trim on bank 2 is consistently -10
- The short term fuel trim on bank 2 is consistently negative, from -10 to -15. During the misfire -25. 
- Bank 1 is near 0 on both short and long term fuel trim
- I checked the fuel injectors while doing the other work and the o-rings were intact, and I didn't see any pooling gas. In theory, one could be stuck open though?
- When the car is off, the bank 1 upstream 02 is .45V and bank 2 upstream o2 is .9V
- When I started the car, the bank 2 stayed at 0.9V for a second, then jumped straight to 0V and stayed there, and it started to misfire (flashing check engine), so I turned it off.

Can you bench test spray pattern of the fuel injectors? You could rule out any streaking or leaking. However a new coil wouldn't have affected anything were that the case.

ECM is trying to pull back on fuel because it's seeing a rich mix after combustion. I think O2 is probably working correctly, detecting fuel from a cylinder that is missing spark. I would swap in a known good coil & see what happens.

ChatGPT helped me create a Python script to read only the RPMs for a start, and that works perfectly in the terminal.
After that, we also made several scripts to send the data through a TCP server to RealDash — but that part doesn’t work.

I’ve tried different test scripts just for RPMs to at least get something to show up in RealDash, but without success.

The clicking you are hearing is likely the starter solenoid.  When you twist your key, electricity flows from the battery to the solenoid, which closes (click), allowing lots of current to flow to the starter.  Your tired battery can't supply enough current to the starter, so the voltage drops and solenoid opens.  The battery no longer sees the starter load, so the voltage jumps up, the relay closes (click) and the battery is connected to the starter...which causes the voltage drop and solenoid to open...rinse and repeat several times a second.  

TLDR--start with your battery. If the jump start works, get the battery tested (and probably replaced).  If you are a DIYer and a Costco member, their battery prices are better than any auto parts store IMO."

He cleaned a considerable amount of rust off the hub with a wire brush, but this is what the rust currently looks like on the driver’s side. He took everything apart and cleaned it, then reinstalled multiple times on both sides. Issue persisted. He also replaced the two crossthreaded studs visible in pics, still no fix. Also tried putting the old rotor back on, still no change. 

I took it to Firestone this morning and they first said they didn’t see anything wrong, that the brakes likely needed to set in more. But when I asked about the shaking, they drove the car again and then told me the brand new rotors were both warped yet couldn’t tell me the runout or anything, so I don’t think they actually checked.

This morning I got jumper cables connected to it and got it cranked. I backed it out and moved to another spot and backed it in to be able to access it easier later today. I then drove my GFs car to work and didn’t get back to it until this afternoon.

*One thing to note is that NO car lights will come on, but once you connect cables the lights will come on*

This afternoon I get cables connected to it and I let them sit for 10 minutes. I then go to crank it and it won’t start. I know the cables are connected because the lights are coming on. I then try to crank it again in a few minutes and it takes a good 10 seconds, and a few very unpleasant sounds, and the car starts. Although it starts, it only stays on for about 1 second before turning it self off with the key still in the ignition turned on.

My assumption is the alternator is bad, but how can I be certain? How do I know the battery just didn’t become so dead that it can’t be trickled high enough through jumpers?

-Front brake pads and rotors were replaced by me 2 years ago

1o5vkxh,Did I screw this up?,"So, last week my car, a 2005 Camry 3.0 had a little squeal when I first started it up, then it went away. Later that morning I started again, and the battery light was on, and there was a whirring noise that fluctuated with engine RPM. I assumed my alternator had failed, and took it straight home and replaced it. All good for two days. Then the whirring noise came back. No lights this time. And the cold start squeal. I naturally assumed that I'd screwed up the belt tension, and adjusted it. No dice. I also tried slightly tighter and slightly looser than (I think) it should be. Still no change. It's two belts. One for the alternator and AC compressor I believe, and another that I assume drives the water pump and power steering, although I can only see one other pulley. AC and power steering seem fine, and temperature seems normal, but the squeal may be the first time I touch the steering wheel? I'll need a couple more cold starts to confirm that. I can see maybe the AC compressor starting to fail and causing some belt slip on the shared alternator belt triggering the battery light? It seems like an awfully big coincidence for two belt driven accessories to fail within a week. Both belts look ok visually. There is a bit of a temperature smell, and the alternator is hot to the touch.

I was told it could be an ignition switch since it doesn’t start in the start position, but tries when it releases to the run position. And I replaced that which was $100. That did not work. I also replaced the fuel pump relay which was another $28. But neither of those solved the issue.

It still has problems if I let it sit for too long and then try to start it. If I keep it started frequently, it has no problems starting up at all.

https://images.tirebuyer.com/visual-aids/pages/education/tire-anatomy-and-construction/anatomy.webp

Your tire is, essentially, a sandwich made of rubber, synthetic fabric, steel fabric, and more rubber. The fabric plies are fused into the rubber, and these materials are what give the tire its strength. Without them, the tire would just inflate like a balloon.

Have you ever tried to tear a t-shirt? If the cloth is fully intact, it’s not that easy. Now cut a small hole in the shirt and try again. All of the sudden the shirt shreds easily.

That’s what happens when you get a puncture like this. The bolt tears a hole in the “fabric” embedded in the tire, which makes it much easier to tear.

The problem is, you can’t know when that is going to happen. It might be fine for hundreds of miles, and then boom, the whole tire goes all at once. Then again, it might develop a massive bubble, at which point you know it’s fucked.

That’s why shops won’t repair anything close to the sidewall. If those plies get torn near the edge, they’re more likely to tear all the way across."

It's responsible for many tasks. One of these tasks is to check how fast your engine (engine coolant) warms up. It uses your RPMs, coolant temp and ambient temp readings to estimate when your car is supposed to reach the normal operating temperature. When your car fails to reach the target fast enough, PCM throws a P0128 code and you are supposed to figure out why.

* Very often, your thermostat stuck open, partially open, or opens sooner than required.
* Not often, you are low on coolant and your coolant sensor measures the air gap temp.
* Less often, your water pump doesn't work for some reason, or there's a clogged coolant passage, and your coolant temp sensor measures the temperature of the liquid that doesn't flow through the engine.
* Less often, ambient temp sensors or coolant temp sensors report garbage readings, which alter PCM calculations.
* Rarely, your thermostat temp rating is lower than your OE temp rating (wrong thermostat).

Your task is to check coolant and ambient temp readings on your dash or on your scan tool. Make sure they are not odd. Then find a video on youtube that explains how to check if your thermostat stuck open or opens sooner than required. Make sure your engine doesn't overheat while you are testing other components.

1o5pvve,Update: My car stopped moving in Drive — turns out all it needed,"Update: My car stopped moving in Drive — turns out all it needed was transmission fluid


Just wanted to share an update because this might help someone else.

Yesterday, I brought my 2014 Hyundai Elantra into the garage with my dad after it suddenly wouldn’t move in Drive (but would still go in Reverse). It had thrown a **P0722 code** — “Output Speed Sensor No Signal” — so I thought something major broke.

We opened up the transmission and ended up adding about **5–6 bottles of transmission fluid**, and to our surprise, the car started working again immediately. As soon as we shifted into Drive, it moved perfectly fine!

I’m kind of mad now because a few months ago, I asked my mechanic if I should change my transmission fluid, and he told me *“nah, not necessary if you’re getting regular oil changes.”* Clearly that was bad advice.

So for anyone out there — **don’t skip your transmission fluid changes.** Make it a priority every **40–50k miles**. Otherwise, you could end up like me — stuck in a parking lot, unable to move forward at all, just lucky I was in a spot where a tow truck could’ve reached me if needed.

Now that the car runs fine and the **check engine light went away**, I’m wondering — is there anything else I should check or replace after this happened? Just want to make sure nothing else got damaged when it ran low on fluid.

1o5ffkc,What creates the initial pressure in a variable car AC compressor?,"Hi, hopefully this won't be too abstract, but I think anyone who knows AC compressors should be able to understand.

From what I've understood from various videos and explanations, a variable piston AC compressor alters the angle of the swashplate within to vary the piston travel and thus the compression rate according to the needs of the AC system. 

What varies the swashplate angle is a solenoid which opens and closes the path between the low pressure and high pressure chambers, the difference in pressure between these two chambers is what determines the swashplate angle.

What I don't understand is how is the swashplate angled from its initial state when the car and AC systems first start and there is no compression generated before that? 
Like when the swashplate isn't angled at all, but is in idle and just spins without moving the pistons, what creates the initial pressure that is needed to change the angle of the swashplate and start compressing the gas?
Or is the swashplate not in idle when the car is started, but always creates a little bit of compression?",2,1760349100.0,4,AskMechanics,1760470505,2025-10-13 09:51:40,2025-10-14 19:35:05,"Fieroboom (Score: 2): It's always at least slightly angled - even a fraction of a degree is enough to build pressure.

This hose isnt available anymore and i cant find it anywhere. But i found the same hose only the version with 3 exits and not 4 (the one going to the heater is missing).

Let me start by saying this is NOT for any illicit purposes and if I truly wanted to siphon a car i would do it the old fashioned way.

So the only option to drain empty is through the lid at the top.. So a garden hose is put in through the top & drops down into the bottom of the tank inside.

2011 Honda Odyssey. About 120k miles. We bought it a year ago (third owners).

Question: Is my van's problem related to the crash or is it an unrelated, unfortunate travel day?

On our travels home, we were in a fender bender when a pickup truck tapped our back bumper. It's hardly noticeable but the trunk wouldn't open post crash. Did the police report and all that. Went on our merry way. After 45 minutes of driving, the van started driving ""bumpy"" for lack of better words, making sounds (sounded similar to a quieter motorcycle), and the check engine light started flashing. I pulled over and had it towed the other 50 miles home.

Maybe relevant?
Three times in the last few months, the engine light and TMPS light have seemingly randomly come on, together. They stay on for 2-3 days and then turn off. 
Autozone's scanner said ""cylinder 3 misfire detected"" and both of the gentlemen helping (different stores, separate occasions) seemed like it was no biggie.

That's because it's not true. At home, you will charge with a type 2 connector(usually max 7.2kW). Out 'n' about you might be able to use high speed chargers if the car has a CCS connector. If not, you just use Type 2(often 22kW) while you're out n about.

I am looking for some help in choosing between a newer Fiat 500 1.0 and an older Mini 3 door hatch. New to the UK, I just got my full driving licence. I love the design of both cars. We are a small family with no kids and one cat, so a small car suits are our needs. Actually, we are actively looking for a ""super-mini"".

  
I'd say that my requirements are - 

* I don't travel for work so I anticipate around 5000 miles of annual mileage for social trips
* Live in a city in south-west so most of the trips would be around town or grocery runs. Slightly longer trips would be through the country lanes to national parks or the coast for walks and hikes.
* Maybe 3-4 inter city trips annually to explore this beautiful country - we have not been to Scotland yet, would love to visit.
* May need to move away from the UK in a couple of years so a the car with slightly better resale value would be better.

With a budget of £10K, these are the two categories we have shortlisted so far:

1. 2017-2018 Mini Cooper 1.5, 40-60K miles. Some listings have chilli pack with a better infotainment system.

2. 2021-2023 Fiat 1.0 MHEV, 20-35K miles. I like the higher trims like Dolcevita which come with nice(er) interiors, glass roof, etc.

  
I've looked at some other small cars like C1, Aygo, Citigo and 108 but since the majority of the use case is to have non-work, social and fun drives, the design of these cars did not speak to me.

I brought a used Vauxhall grandland x on Sunday 5th October. The following Wednesday (8th) the car broke down. AA called out, found out the sumplug was missing the washer so the engine oil had pretty much drained out, it was completely empty! Dealership paid for this repair after going to a local garage. The garage also found out the clutch needs replacing. 

Since then I've been messed around so much! The heating also doesn't work (fans don't blow out) battery is on its way out (clicking sound when turning key and it doesn't always start).

I'm at a loss. Emailed Dealership twice no response, called them and they said bring the car to them for repairs. Called again to find out when to bring the car up, they said they would call me back today, and ofc they have not.

I really don't know what to do, finance company are aware but keep asking for a diagnostic for the clutch, which I have provided twice now and still no help.

Dealership also has my part ex car. My question is, what can I do? Can I take the car back and tell them I don't want it (all these issues makes me think there will be more soon) do they need to pay me the part ex value if they keep my old car?

I’ve got a 2016 Audi A3 2.0 TDI (150) 6-speed manual, around 87k miles. The car’s well looked after — serviced every 5k, timing belt done recently, DPF fully functional, no EGR/DPF deletes planned.

I’m planning a Stage 1 tune and was wondering what’s the smarter choice between RacingLine and Revo. I’ve also been recommended a local tuner who does custom maps on the dyno, and they’ve got great reviews.

My main goals are reliability and smoothness, not chasing maximum numbers. I just want to bring the car to life a bit more without stressing the clutch or turbo.

Has anyone here run RacingLine or Revo on a TDI like mine? Or gone the custom route and been happier with the results?

Last Weds I listed my car on AT at 36k.

Guy from Leeds rang and came Thursday  after a test drive and several once overs with the bonnet popped etc he suggested there was a slight leak from the front left air suspension making a hiss. I could hear the hiss too so we agreed to slightly reduce what I was hoping to get. 

Started at 30k offer and agreed at 32 as we don’t know the cost of the repair just him ringing his mate who suggested it could “cost thousands”.

Anyway we do the v5, clear finance, bank transfer (plus several grand cash from him I wasn’t expecting!). When doing the new owner, having told me he’s a builder from Leeds he asks for it to be registered into a business from Bradford - a car related business. Might be nothing?

Anyway, off he and his 3 mates go. I video them leaving to send to my dad who’s happy the car has been sold and that’s that.

Two hours later I get a brief FaceTime before it cuts off in the pitch black so I answer and can see the engine smoking and a leak underneath - call cuts after 15/20 seconds then nothing further that night.

Checked the scorpion tracker and it’s been booted at 123mph up the m62 several times and since the FaceTime only moved to the garage mentioned below.

Get a call the next day around lunch time trying to suggest an issue and potentially “not wanting the car anymore” I stop him there and reiterate it’s sold, I’ve had 0 issues in 9 months and only sold due to a new leased car and say I have 3 months warranty on it left which I can transfer and you can see what’s what and potentially claim.

Half hour passes and he rings again asking to leave warranty on my name and he will get car taken to a garage for the diagnostic and quote for repairs. This was Friday.

Since then I haven’t heard a peep apart from Saturday morning when he suggested the garage think it could be a head gasket. Again since then I’ve not heard anything. 

If I had spent 32k be chasing this up 24/7?

I know I hold no liability as I’ve been honest, in 9 months the car had absolutely zero issues and if anything I’m just trying to be helpful with the remaining warranty.

Duckdivejim (Score: 4): So here’s my 2pence and actually it’s worth less than that.

I don’t think there is a fixed limit in law but I believe the police could apply something like a ‘reasonableness test’ where the mot test is an excuse to drive a car somewhere. 

I think you could get away with using a preferred tester rather than the nearest one to your house but even going to far on that excuse you are risking an interesting conversation with a police officer. 

I’m no legal expert but I don’t think the best time to introduce novel and niche legal arguments is at the side of a road with an unimpressed copper.

I read a forum post once where a guy brought his old landrover back from France and would book an MOT in N Yorkshire to drive it home.

He never got pulled over but I can’t believe the police would be very happy with him about it.

This link seems to explain it quite well

https://www.westyorkshire.police.uk/ask-the-police/question/Q360

Note that:

If a vehicle has failed an MOT you can't drive it away from the garage if any of the defects were classed as being dangerous. Dangerous defects mean a direct and immediate risk to road safety or have a serious impact on the environment - do not drive the vehicle until they've been repaired.
You will commit an offence if you park a vehicle without an MOT on the road.
The law makes no mention as to how far you can go for an MOT but we would suggest the distance is kept as short as possible because even though you are exempt from having a valid MOT certificate in the circumstances described above, if you are stopped by the police you could still be prosecuted for any defective parts on your vehicle e.g. exhaust, brakes and tyres etc. If you call in at shops etc. on your way to the MOT, it may be held that you are using the vehicle for other purposes and the above exemption won't apply. The further you travel the more likelihood there is of your vehicle triggering an ANPR camera and you being stopped.

The garage has been recommended by a family friend, who does trust them to do a good job.

I'm kind of stuck, as I don't really have much money kicking around to spend on a new car (5000 is probably, tbh, my limit).

So, do I just bite the bullet and pay for them to fix the gearbox. Or do I cut my losses and spend that money on something else? Is there any way I can salvage any money from it, or is it just worth scrap?

The cost of the repair feels like an annoying sweetspot of uncertainty. Much higher and I'd probably just get something else,  much less and I'd just bite the bullet.

Any thoughts?

Ecoboom was coined as a result of a failing coolant hose (degas hose) which ran across the top of the turbo. Through heat cycles they degraded, leaked coolant, and before you even noticed, the engine overheated and the heads warped. 

This was fixed in 2015. 

Wet belt failures weren’t really known about at that time to the extent that they are now, and the nickname has stuck. 

Ecoboost engines fundamentally are very good engines. They have great economy and power delivery for a tiny engine. They are let down by the wet timing belt. 

If the engine oil is changed regularly with the correct WSS-M2C948-B specification oil, the belts generally tend to last until their service interval. 

The problem is that the types of car that these engines are in, and the types of people who generally buy them will tend to take them to independent garages who might not necessarily do an oil change with the right spec oil. Or, they’ll use engine flush additives during a service. These are a sure fire way of accelerating belt wear. 

When the belts degrade, they start to “moult” and shed little rubber particles. These end up clogging up the mesh on the oil pickup, leading to engine oil starvation. They also tend to block up the oil lines and filters supplying the turbo and vacuum pump. 

In 2018/2019, Ford revised the design of the engine once again and moved to a chain for the timing, but continuing to use a wet belt for the oil pump. 

As this oil pump belt is not under as much tension as the timing belt, it’s thought that this is a non-issue. Though time will tell.

Millasaurus (Score: 99): 2019 Focus has a chain driven engine. Somebody will be along shortly to point out that the oil pump is still driven by a wet belt, but this has yet to be an issue across the many manufacturers that use a similar setup. Make sure you service it properly and enjoy the car

I'm considering all options from petrol Toyota Yaris to a Nissan Leaf for the cheaper monthly costs. The Leaf has a lower purchase price than the Yaris too, even for newer vehicles.

The main issue is we don't yet have a charger installed for an EV, and we're doing a bit of work on the house which makes this unviable for about 3-6 months. Would it be ok to charge the leaf from a regular socket on the mains?  We do have an outdoor socket that could be used.

Ultimately I want an EV as our second car, but the charging situation is the blocker. An option is to go for an older affordable petrol car like a Toyota Yaris, keep it for a couple of years then trade for an EV. It seems like the older Yaris maintain value too.

1o5dyd6,Lost Service Book - Can service history be recalled online or elsewhere? I'm desperate.,"My dad bought me my 2019 Vauxhall Grandland X in 2023. It came with a service book at the time that was stamped with a full service history. I have since taken it to the place I bought it from for servicing as part of the sales deal. At some point, the service book has become separated from the rest of the manuals it was stored with in my car. No idea what happened to it. The dealership obviously denies losing it or having it, but says they can provide new stamps if I get a new book. 

This blame is on me - I honestly hadn't thought to lay eyes on it since purchase, and just assumed it was in a little black folder with the manuals that I got it with. I'm not the most car-savvy and had no idea of its importance, or I would have checked that I got it back every time and stored it somewhere safer.

My car recently broke down while driving due to a potential timing chain issue (the roadside assistance mechanic came to this conclusion based on the noise when trying to start the engine). I might be able to get the repair work done (new chain) for free at a Vauxhaull dealer, as the company that manufactures the chain - Stellantis - has recently issued a recall, and the Vauxhaull dealer who performed the recall action failed to find a fault via the app they're supposed to use to check for it (just 6 days and about 12 miles before it broke down in the middle of the road...). However, Stellantis refuses to pay for it unless I can provide a full service history.

From looking online, some manufacturers offer online service records. I signed up with Vauxhall's website and app using my VIN, and unfortunately, nothing pops up on there. Potentially, it's just that never been serviced with a Vauxhall dealer, and that's all they keep records of. Or the app is shit. I don't know.

I'm coming to you on Reddit in desperate hope that there's another way to recover my car's service history. If I have to pay for a new timing chain out of pocket - an estimated £3k repair - I'll have to sell my car to recover the money, which couldn't come at a worse time for me. I'm 26 phone calls into having this car looked at, but the service history book being missing is the one thing blocking me right now.

Some requirements: 
- Good front leg room (wife and I are both 6ft1)
- Good middle seats leg room (two bulky car seats means the front seats are often pushed forward, but we can't have that because we're tall-ish) 
- No need for leg room in the rear row of seats, just needed for the dog to lay on.
- Space in the boot for a buggy, usual baby kit, maybe a kiddies balance bike or two.
- Petrol or electric (we only do about 5k miles a year and they're often short journeys) 
- £10k max budget

The interior on the Swift Sport had more passenger leg room between my knees and gloves box than the other two despite being the smallest physically with the SX4 being next and Vitara last. The biggest and best boot was the S-Cross in terms of space so she wants one of them now.

I would say if you're thinking of a car just take the stuff you need along and see, I think some models sacrifice cabin space for boot space which is fine if you never have anything in the back.
