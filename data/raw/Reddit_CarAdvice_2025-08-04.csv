1mgxshg,What should I do?,"I’m kind of stuck between selling my Miata or keeping it. It’s a 1990 NA with 90k miles and zero rust. Honestly, I haven’t driven it much in the two years I’ve owned it because it always seems to have some issue pop up, and I just haven’t had the time to really dig into it. So it ends up sitting for months at a time. Right now, it’s down again. We just replaced the fuel pump and ignition coil. The car has good compression it cranks, but it won’t fire. I’ve been told there are only a few things that could be causing it, so I don’t think it’s a major fix. Some people have suggested turning it into a drift car since the chassis is clean, but that doesn’t feel like the right move for me at the moment. I’ve had people tell me I’ll regret selling it, and I’m trying not to give up on it, but at this point, it just feels like a paperweight. I want to bring it back to life, but it’s hard to stay motivated when it’s been sitting for so long. The car has had some moisture problems so I’m wondering it has something to do with that.

After letting it sit and trying the car again it would take a second to start up but eventually turn over. I was able to get home and the next morning the car was completely fine again to get to work but when I went home I tried to park my car and again went up a ramp at a slow pace and it stalled. I had to wait again to turn it on and park. Yesterday I was able to get to work and back with no problems but today I noticed the clicking noise was a little louder. I also got my battery checked and alternator and they are both in perfect condition. I also got a fix checked from AutoZone which I’ll attach to here.

1mgx7gu,DO NOT trust Safelite Auto with your vehicle.,"Here's my nightmare story with Safelite. 

Technician came out for service on July 12th 2025. He wasn't super friendly or professional, multiple times it seemed like he was talking on the phone during the install via his airpods. As he walked up he nodded at me and then told me it would take 45 minutes to an hour.  
  
He then got to work without speaking any further. The tech during his windshield install cracked the drivers side trim and then went to the passenger side and completely broke the trim in half. When he finished the install, the tech went and took a photo of the drivers side trim piece as well as the passenger side trim piece. At the end of the install, very nonchalantly told me he damaged the trim pieces, he took me over specifically to the one that was broken in half and said to me ""When I was taking this off it did break, so we went ahead and ordered both panels"".

I then expected to hear from a representative either later that day or on Monday since it was a weekend. After the weekend and not having any further communication on July 14th I called the customer service to try to figure out the status. The gal on the phone was helpful and friendly. She ended up telling me that a service center was working on ordering both trim pieces and taking care of it.

On July 17th the local office called me and apologized for the inconvenience and told me they were working on getting those moldings in. He also informed me he was having a harder time finding them, I told him I would send him the links where I found them in stock, so I did. I even sent him the custom plastidip paint that I painted the car with. This plastidip also requires a special rig to paint with. He didn't respond to any of those messages.

The next day I followed up to that same number I sent the images and links to, no response. I heard nothing back until July 22nd when someone from that local office called me and left a voicemail saying he was waiting on ""those moldings"" (plural) to arrive. Then on July 25th I got a call from the local office telling me the molding(s) had arrived and to schedule a pick up.

I went down there on July 28th and they only had the passenger side molding for me. The man at the counter apologized and said they would get the driver side ordered asap. Then a few hours later I get a call and the assistant manager said that they weren't going to replace the drivers side because it was only a scratch. Furthermore they said that the tech should have told me since the vehicle age (2006), if he breaks something I am out of luck.

I would never have agreed to that, nor was I ever told such a thing, I have video proof.

The panel is not scratched, it is very clearly cracked. The representative on the phone was zero help, and told me they wouldn't be covering the damage they caused to my vehicle.

This is absolutely unacceptable.

on July 29th I called the main customer service number after that call and I got a hold of a gentleman where I explained thew entire dilemma. He said that he would send an email to the district managers, store managers, etc. I asked if I could forward this exact message above to him with videos and photos, he said yes and that I would probably receive a call that day or the next. 

Shocker, I did not receive a call. It is now August 3rd with no communication from their team. 

My car is a 2006, yes it is ""older"" it's also extremely well cared for and restored. It's not just some throw away car that they can break parts on and tell me to go pound sand. 

Do yourself a favor if you have a choice, stay as far away from these dirt bags as you can.

1mgtbte,Squeaking noise when driving over bumps,"I drive a 2017 Hyundai Sonata, base model, 2.4L 4 cylinder engine. 80,700 miles

This weekend I've been hearing a squeaking noise from the front drivers side while going over bumps and sometimes after turning.  It reminds me of when I had suspension work just last year. Last summer, I got a new control arm, struts, and sway bar links. A few days after I had the work done, knocking and squeaking noises came back,  and I had to get the sway bar links tightened. The noise went away after that, until this weekend anyway. 

I'm calling a mechanic tomorrow to find out what this squeaking could be caused by. I'll be really discouraged if it's the suspension again. Could I really need more suspension work after only 15,000 miles? I don't drive on unpaved roads. The car drives fine otherwise. And I don't hear the noise after every bump.

Do you think something could just need to be tightened, or could it be something else other than the suspension? I got new brakes and new tires in May.

1mgmn4u,Advice on Cam Carrier Reseal Repair,"2014 Subaru Impreza, 110,000 miles

Dealer advises that I do a cam carrier reseal, although they provided little detail on how bad it is.  Quoted $4000 for repair mostly labor, as I understand they have to take a lot of stuff out.

I have a slow oil leak, I am putting in about a quart of oil, or sometimes a bit more, between oil changes.  I do an oil change every 6 months and am generally under or right around 5000 miles when I go in.

I'm going to get an independent shop to look at it and quote.

I have a few questions, as someone who is very low knowledge when it comes to car repairs:

1.  Is this quote reasonable?  I'm guessing an independent shop can do it cheaper, but have no idea of what range is normal for this.

2.  What questions should I be asking the mechanic who looks at it?    
  
3.  Is this something that you can wait and see if it gets worse, or am I risking major damage?  I don't really want to do the repair right now, would like to wait at least six months due to other more pressing issues.

  
Thanks for your help!

1mg9l5d,AGM vs FLA batteries,"2020 Nissan Sentra 2020 I am considering this: 
https://a.co/d/9BC0mbn

The first battery lasted about 2.5 years. 
The second battery lasted about 2.5 years.

I'm trying to figure out why.  Is it just normal or is it my usage patterns. 
I don't intentionally drain the battery but it happens from time to time.

I think ultimately if I keep working in the field and I'm always using my car as a mobile office, I will end up getting a second battery in my trunk.  

I think for now replacing the FLA with a AGM and specifically the yellow top one that I linked earlier would probably be my best option.   I try not to discharge the battery too much but sometimes things happen and I can't always control how long I'm sitting in my car, and don't always want to have the engine idling.

So I've been doing some research and I'm trying to verify this with anybody who understands electrical systems in cars. 

I'm viewing this problem with the skill set of a computer technician, and I really don't know much about car electronics except what is transferable into my expertise.

My understanding:

FLA - Flooded Lead-Acid  has been the standard car battery chemistry for many years and it's design is to function as a starting battery and cycling this battery and discharging it often can wear it out quicker.

AGM - Absorbed Glass Mat
It's more forgiving if you routinely discharge your battery either by accident or usage patterns. 

I don't have an upgraded audio system but I think my power use profile might be similar.  There are times when I will sit in the car with the radio on and the engine off for up to 30 minutes.

 I do have a pretty nice electronics charger in my car and I try not to plug too much stuff into it if the engine is not running but theoretically if I had a laptop and a phone and a tablet plugged into it it could be pulling 13.96 amps across the three devices. (Charger is rated at 167.5 w distributed across the three ports) The 12 volt socket on the car is rated at 15 amps, but I don't think car manufacturers anticipate that people will be routinely using this port close to capacity.

To complicate things a sensor in the door is  malfunctioning so I'm having to contend with making sure the lights in the car are off in addition to, the demands of summer air conditioning in the car and my normal high usage of power.  I'm wondering how fast the alternator in the car can replenish the battery and under normal conditions.  There's been a few times where I've totally drained the battery due to my light issue, and I think this is contributed to my most recent failure.  I think this summer has been the perfect storm, high on the battery while I'm driving, due to car electronics, charging devices, and air conditioning and then the alternator having to try to catch up after being totally drained from the lights.

From what I'm reading people with large power draws, are those who cycle the battery more often, should have a AGM batteries.

If someone reads this and has the expertise to explain and confirm or assess my thoughts to me that would be wonderful.",0,1754193099.0,3,autorepair,1754329758,2025-08-03 03:51:39,2025-08-04 17:49:18,"djltoronto (Score: 1): AGM is supposed to be more robust with respect to high depth of discharge.

In order to make it last longer, you need to reduce the frequency of occurrences of high depth of discharge events.  AGM should be more robust, but I wouldn't expect seven or eight years in your usage case, unless you change your habits. 

The current AGM battery in my Kia hatchback, is 7.5 years old and counting...

WesTxStoner425 (Score: 1): An idling Sentra doesn't use much gas; the hassle of a constantly discharging battery wouldn't be worth turning the car off imo. Chase down that light issue,  and maybe you could get away with a standard battery.

Short-Read4830 (Score: 12): Dry rotted duct sealant, hopefully it's just trim around the end of the little duct leading to the vent and not the blend door.

RandomGuyDroppingIn (Score: 6): Its the seal along the ducting where it meets the blend door. Its probably a large square shaped piece. With temperature flux it can harden and break apart, then get blown through the vents.

Its not going to hurt anything, but it will cause your air conditioning and heat to “leak” in behind the dash area and it may feel like your air conditioning and heat doesn’t work as well. Ideally you need to pull the center console and potentially the dash, and look into replacing the foam. You can straight up just use 1/2” square stick on foam strips from Home Depot used for doors and windows."

And here is the software library that I used for this that I found on the Arduino IDE: [https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-CAN](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-CAN)

I edited the [mcp.h](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-CAN/blob/master/src/MCP2515.h) file to match the frequency of the MCP2515. I was trying to use the [CAN Receiver](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-CAN/blob/master/examples/CANReceiver/CANReceiver.ino) program that this library has while the car was on, however it is not working and is only outputting the initial string for when it powers on. My current hypothesis is that the gateway module is preventing the CAN messages from being viewed from the OBDII port. Will I have to look for another way to view F-CAN data?

OBD2 protocol only answers to questions, so unless youre asking you will find nothing, and few cars (ex. pre \~2021 peugeots) will have the ""default"" pins (6,14) hooked up to a canbus that has more ECUs than ""just"" the gateway (its intended for OBD2, UDS, ... only)
