The car is a 2014 VW Golf. (I've followed the cara recommended services and all that)

This problem started a couple of days ago after the car been parked for a couple of days. All of a sudden it makes a noise that I haven't heard before and I've been driving this car for 8 years so I know what it usually sounds like.

3 days ago I dropped it off at the car mechanics and told them about the issue. They tried to find the cause but couldn't find anything. Their first thought was the wheel house but it looked good. They didn't even charge me anything since they couldn't identify the problem. 

You can hear the sound/noise in the video, although faint. It's really noticeable when driving and especially at higher speed.

If I should try to explain the noise It's sounds like when you driving fast on a lower gear, but it doesn't go away when changing to a higher gear. And it gets more intense the faster you drive.

There a no shakings in the steeringwheel and the car don't sway in any direction. The only thing I've noticed since before the noise is that the AC doesn't work as well but that might be unrelated, it's been really warm here lately so it might be exhausted somehow. 

My last hope is that someone here experienced the same problem or in any way can help me find the cause. The mechanics can help me but only if I can help them find what's causing this.

So my question is, Are they not able to use a tool to clear the check engine light/codes and force the sensors to relearn? or do I just have to keep driving like they said and hope it eventually happens. And will the sensor relearn even make a difference in how it's driving?

A possibility is very fine cracks that can allow coolant intrusion, I've had them be nearly impossible to see until the machine shop does a dye penetration test. Since you've already done the work of removing the heads already (i'm assuming both), I'd still take them to a machine shop to have them looked at, checked for warping and cracks.  

Also, it's pretty rare for BOTH heads to suddenly fail unless there was extreme overheating going on. Consider the possibility of the lower intake manifold gasket failing, allowing coolant to leak into cylinders. Since you already have the intake off, look carefully at the gasket material around the coolant passages. Sometimes it's really obvious that it's failed, or can't account for extreme pitting where it mates to the head.

1mgtc6r,AC low side too high,"My 2013 Kia Rio's AC began not cooling a few days ago. Last night I connected a manifold gauge after my wife got home (1 hour commute) and with the compressor running I had the low side at 115 psi and the high at 165 psi. Garage temperature was maybe 85 to 90ish degrees.

The attached video shows the compressor while I turn the AC on and then off. I did also check that the compressor connector was receiving 12v.

I didn't have time to do any more that night. High pressure hose came out but when I disconnected the low pressure hose, all the refrigerant came out. It was my fault because I turned the adapter the wrong way attempting to close it and the valve got stuck open.

I know the schrader valve will need to be replaced first. But what could cause the low side to be so high? The only other thing I noticed was that when I shut the car off, the low/high pressure difference was about 15 psi.

The expansion valve seems easy enough to replace but what else can I do or check now that the lines emptied?

1mgpb9y,Frugal restoration options,"I've got an 02 CRV with 275k miles. Bought it at about 215k and poor maintenance had already done its work on the engine/transmission, we've been taking care of it since then but it's approaching time to consider my options. Really struggling with the decision making and I don't really have anyone to discuss it with. This is long but I tried to cut it down to necessary info. 

I'm very mechanically capable and I can do any of this myself. After breaking it down, even the most expensive options would be cheaper than going into debt for a new or new-to-me car in the long run. Upfront investment is higher but from a yearly perspective it's cheaper. If you think I'm insane that's fine lol. I get the ""cut your losses"" argument but my goal is to stay out of debt and fix what I have. We haven't put a ton of money into this car and most of the current issues are just age related. If you think that's actually the best decision I'm willing to hear out your reasoning but otherwise I'm pretty set on restoring this one. Essentially top end cost will be maybe $15k if I get everything absolutely new/reman, some shop labor, basically treat it like an actual restoration. Probably around half that or less, if I do most of it myself/used parts or rebuild. After that it's upkeep. 

So just looking for y'alls opinion on what juice may offer the most squeeze, i.e. what options may offer the most longevity for the money. If a 5k reman engine will get me 200k miles and a used one will get me 150k then I'd be more inclined to put in a used one, y'know. Just need some thoughts and advice. 

I need a lot of various things in the coming months like rear suspension, axles, calipers, cat, fuel pump, etc just stuff that's been on the car since factory and needs replaced. Couple known issues like a brake booster vacuum leak. I have most of the parts for all this so it's not really important. 

Transmission / torque converter will need replaced or rebuilt soon. This is the big one. The cat converter could be simulating some issues, but it's just old and in rough shape, even after good fluid attention etc it's gonna need replaced soon. Judder, little rattling and jerking in lower gears is starting to happen, it's not having a good time. But I'm gonna run it till she don't move. 

So my options are:
- Source the necessary parts, preferably OEM, and rebuild it myself. This is extremely daunting and would take a while but I'm confident I could manage it. But not to the grade that a shop could do it, and I would be concerned about messing up something small that I don't notice for a while. Probably wouldn't last as long as I'd like either. I don't have the tools to properly refresh it. 
- Get a shop to rebuild it. More money, more peace of mind. Probably second cheapest. Shop warranty is a plus. 
- Junkyard / used transmission, install myself. I can get one for about 1k from eBay or the salvage yard. But I'm rolling the dice on whether it will last long enough for the juice to be worth the squeeze. eBay warranty won't cover me if I install it myself. 
- Get a shop to source and install a used transmission or give them one to install
- Rebuild a used transmission. Probably not as intense, just check the clutch packs and make sure they're good, filter/seals, check balls etc. A little more money but it'd be more peace of mind. I could also see if a shop is willing to do this. 
- Remanufactured. Most expensive option, it'll run me about 3k. I would have the benefit of basically a fresh transmission and I could begin maintenance from 0 and keep it running essentially forever. If I want warranty I can get a shop to do it but it's more money. 

I'm leaning towards a used transmission and a remanufactured torque converter + transfer case. But I'm not sure if that + shop labor is a better option than installing a remanufactured one myself. I can install the used one but due to where eBay is at these days, warranty is kind of essential. I'd probably only self-install from a reputable seller. 


Engine - 

Not really in too rough a shape. It's the things like the IACV, vacuum leak and cat that are causing issues. Most of the accessories and cooling etc is working or new/aftermarket. It got a new head gasket 20-30k ago and it runs like a champ, idle is just weird and very picky. Not horrible. But it's old, and if I'm going to pull out the trans I may as well pull the engine. 

I may also just leave the engine and hold on to whichever one I get. I'd have to pull everything out again but if I get more miles out of this engine it may be worth it. I think it'll run for a while if I take care of idle/fuel/exhaust issues. At the very least I need to get the head checked for flatness and potentially resurfaced, I believe it is slightly warped. 

Realistically I should take care of the vacuum leak and other minor issues, replace the fuel pump etc, and see where it's at. 

But when I consider replacement, my options are basically the same as the transmission. Rebuild myself, used, rebuild a used one, remanufactured, and for all options either do it myself or go to a shop. 

I'm leaning towards rebuilding the bottom end (bearings, rings, seals, etc) and getting a remanufactured head. The internals aren't too expensive and a remanufactured head is about $800. Given the importance of VTEC and how picky these are I think it'd be worth it. I could rebuild the head myself as well but it'd be a step down in quality IMO.    

TL;DR It's got 275k miles, and I can probably get another 200k at least if I replace the engine/trans and maintain it perfectly, so should I go used/rebuilt/reman, and which options are worth letting a shop do it? Which combo of these options will net me the most miles per dollar?

1mggpqe,Engine Braking Mega-Thread,"Hi there, I'm posting this to see if we can come to a unified conclusion regarding the use of engine braking.

So here are the benefits and drawbacks I can think of right now:

Benefits:
-No brake pads wear
-No brake fade in downhills
-Responsiveness (RPM range)

Drawbacks:
-Higher RPM's = More wear ( and potentialy destructive if oil is not in operating temp. )
-Syncros increased wear if you don't properly rev match

So...

-Is it worth it if you don't rev match? 

In other words, do the wear of the syncros and of the overall increased engine wear makes engine braking worth it?

-How close to the redline are you once you stop engine braking and start using normal braking? Sometimes I think ""...I'm at 40km/h at 6000RPM, maybe it would be healthier for the car to stay at let's say 3000RPM and apply the good ol' brake pedal""

-I find it much more useful at high or medium speeds; at low speeds and rpm, it's harder to match the revs, and I think it just doesn't make much sense.

-The energy that the engine ""transforms"" through the effects of compression goes from kinetic energy to heat and noise, right? Could that combined energy (heat and noise) cause problems or overheating?

Let me know if I'm missing something.

Unless you live on top of a mountain this should not be a problem because the oil - and the metal that it lubricates & separates - should be at operating temperature and the clearances should be at spec, especially if you have just climbed the hill you are about to descend.




>Syncros increased wear if you don't properly rev match


I doubt that most people are rev-matching during normal driving. But if you're worried about wear to the synchros when engine braking then just rev-match when you downshift.




>How close to the redline are you once you stop engine braking and start using normal braking?


If you're getting too close to the redline the tap the service brakes to slow the vehicle down and bring RPMs down away from the redline. Engine braking is more effective at higher RPMs than at lower RPMs, so when the RPMs get low enough that engine braking isn't effective anymore you can always downshift and use engine braking in the next lowest gear.

I bought my 95 Miata about 5 years ago. Absolutely love it. I lived in a different state for two years and left my it at my parents, came back, drove it once and the clutch died (it was dying when I bought it, and I taught myself and my brother how to drive stick in it so it wasn‚Äôt a surprise). I have a friend who will help me fix it I just gotta buy the parts and wait for winter when the weather is nicer. It‚Äôs been sitting for a year since the clutch died. Since it‚Äôs been a while since I drove it regularly I‚Äôm debating on fixing it and selling it before I drive it again and fall in love with it all over again. I bought it when I wanted to be a car girl and learn how to work on cars. I still value learning how to work on it, but honestly I mostly keep it just cuz I genuinely enjoy driving it.

I‚Äôve had so many people offer to buy it completely unprompted. Husband says if I do sell it I shouldn‚Äôt do it for the money, I should do it only if I don‚Äôt enjoy it anymore. He also really supports me keeping it forever, which has always been my plan until recently. He‚Äôs not a car guy, so I know he‚Äôs not biased. As of right now I‚Äôd be doing it for the money, since it‚Äôs got over 100k and I‚Äôm worried about cost of maintaining it over the next several years. It needs a new soft top, the aftermarket radio only partially works, and the previous owner replaced the original wheels with rims that I really don‚Äôt care for. I‚Äôve always wanted to put original wheels back on it, but can‚Äôt really justify paying for something that the car technically came with originally, ya know? Other than that it‚Äôs completely stock. I do really love the car, and I bought it for dirt cheap thru the dealership I worked at before prices went wild, so you can‚Äôt really beat that nowadays either. Even writing this post I think I‚Äôm leaning toward keeping it, I just struggle with justifying the financial aspect. Am I being too cheap? At what point do I accept that sometimes happiness costs money and it‚Äôs worth it? My old daily I dumped around $10k into over the years to avoid buying a new car, and in hindsight I‚Äôm realizing I should have sold it way sooner, so I think that‚Äôs partially why I‚Äôm afraid to do the same thing with my Miata. But unlike the daily, I think the Miata would be worth it because of how fun it is (and its clean title, whereas my daily was not). Not to mention, it‚Äôs just my seasonal ride so I won‚Äôt be putting on as many miles.

I only moved it a couple feet forward, I didn't do any more than that for fear of breaking something. The noise and feel seemed to be coming from the back of the car. There was also a decent amount of resistance preventing it from going forward. In reverse, the car was fine, absolutely no problem.

1mgx7gu,DO NOT trust Safelite Auto with your vehicle.,"Here's my nightmare story with Safelite. 

Technician came out for service on July 12th 2025. He wasn't super friendly or professional, multiple times it seemed like he was talking on the phone during the install via his airpods. As he walked up he nodded at me and then told me it would take 45 minutes to an hour.  
  
He then got to work without speaking any further.¬†The tech during his windshield install cracked the drivers side trim and then went to the passenger side and completely broke the trim in half. When he finished the install, the tech went and took a photo of the drivers side trim piece as well as the passenger side trim piece.¬†At the end of the install, very nonchalantly¬†told me he damaged the trim pieces, he took me over specifically to the one that was broken in half and said to me ""When I was taking this off it did break, so we went ahead and ordered both panels"".

I then expected to hear from a representative either later that day or on Monday since it was a weekend.¬†After the weekend and not having any further communication on July 14th I called the customer service to try to figure out the status. The gal on the phone was helpful and friendly. She ended up telling me that a service center was working on ordering both trim pieces and taking care of it.

On July¬†17th the local office called me and apologized for the inconvenience and told me they were working on getting those moldings in. He also informed me he was having a harder time finding them, I told him I would send him the links where I found them in stock, so I did. I even sent him the custom plastidip paint that I painted the car with. This plastidip also requires a special rig to paint with. He didn't respond to any of those messages.

The next day I followed up to that same number I sent the images and links to, no response.¬†I heard nothing back until July 22nd when someone from that local office called me and left a voicemail saying he was waiting¬†on ""those moldings"" (plural) to arrive.¬†Then on July 25th I got a call from the local office telling me the molding(s) had arrived and to schedule a pick up.

I went down there on July 28th and they only had the passenger side molding for me. The man at the counter apologized and said they would get the driver side ordered asap.¬†Then a few hours later I get a call and the assistant manager said that they weren't going to replace the drivers side because it was only a scratch. Furthermore they said that the tech should have told me since the vehicle age (2006), if he breaks something¬†I am out of luck.

I would never have agreed to that, nor was I ever told such a thing, I have video proof.

The panel is not scratched, it is very clearly cracked. The representative on the phone was zero help, and told me they wouldn't be covering the damage they caused to my vehicle.

This is absolutely unacceptable.

on July 29th I called the main customer service number after that call and I got a hold of a gentleman where I explained thew entire dilemma. He said that he would send an email to the district managers, store managers, etc. I asked if I could forward this exact message above to him with videos and photos, he said yes and that I would probably receive a call that day or the next. 

Shocker, I did not receive a call. It is now August 3rd with no communication from their team. 

My car is a 2006, yes it is ""older"" it's also extremely well cared for and restored. It's not just some throw away car that they can break parts on and tell me to go pound sand. 

Do yourself a favor if you have a choice, stay as far away from these dirt bags as you can.

1mgtbte,Squeaking noise when driving over bumps,"I drive a 2017 Hyundai Sonata, base model, 2.4L 4 cylinder engine. 80,700 miles

This weekend I've been hearing a squeaking noise from the front drivers side while going over bumps and sometimes after turning.  It reminds me of when I had suspension work just last year. Last summer, I got a new control arm, struts, and sway bar links. A few days after I had the work done, knocking and squeaking noises came back,  and I had to get the sway bar links tightened. The noise went away after that, until this weekend anyway. 

I'm calling a mechanic tomorrow to find out what this squeaking could be caused by. I'll be really discouraged if it's the suspension again. Could I really need more suspension work after only 15,000 miles? I don't drive on unpaved roads. The car drives fine otherwise. And I don't hear the noise after every bump.

Do you think something could just need to be tightened, or could it be something else other than the suspension? I got new brakes and new tires in May.

1mgmn4u,Advice on Cam Carrier Reseal Repair,"2014 Subaru Impreza, 110,000 miles

Dealer advises that I do a cam carrier reseal, although they provided little detail on how bad it is.  Quoted $4000 for repair mostly labor, as I understand they have to take a lot of stuff out.

I have a slow oil leak, I am putting in about a quart of oil, or sometimes a bit more, between oil changes.  I do an oil change every 6 months and am generally under or right around 5000 miles when I go in.

I'm going to get an independent shop to look at it and quote.

I have a few questions, as someone who is very low knowledge when it comes to car repairs:

1.  Is this quote reasonable?  I'm guessing an independent shop can do it cheaper, but have no idea of what range is normal for this.

2.  What questions should I be asking the mechanic who looks at it?    
  
3.  Is this something that you can wait and see if it gets worse, or am I risking major damage?  I don't really want to do the repair right now, would like to wait at least six months due to other more pressing issues.

  
Thanks for your help!

1mg9l5d,AGM vs FLA batteries,"2020 Nissan Sentra 2020 I am considering this: 
https://a.co/d/9BC0mbn

The first battery lasted about 2.5 years. 
The second battery lasted about 2.5 years.

I'm trying to figure out why.  Is it just normal or is it my usage patterns. 
I don't intentionally drain the battery but it happens from time to time.

I think ultimately if I keep working in the field and I'm always using my car as a mobile office, I will end up getting a second battery in my trunk.  

I think for now replacing the FLA with a AGM and specifically the yellow top one that I linked earlier would probably be my best option.   I try not to discharge the battery too much but sometimes things happen and I can't always control how long I'm sitting in my car, and don't always want to have the engine idling.

So I've been doing some research and I'm trying to verify this with anybody who understands electrical systems in cars. 

I'm viewing this problem with the skill set of a computer technician, and I really don't know much about car electronics except what is transferable into my expertise.

My understanding:

FLA - Flooded Lead-Acid  has been the standard car battery chemistry for many years and it's design is to function as a starting battery and cycling this battery and discharging it often can wear it out quicker.

AGM - Absorbed Glass Mat
It's more forgiving if you routinely discharge your battery either by accident or usage patterns. 

I don't have an upgraded audio system but I think my power use profile might be similar.  There are times when I will sit in the car with the radio on and the engine off for up to 30 minutes.

 I do have a pretty nice electronics charger in my car and I try not to plug too much stuff into it if the engine is not running but theoretically if I had a laptop and a phone and a tablet plugged into it it could be pulling 13.96 amps across the three devices. (Charger is rated at 167.5 w distributed across the three ports) The 12 volt socket on the car is rated at 15 amps, but I don't think car manufacturers anticipate that people will be routinely using this port close to capacity.

To complicate things a sensor in the door is  malfunctioning so I'm having to contend with making sure the lights in the car are off in addition to, the demands of summer air conditioning in the car and my normal high usage of power.  I'm wondering how fast the alternator in the car can replenish the battery and under normal conditions.  There's been a few times where I've totally drained the battery due to my light issue, and I think this is contributed to my most recent failure.  I think this summer has been the perfect storm, high on the battery while I'm driving, due to car electronics, charging devices, and air conditioning and then the alternator having to try to catch up after being totally drained from the lights.

From what I'm reading people with large power draws, are those who cycle the battery more often, should have a AGM batteries.

If someone reads this and has the expertise to explain and confirm or assess my thoughts to me that would be wonderful.",0,1754193099.0,3,autorepair,1754336275,2025-08-03 03:51:39,2025-08-04 19:37:55,"djltoronto (Score: 1): AGM is supposed to be more robust with respect to high depth of discharge.

In order to make it last longer, you need to reduce the frequency of occurrences of high depth of discharge events.  AGM should be more robust, but I wouldn't expect seven or eight years in your usage case, unless you change your habits. 

The current AGM battery in my Kia hatchback, is 7.5 years old and counting...

I recently bought a 2013 Mazda3 Sport 6-speed 2.0L Sedan with 72k. I saw the car needed brakes and rotors, so I factored that into the purchase.

All in all, I paid $10k for that car before this story. 

Fast forward a bit, and I go to Valvoline to get an oil change. At their location, I am told to replace my power steering and both air filters. Ok, fine. That and the oil change, which went fine- a detail for later.

Fast forward to a few days ago, I'm going to do another oil change. I go to another Valvoline and they do the same process. Except this time their tube hit the oil pan and broke a hole in it. They took some pictures and saw that it was quite rusted, but the car worked fine and didn't have any issues before it came in. This went from about $65 for the change to now $1,674 for the oil pan.

The truck has about 75,000 miles on it, and I changed the oil about two weeks ago. Recently, my dad bought two 20oz bottles of Royal Purple Max Clean Synthetic Fuel System Cleaner. Since the truck has a 36-gallon fuel tank, and the instructions said to use 1oz per gallon, I thought it would be fine to use both bottles‚Äîeven though that‚Äôs a little more than the recommended amount.

When my dad filled up the truck, the gauge was nearly empty, but he only filled the tank to about 3/4 full after adding the cleaner. He drove the truck for a day or two, then started noticing a slight loss of acceleration and some slipping while driving. Soon after, the check engine light came on.

Once I realized the tank hadn‚Äôt been completely filled, I went to top it off. At that point, the tank was about half full. When I unscrewed the gas cap, I heard a sizzling noise‚Äîlike pressure releasing. While pumping gas, the tank would seem to fill up extremely quickly, causing the pump to shut off every few seconds. It kept doing this, making it difficult to add more fuel because the gas wasn‚Äôt going down into the tank as fast as usual.

I took the truck to a mechanic because of these fueling issues and the slipping I‚Äôd noticed. He ran a diagnostic scan, which pulled up code P0741. He mentioned there were three codes in total, but I only remember that one related to the torque converter. He advised me to keep driving the truck to burn off more fuel so he could check the gas tank and investigate further.

Here are my questions:

* Should I change the transmission fluid? Would that help?
* Did the fuel cleaner cause these problems, or is it just a coincidence and the truck had these issue already?
* What should i do?",0,1754197944.0,6,mechanic,1754336275,2025-08-03 05:12:24,2025-08-04 19:37:55,"Dangerous_Echidna229 (Score: 3): Use TOP TIER GAS and you won‚Äôt need to worry about additives.

Secondly, if you're doing that, I would recommend a floor jack. Bottle jacks have very small pads, so smaller surface area. Jack up the front or back first, not the sides, place your jack stands on solid frame or on jack points if you have the space. Make sure all jack stands are firmly in place, all feet on the ground, all pads/claws on the car firmly and flatly, none hanging off or partially on, and you're golden. Make sure you do this on completely level ground, and I personally like to use the jack itself to keep tension on the car as extra help if something does happen and it falls, that the jack may prevent it OR the jack is already under the car so that anyone assisting me can quickly get it back up, as a safety thing.

1mg6mhg,"Are these +30% spikes in fuel trim normal? (2017 Chevy Equinox, 2.4L)","I'm chasing code P2097, Alldata defines the code as ""Post Catalyst Fuel Trim System High Limit, the fuel trim bias is greater than a calibrated amount."" My understanding is that this means the car is running lean, and is having to trim too much in order to compensate. The only time I'm seeing fuel trims past +/-10% is immediately after the engine enters closed loop operation, where short term trim (green waveform in top graph) spikes up to +30%, long term up to 5.5% (blue waveform in middle graph.) Is this normal, or are these spikes what's causing the fault? Loop status is in the bottom graph, these periods of open loop happened when braking at highway speeds.

I work on diesels for living, not gas, so this O2 sensor stoichiometry voodoo bullshit is new to me.

Some background on the vehicle, it's a 2017 ~~shit heap~~ Chevy Equinox that belongs to my parents. It previously went to a local mechanic, and had a NAPA reman engine installed, due to excess oil consumption and VVT issues. They also replaced the cat and both O2 sensors, they appear to be Denso sensors. Car was fine for a bit, then started having multiple intermittent fuel trim codes. Went back to the same mechanic multiple times, he came up with the idea that my brother had been putting E85 in it, and that an alcohol content sensor in the sending unit was bad, so he drained the tank and replaced sending unit. Problem came back again, so my parents asked me to take a look instead of wasting time and money going back to the same mechanic. Found many problems with his work, the main one being that the high pressure fuel pump was left very loose. Since the pump is basically just a plunger that rides against the camshaft, being loose caused it to only pump maybe half it's volume with every revolution. I (properly) installed a new pump, and we didn't have any codes for a while. Then P2097 appeared, at first it was intermittent, but I can pretty reliably get the code to come back every time I drive the car at highway speeds now. So far I have not found any exhaust, intake, or vacuum leaks.",2,1754183820.0,3,mechanic,1754336275,2025-08-03 01:17:00,2025-08-04 19:37:55,"Big-pp-the-3rd (Score: 1): If you‚Äôre not already, use the obd2 generic live data and see if it does the same.

The generic obd2 side will be more accurate for that stuff in my experience.

q1field (Score: 1): Post-catalyst fuel trim uses the downstream O2 sensor as a bias (like a ""checksum"") to measure the functionality of the upstream air-fuel sensor (which is a different term for wide-band oxygen sensor). If it's reporting a bias limit reached, look for exhaust leaks first. It could suggest a problem with the upstream sensor, but not likely if both sensors were replaced. 

What brand of high pressure fuel pump did you install? I've encountered reliability issues with aftermarket ones. Is the lifter OK after the old one was side loading it being loose and all?

What else... cam timing is critical to the function of the fuel pressure control solenoid, but if that was an issue, there would be cam-crank correlation codes.

Sticky evap purge solenoid can cause fuel trim issues, but would present its own set of codes and extended crank, especially after a fill-up.

Dirty or aftermarket MAF sensors or turbulence in the air intake for whatever reason can throw fuel trim off. 

Hopefully the geniuses that replaced the engine cleaned out the PCV orifice in the intake manifold. That could cause issues, the worst of which is a blown out rear main seal."

If I wait 10+ minutes and try again, half of the time it's better.

It's passed multiple battery and alternator tests. My mechanic also checked these over  Friday and suggested it's either a worn timing chain (240k miles) or a slipped gear on the camshaft, but they don't do jobs that big. Also, it has new coil packs and spark plugs.

Yesterday, as I was driving home, after a bad shift into first, the car didn't want to stay in any gear. As I pulled over, different dashboard lights came on, and the car shut off, and then it wouldn't start. Jumping didn't help either. Not until over an hour later, waiting 20 minutes in between start attempts (not using jumpers the last few attempts), did it finally start and barely get me home.

  
My question is, is my mechanic right? Does a worn timing chain or a slipped gear on the camshaft explain everything, even the electrical symptoms? Or could there be multiple problems? One of them being a worn clutch? There's some corrosion on the battery terminals that I might try and clean today, could that be causing some of this?

1. **Hot soak** (30C/86F): after the car bakes in the sun all day, the first 4‚Äì5 min of driving show 2.5‚Äì3 k RPM flare at 30‚Äì40 mph, then it drives normally.
2. **Long summer trips:** six-hour interstate runs are fine until I crawl in traffic afterward, when slip reappears‚Äîsuggesting overheated, thinned fluid.
3. **Cold mornings** (<10C / 50F): similar brief slip at start-up, gone once the CVT reaches operating temperature.

Questions:

* Are these classic signs of impending CVT failure?
* Could the Castrol fluid‚Äîeven though it claims NS-2/NS-3 compatibility‚Äîbe causing the issue?
* Would adding an auxiliary cooler help, or is that irrelevant given the cold-weather slip?

Any help from people who have dealt with slipping CVTs is appreciated.",3,1754222138.0,7,AskMechanics,1754336275,2025-08-03 11:55:38,2025-08-04 19:37:55,"Fieroboom (Score: 1): Did you replace the small cartridge filter as well?

If so, I'll insert the obligatory safety warning that you definitely need some type of roll cage before attempting that, because it sounds like you're in a big rush, and that's a recipe for disaster...


As for the car, I would start by connecting a scanner to see if it gives you any clues about why it won't start. I would also temporarily plug the airbags back in to be sure it still starts normally, and it's not because of something else that is coincidentally wrong.


If it does start properly with the airbags, then I would start researching airbag delete information."
1mgfxyi,Does soldered wire repair affect sensor readings?,"Hi all, I have a MK7 Golf GTI, and upgrading my intercooler accidentally ripped a wire out of the coolant temp sensor harness plug. I ended up cutting into it and soldering in a replacement until I get a nice new one with piggyback wires (which ill need to solder anyway).

I was wondering on VW or generally, does the coolant temperature sensor rely on resistance/impedance causing voltage drop, where the wire gauge would matter, or is this not a concern?

I did the repair with solder and a similar looking overall gauge copper wire but the oem wire seemed to have fewer strands that were individually thicker.

1mgehyi,Car ac randomly went off,"Hello! i‚Äôm reaching out in hopes to maybe get a general understanding of what might be going on with my car? i understand i might not get a exact pin on what my cars issue is, but i figured i might ask anybody here and hopefully get their opinions!

About a month ago, i bought a 2013 Honda Civic Hybrid off of facebook, everything was fine with it, but the only thing that seemed a bit off was the ac, anytime id be in the low settings  id hear a sound coming from under the passenger dashboard, very low. i figured that was a normal thing for a 12 year old car.

especially since if i just turned up the ac all the way it would just drown out the sound.

today while driving it, i had the ac on medium speed, lowest temp and out of nowhere in what felt like a instant, the ac went down to the temperature from outside, not hotter not colder. the hot still works perfectly but my cold is completely out.  i also realized that the air recirculation just completely turned off? i tried to turn it back on when my ac dropped temp but the light wouldn‚Äôt go back on. not even know.

i‚Äôve tried to look up similar occurrences but i haven‚Äôt found anything about the air recirculation button not wanting to turn on again.

[i guess the last thing id have to add is that my car started to make a faint bubbling noise]

the reason i added this information towards the end was because im not sure its a ac problem? 

not sure if that‚Äôs connected to my ac, coolant or oil.

i planned on changing my oil this week as the oil life was at 30%.

anyways, ANY insight or advice helps, looking to go to a shop to go do a ac check up tomorrow but if anyone could drop any insightful tips that can help me gain any general knowledge. it would be greatly appreciated!

1mge2t3,Help with Audi A6. Is it worth it?,"I just bought a 2004 Audi A6 with the 4.2L V8 engine. The car had been sitting for about a year. When I start the engine, it fires up quickly with no weird noises, shaking, or hesitation. There‚Äôs no blue or white smoke coming from the exhaust either. So far, the engine sounds healthy overall.

However, in Park or Neutral, the RPMs won‚Äôt go above 1000, even when I press the gas. When I drive it, especially on small streets, the car takes a while to pick up speed. But once I get on the freeway or open road, it drives fine, reaches 3000 RPM, and even hits 100 mph with no problem. So it feels like something is holding it back only at low speeds or idle could it be limp mode?

All the PRNDS lights on the dash are lit up at the same time, and in Reverse, it feels like the transmission ‚Äúkicks‚Äù a little or takes a second to engage. It also hesitated to shift one time after a stoplight. The OBD2 port doesn‚Äôt work right now, so I haven‚Äôt been able to scan for codes yet.

When I remove the oil cap while the engine is running, there‚Äôs a slight ‚Äúpshhh‚Äù sound like opening a soda bottle, and it actually pulls (sucks) air inward. There‚Äôs also a faint whistle or hiss near the engine, and the idle is unstable. No leaks underneath, but when I took off the skid plate, it had some greasy buildup and dirt near the alternator.

I was able to cut a piece of plastic the same width as the broken tab. Then attach the broken bracket the new piece of plastic with epoxy for plastic. The pieces will need to be scuffed and mating surfaces have to be fairly smooth for the pieces to bond together. The correct mix of epoxy will be important to how the repair holds. I also like to clean the pieces with acetone. It seems to help the bond. The longer you let the repair set, the better it will be. 

You would need to have some scrap abs plastic. Also will need something like a die grinder or Dremel to work the plastic. I have used the two part epoxy sold at most auto part stores.

The belts and hoses are likely just fine for getting the engine started. ¬†If you want to make it your daily driver, consider changing any belts on the front of the engine, because they‚Äôre likely due. ¬†Check on the recommended interval for changing the timing belt, if you have one.

I'm a keen caravan tourer, and on paper this looks like a great fit, with some excellent spec to boot. My thinking so far is:
* Towing: Decent power for the price, should handle a smaller caravan well.
* Comfort & Tech: Comes with heated seats, heated steering wheel, and a huge spec of other modern conveniences.
 * Looks: Subjective, but I think it looks pretty decent.
 * Running Costs: Insurance is at the lower end for me.

I'm definitely not a badge snob. I'd happily drive a Dacia tomorrow if they made a diesel estate that fit the bill. My comparisons so far:
 * BMW 3/5 series: An equivalent priced BMW would be an older model, likely smaller, with a better engine and ride, but with that comes older reliability concerns and a dated spec, especially when it comes to connectivity and safety features.
 * Ford Mondeo: I just don't think they have the same amount of room, and reliability surveys seem to put them below the Insignia.
 * Skoda Superb: This is the only real contender, but to compete on price, you're looking at the SE entry-level specs, which just don't come close to the list of features you get on this Insignia. And the Skoda seems to be ahead of the Passat, Arteon, and A4 which all share the same platform. They all look a bit bland also.

1mgr9qq,Talk me out of buying a Mazda 3 (2020-2022),"I'm moving to my first job with a half decent salary, and my current car (Hyundai i10) is on the fritz. 

I am looking for a decently efficient, comfortable car for day-to-day commuting, and to just feel like a bit of an upgrade over my Hyundai as I'm turning 30 next year and wanting something a bit more substantial. 

I've come across the Mazda 3, which looks like a great car, generally well kitted out, and (reportedly?) fairly reliable. 

That being said, counter my selection bias reddit. Why should/shouldn't I buy a Mazda 3 - and what alternatives would you suggest instead?",9,1754247316.0,9,CartalkUK,1754336275,2025-08-03 18:55:16,2025-08-04 19:37:55,"SirProcrastinator (Score: 9): As an owner of a Mazda3 myself for around 2 and a half years and covering around 26,000 miles, I'll list a few pros/cons from my perspective, starting with the cons first. Cons:

* Interior rattles - a lot of them have well documented fixes on various forums/subreddits and videos. I've fixed most of them bar two, one is the cupholder clips buzzing when there's a cup not pushing it all the way in, and another coming from the A pillar on the passenger side when the car is between 1500/2000 rpm, though I think I'm onto finding a fix for this one.
* Lack of torque - sometimes it just feels a bit gutless when you put your foot down and hit the artificial 4K ~~rpm~~ torque limit. I have considered getting the limiter removed, but I don't punch down often enough to offset the cost of removing this and declaring it to insurance.
* Boot - whilst the boot capacity is large, the shape isn't the best, and the lack of any useful features in the boot is a bit disappointing, e.g. hooks for shopping bags, no 12v for easy rear dash cam wiring.
* C pillars are huge - this makes rear visibility poor, but the cameras / blind spot monitor more than make up for it and I've never felt like I couldn't see round the back well enough.
* Rear legroom - if you have a driver/passenger with long legs, rear leg room isn't the best and feels quite cramped, not helped by the small windows in the hatchback, more so if you have privacy glass. Pros:
* Fantastic to drive - as a daily cruiser, the car is comfortable and relaxing to drive. You never feel like you have to put your foot down and you can cruise gently in relative quiet and comfort. When you do want a bit of fun, the SkyActiv G is peppy due to being N/A till it hits 4k and the power drops off. The steering is a bit on the ""heavier"" side, but it feels direct and precise. The auto gearbox is relatively smooth, not the quickest, but smooth enough for day to day traffic and with it being a torque converter, being able to switch between drive and reverse without having to wait for the clutch makes parking so much quicker. You won't be winning any traffic light Grand Prix but you can certainly have some fun.
* Tech - mine's the fully loaded GT Sport Tech with every single option apart from the burgundy leather (which if you can get, looks fantastic imo).
   * 360 cameras - makes parking incredibly easy and the definition is excellent
   * Blind spot monitoring - works as you'd expect if you've ever driven a car with it before, you can also configure how early/late it triggers
   * Bose sound system - 12 speakers sound absolutely fantastic, with great bass
   * Heads up display - honestly this is the one feature I don't think I could live without now, just being able to drive without looking at the gauge cluster makes such a world of difference
   * Radar cruise control - makes motorway driving an absolute breeze and with traffic jam assist, I don't even need to do anything in stop start traffic
* Interior design - this will be biased as an owner but I honestly think its one the best looking interiors in its class. Everything is so well thought out and driver focused. The lack of touchscreen is no issue at all and the commander knob makes everything so easy to use. It's sad to see Mazda dropping this in the future but I hope it will return.
* Comfort - everyone will have a different opinion on this, but I find the seats comfortable enough for me for long journeys. I don't ever finish a journey and think that felt uncomfortable, unless my back's playing up. The suspension is on the firmer side so you do feel bumps/cracks/potholes.
* Reliability - no mechanical faults whatsoever, aside from a door lock actuator failing, mirror motors failing (this was a design defect on the first 4th generation models that Mazda covered as part of an extended warranty) and a fault with the driver monitoring camera that required a software update. Only other costs have been servicing and consumables.
* MPG - according to Fuelio, I've averaged 36.2 mpg over 26,000 miles with a mix of town and motorway driving.

I have only ever been a buyer before, and when it does come time to sell its usually to a friend/family member.

It's a Polestar 2, asking for around ¬£21,000 or so.

Two main questions I have are aounrd test driving and payment. (But am open to anything else i should keep in mind.

For test drives, what should i expect/make clear?   
I have seen many answers but the main two seem to be either:

1. Proof of insurance and cash in hand ""you break it you buy it"" (and ride with them)
   1. ""cash in hand"" maybe not realistic for ¬£21k? (or maybe it is... This also relates to a payment question)
2. Temp insurance (such as ""Cuvva"") and noting that on the listing.
   1. Is this unrealistic? I can see it then only attracting keen buyers, but ive never had to (but then never bought a car over ¬£5k privately before)

Also, is it odd to ride with them? One so that they cant do anything dodgey to it, but also as a few may not be used to EVs or their quirks (OTP, etc) and need help. When i first got in it i didnt even know how to ""start"" the thing.



Then around payment... how best to do so for a large amount such as ¬£21k?

1. Do i accept cash and if so, how do i make sure it isnt fake.
2. Do i ask for bank transfer and not hand over keys/etc until money is in my bank (Even if they show me ""proof""

Always physically check they have insurance. Even more important given the value of the car. Always go with them on test drives. Sit in the back if you have to.

Bank transfer is safest. Chargebacks aren't possible on bank transfers. They might be able to query the payment but not through a chargeback.

Work out what they want out of the transaction and use it, often the dealer will make more in commission from the finance company and/or warranty and other extras than the car itself, use that  they can't discount the finance deal but they may be willing to pay a deposit contribution for example, or with extended warranties they often can't discount that but will take a hit off the car to entice you to take the warranty (which you can then cancel within the 14 day cooling off period).

*Cause:*  
*When the fuel is returned to the tank from the engine, it is deposited into the swirl pot to maintain the fuel delivery performance of thesystem.*  
*The recirculatedfuel is hot, so it may sometimes create a mist inside the tank.*

*This is a natural phenomenon and can only take place if all of the following conditions are met:*  
*Low fuel level in the tank (approximately 10 litres or less).*  
*Normal fuelling flow rate.*  
*A temperature difference of 50 degrees Centigrade (or 122 deg. Fahrenheit or 323 deg. Kelvin) between the fuel inside the swirl pot andthe fuel inside the tank (Example: An engine has been run shortly before refuellingand there was not enough time for the mist tocondensate inside the tank).*

1mglk6w,2mm Chip in Windowscreen - Advice Appreciated!,"Hi all,

Back in January, my car windscreen was the unfortunate victim of some road debris that caused a very small chip (about 2mm in size each way you measure it. Added my finger for scale lol).

I've kept my eye on it, and have since seen no growth, however my MOT is coming up at the end of September and I could really do with passing!

I had previously thought it'd be okay, but recently I've been wondering if you think this chip could cause issues with my MOT, and your opinion on how speedily I should look to get this fixed.

I still have time to get this sorted before my MOT if needs be, but I know that won't be the case for too much longer!

(For some extra information, I do have windscreen cover on my insurance, however that states that any chips need to be 3mm across or more to be eligible for repair, so I'm not sure they'd do much about this haha!)

Thank you for any advice I get on this :)

1mgl72v,Wrong no claims discount on insurance policy,"My car insurance renewal is due at the beginning of September and I've discovered a fuckup on my behalf about no-claims discount. I moved to the UK in 2020, bought my first car here in 2021 and have been driving since then. I was intermittently driving back home.¬†

Essentially I thought my insurance years of no-claims from Ireland was valid as both Admiral and subsequently Churchill said on their website they accepted NCDs from Ireland. I was looking at my documents and realised that my years of driving in Ireland are actually invalid as I was a named driver on my mother's policy rather than the owner of the policy (really stupid of me I know). I'm currently with Churchill and have been since 2023. I didn't really bother looking at any of my documents last year as my renewal quote was cheaper so I just let it auto-renew (also stupid I know). So effectively, I'm claiming for 7 years NCD when I should have really been claiming for 3 or 4 at most. None of them have ever actually asked for proof.

I'm just wondering about what the best way to go about this. I'm just a bit worried that if I tell Churchill that they will cancel the policy which will follow me forever. I'm willing to pay the difference for what I should have paid this year to correct it. The further issue is that the NCD on my previous policy with admiral is also incorrect so I would struggle to prove I've been driving with no claims for 4 years. Would I be better off just paying for a new policy with zero years of NCD even if it stings a lot?¬†

TL;DR: discovered I've been claiming on the wrong number of years for NCD. Should be claiming for 3-4, current policy is for 7 and due for renewal in 4 weeks.

If you have a genuine reason to justify getting one over taking public transport by all means go for it, but ask yourself if you really do need it vs one of the best places you could live for public transport options.

Even if you do think it might be nice to have a car every now and then, could joining a car club be a better solution? Then you have access whenever you want but pay by the hour or day and get a new car to drive around in and not worry about things like tax, insurance, servicing, repairs etc.

1) Any car could have problems. You CAN get a car for 2 to 3k and it may give you years of happy motoring. You may get one that ends up being nothing but trouble. Try sticking to the reliable Asian brands, not crazy high mileage, and signs that it's been looked after and it will be a good start. But be realistic. Have money set aside. 2 to 3 thousand is going to get you a fairly old car. Older cars WILL need some form of maintenance and repairs to keep it running.

2) Check the signage on your street and speak to neighbours. You'll probably need a permit. And you don't want to be risking it. Don't just take your chances. Most councils and private parking companies are on the ball with this and do regular patrols. You'll end up with fines stacking up very quickly if you go ahainst the parking regulations.

3) You're still quite young, and London is considered fairly high risk. Expect your insurance quotes to be high especially since you have no experience. Probably more than you're expecting.

Also one other reminder. Remember that ULEZ Compliance is something else you'll probably need to keep in mind, and may limit your options for cars at the cheaper end of the market too.

I recently sold my ULEZ compliant Corsa with 201,000 miles on the clock for ¬£500, and am confident it can do another 50k, cause I got it serviced every 6 months.

I dont suggest that here. the Corolla 2.0's hybrid system tends to reserve the engine for running at its most efficient speeds and instinctively this will lead to massively reduced wear.  

the fact that it is an Atkinson cycle engine also tends to mean slightly reduced wear as the internal pressures are moderated somewhat.
