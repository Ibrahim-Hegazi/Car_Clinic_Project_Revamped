1mgxshg,What should I do?,"I’m kind of stuck between selling my Miata or keeping it. It’s a 1990 NA with 90k miles and zero rust. Honestly, I haven’t driven it much in the two years I’ve owned it because it always seems to have some issue pop up, and I just haven’t had the time to really dig into it. So it ends up sitting for months at a time. Right now, it’s down again. We just replaced the fuel pump and ignition coil. The car has good compression it cranks, but it won’t fire. I’ve been told there are only a few things that could be causing it, so I don’t think it’s a major fix. Some people have suggested turning it into a drift car since the chassis is clean, but that doesn’t feel like the right move for me at the moment. I’ve had people tell me I’ll regret selling it, and I’m trying not to give up on it, but at this point, it just feels like a paperweight. I want to bring it back to life, but it’s hard to stay motivated when it’s been sitting for so long. The car has had some moisture problems so I’m wondering it has something to do with that.

1mgvz0r,Car stalling and making strange noise,Hi so a couple days ago my car was making more clicking sounds than normal and stalled when I went up a very small ramp. After letting it sit and trying the car again it would take a second to start up but eventually turn over. I was able to get home and the next morning the car was completely fine again to get to work but when I went home I tried to park my car and again went up a ramp at a slow pace and it stalled. I had to wait again to turn it on and park. Yesterday I was able to get to work and back with no problems but today I noticed the clicking noise was a little louder. I also got my battery checked and alternator and they are both in perfect condition. I also got a fix checked from AutoZone which I’ll attach to here.

1mggpqe,Engine Braking Mega-Thread,"Hi there, I'm posting this to see if we can come to a unified conclusion regarding the use of engine braking.

So here are the benefits and drawbacks I can think of right now:

Benefits:
-No brake pads wear
-No brake fade in downhills
-Responsiveness (RPM range)

Drawbacks:
-Higher RPM's = More wear ( and potentialy destructive if oil is not in operating temp. )
-Syncros increased wear if you don't properly rev match

So...

-Is it worth it if you don't rev match? 

In other words, do the wear of the syncros and of the overall increased engine wear makes engine braking worth it?

-How close to the redline are you once you stop engine braking and start using normal braking? Sometimes I think ""...I'm at 40km/h at 6000RPM, maybe it would be healthier for the car to stay at let's say 3000RPM and apply the good ol' brake pedal""

-I find it much more useful at high or medium speeds; at low speeds and rpm, it's harder to match the revs, and I think it just doesn't make much sense.

-The energy that the engine ""transforms"" through the effects of compression goes from kinetic energy to heat and noise, right? Could that combined energy (heat and noise) cause problems or overheating?

Let me know if I'm missing something.

Unless you live on top of a mountain this should not be a problem because the oil - and the metal that it lubricates & separates - should be at operating temperature and the clearances should be at spec, especially if you have just climbed the hill you are about to descend.




>Syncros increased wear if you don't properly rev match


I doubt that most people are rev-matching during normal driving. But if you're worried about wear to the synchros when engine braking then just rev-match when you downshift.




>How close to the redline are you once you stop engine braking and start using normal braking?


If you're getting too close to the redline the tap the service brakes to slow the vehicle down and bring RPMs down away from the redline. Engine braking is more effective at higher RPMs than at lower RPMs, so when the RPMs get low enough that engine braking isn't effective anymore you can always downshift and use engine braking in the next lowest gear.

1mg944i,Miata,"I hope this is allowed in this sub. I didn’t really know which flair to pick so I hope this is ok. 

To those of you who owned a Miata and sold it, did you regret it? Why did you sell it? 

I bought my 95 Miata about 5 years ago. Absolutely love it. I lived in a different state for two years and left my it at my parents, came back, drove it once and the clutch died (it was dying when I bought it, and I taught myself and my brother how to drive stick in it so it wasn’t a surprise). I have a friend who will help me fix it I just gotta buy the parts and wait for winter when the weather is nicer. It’s been sitting for a year since the clutch died. Since it’s been a while since I drove it regularly I’m debating on fixing it and selling it before I drive it again and fall in love with it all over again. I bought it when I wanted to be a car girl and learn how to work on cars. I still value learning how to work on it, but honestly I mostly keep it just cuz I genuinely enjoy driving it.

I’ve had so many people offer to buy it completely unprompted. Husband says if I do sell it I shouldn’t do it for the money, I should do it only if I don’t enjoy it anymore. He also really supports me keeping it forever, which has always been my plan until recently. He’s not a car guy, so I know he’s not biased. As of right now I’d be doing it for the money, since it’s got over 100k and I’m worried about cost of maintaining it over the next several years. It needs a new soft top, the aftermarket radio only partially works, and the previous owner replaced the original wheels with rims that I really don’t care for. I’ve always wanted to put original wheels back on it, but can’t really justify paying for something that the car technically came with originally, ya know? Other than that it’s completely stock. I do really love the car, and I bought it for dirt cheap thru the dealership I worked at before prices went wild, so you can’t really beat that nowadays either. Even writing this post I think I’m leaning toward keeping it, I just struggle with justifying the financial aspect. Am I being too cheap? At what point do I accept that sometimes happiness costs money and it’s worth it? My old daily I dumped around $10k into over the years to avoid buying a new car, and in hindsight I’m realizing I should have sold it way sooner, so I think that’s partially why I’m afraid to do the same thing with my Miata. But unlike the daily, I think the Miata would be worth it because of how fun it is (and its clean title, whereas my daily was not). Not to mention, it’s just my seasonal ride so I won’t be putting on as many miles. 

So anyways, to those of you who owned and then sold your Miata’s, did you regret it?

1mgx7gu,DO NOT trust Safelite Auto with your vehicle.,"Here's my nightmare story with Safelite. 

Technician came out for service on July 12th 2025. He wasn't super friendly or professional, multiple times it seemed like he was talking on the phone during the install via his airpods. As he walked up he nodded at me and then told me it would take 45 minutes to an hour.  
  
He then got to work without speaking any further. The tech during his windshield install cracked the drivers side trim and then went to the passenger side and completely broke the trim in half. When he finished the install, the tech went and took a photo of the drivers side trim piece as well as the passenger side trim piece. At the end of the install, very nonchalantly told me he damaged the trim pieces, he took me over specifically to the one that was broken in half and said to me ""When I was taking this off it did break, so we went ahead and ordered both panels"".

I then expected to hear from a representative either later that day or on Monday since it was a weekend. After the weekend and not having any further communication on July 14th I called the customer service to try to figure out the status. The gal on the phone was helpful and friendly. She ended up telling me that a service center was working on ordering both trim pieces and taking care of it.

On July 17th the local office called me and apologized for the inconvenience and told me they were working on getting those moldings in. He also informed me he was having a harder time finding them, I told him I would send him the links where I found them in stock, so I did. I even sent him the custom plastidip paint that I painted the car with. This plastidip also requires a special rig to paint with. He didn't respond to any of those messages.

The next day I followed up to that same number I sent the images and links to, no response. I heard nothing back until July 22nd when someone from that local office called me and left a voicemail saying he was waiting on ""those moldings"" (plural) to arrive. Then on July 25th I got a call from the local office telling me the molding(s) had arrived and to schedule a pick up.

I went down there on July 28th and they only had the passenger side molding for me. The man at the counter apologized and said they would get the driver side ordered asap. Then a few hours later I get a call and the assistant manager said that they weren't going to replace the drivers side because it was only a scratch. Furthermore they said that the tech should have told me since the vehicle age (2006), if he breaks something I am out of luck.

I would never have agreed to that, nor was I ever told such a thing, I have video proof.

The panel is not scratched, it is very clearly cracked. The representative on the phone was zero help, and told me they wouldn't be covering the damage they caused to my vehicle.

This is absolutely unacceptable.

on July 29th I called the main customer service number after that call and I got a hold of a gentleman where I explained thew entire dilemma. He said that he would send an email to the district managers, store managers, etc. I asked if I could forward this exact message above to him with videos and photos, he said yes and that I would probably receive a call that day or the next. 

Shocker, I did not receive a call. It is now August 3rd with no communication from their team. 

My car is a 2006, yes it is ""older"" it's also extremely well cared for and restored. It's not just some throw away car that they can break parts on and tell me to go pound sand. 

Do yourself a favor if you have a choice, stay as far away from these dirt bags as you can.

1mgtbte,Squeaking noise when driving over bumps,"I drive a 2017 Hyundai Sonata, base model, 2.4L 4 cylinder engine. 80,700 miles

This weekend I've been hearing a squeaking noise from the front drivers side while going over bumps and sometimes after turning.  It reminds me of when I had suspension work just last year. Last summer, I got a new control arm, struts, and sway bar links. A few days after I had the work done, knocking and squeaking noises came back,  and I had to get the sway bar links tightened. The noise went away after that, until this weekend anyway. 

I'm calling a mechanic tomorrow to find out what this squeaking could be caused by. I'll be really discouraged if it's the suspension again. Could I really need more suspension work after only 15,000 miles? I don't drive on unpaved roads. The car drives fine otherwise. And I don't hear the noise after every bump.

Do you think something could just need to be tightened, or could it be something else other than the suspension? I got new brakes and new tires in May.

1mgmn4u,Advice on Cam Carrier Reseal Repair,"2014 Subaru Impreza, 110,000 miles

Dealer advises that I do a cam carrier reseal, although they provided little detail on how bad it is.  Quoted $4000 for repair mostly labor, as I understand they have to take a lot of stuff out.

I have a slow oil leak, I am putting in about a quart of oil, or sometimes a bit more, between oil changes.  I do an oil change every 6 months and am generally under or right around 5000 miles when I go in.

I'm going to get an independent shop to look at it and quote.

I have a few questions, as someone who is very low knowledge when it comes to car repairs:

1.  Is this quote reasonable?  I'm guessing an independent shop can do it cheaper, but have no idea of what range is normal for this.

2.  What questions should I be asking the mechanic who looks at it?    
  
3.  Is this something that you can wait and see if it gets worse, or am I risking major damage?  I don't really want to do the repair right now, would like to wait at least six months due to other more pressing issues.

1mg9l5d,AGM vs FLA batteries,"2020 Nissan Sentra 2020 I am considering this: 
https://a.co/d/9BC0mbn

The first battery lasted about 2.5 years. 
The second battery lasted about 2.5 years.

I'm trying to figure out why.  Is it just normal or is it my usage patterns. 
I don't intentionally drain the battery but it happens from time to time.

I think ultimately if I keep working in the field and I'm always using my car as a mobile office, I will end up getting a second battery in my trunk.  

I think for now replacing the FLA with a AGM and specifically the yellow top one that I linked earlier would probably be my best option.   I try not to discharge the battery too much but sometimes things happen and I can't always control how long I'm sitting in my car, and don't always want to have the engine idling.

So I've been doing some research and I'm trying to verify this with anybody who understands electrical systems in cars. 

I'm viewing this problem with the skill set of a computer technician, and I really don't know much about car electronics except what is transferable into my expertise.

My understanding:

FLA - Flooded Lead-Acid  has been the standard car battery chemistry for many years and it's design is to function as a starting battery and cycling this battery and discharging it often can wear it out quicker.

AGM - Absorbed Glass Mat
It's more forgiving if you routinely discharge your battery either by accident or usage patterns. 

I don't have an upgraded audio system but I think my power use profile might be similar.  There are times when I will sit in the car with the radio on and the engine off for up to 30 minutes.

 I do have a pretty nice electronics charger in my car and I try not to plug too much stuff into it if the engine is not running but theoretically if I had a laptop and a phone and a tablet plugged into it it could be pulling 13.96 amps across the three devices. (Charger is rated at 167.5 w distributed across the three ports) The 12 volt socket on the car is rated at 15 amps, but I don't think car manufacturers anticipate that people will be routinely using this port close to capacity.

To complicate things a sensor in the door is  malfunctioning so I'm having to contend with making sure the lights in the car are off in addition to, the demands of summer air conditioning in the car and my normal high usage of power.  I'm wondering how fast the alternator in the car can replenish the battery and under normal conditions.  There's been a few times where I've totally drained the battery due to my light issue, and I think this is contributed to my most recent failure.  I think this summer has been the perfect storm, high on the battery while I'm driving, due to car electronics, charging devices, and air conditioning and then the alternator having to try to catch up after being totally drained from the lights.

From what I'm reading people with large power draws, are those who cycle the battery more often, should have a AGM batteries.

If someone reads this and has the expertise to explain and confirm or assess my thoughts to me that would be wonderful.",0,1754193099.0,3,autorepair,1754279353,2025-08-03 03:51:39,2025-08-04 03:49:13,"djltoronto (Score: 1): AGM is supposed to be more robust with respect to high depth of discharge.

In order to make it last longer, you need to reduce the frequency of occurrences of high depth of discharge events.  AGM should be more robust, but I wouldn't expect seven or eight years in your usage case, unless you change your habits. 

The current AGM battery in my Kia hatchback, is 7.5 years old and counting...

WesTxStoner425 (Score: 1): An idling Sentra doesn't use much gas; the hassle of a constantly discharging battery wouldn't be worth turning the car off imo. Chase down that light issue,  and maybe you could get away with a standard battery.

When my dad filled up the truck, the gauge was nearly empty, but he only filled the tank to about 3/4 full after adding the cleaner. He drove the truck for a day or two, then started noticing a slight loss of acceleration and some slipping while driving. Soon after, the check engine light came on.

Once I realized the tank hadn’t been completely filled, I went to top it off. At that point, the tank was about half full. When I unscrewed the gas cap, I heard a sizzling noise—like pressure releasing. While pumping gas, the tank would seem to fill up extremely quickly, causing the pump to shut off every few seconds. It kept doing this, making it difficult to add more fuel because the gas wasn’t going down into the tank as fast as usual.

I took the truck to a mechanic because of these fueling issues and the slipping I’d noticed. He ran a diagnostic scan, which pulled up code P0741. He mentioned there were three codes in total, but I only remember that one related to the torque converter. He advised me to keep driving the truck to burn off more fuel so he could check the gas tank and investigate further.

Here are my questions:

* Should I change the transmission fluid? Would that help?
* Did the fuel cleaner cause these problems, or is it just a coincidence and the truck had these issue already?
* What should i do?",0,1754197944.0,6,mechanic,1754279353,2025-08-03 05:12:24,2025-08-04 03:49:13,"Dangerous_Echidna229 (Score: 3): Use TOP TIER GAS and you won’t need to worry about additives.

KawazuOYasarugi (Score: 1): Uh... first, why?

Secondly, if you're doing that, I would recommend a floor jack. Bottle jacks have very small pads, so smaller surface area. Jack up the front or back first, not the sides, place your jack stands on solid frame or on jack points if you have the space. Make sure all jack stands are firmly in place, all feet on the ground, all pads/claws on the car firmly and flatly, none hanging off or partially on, and you're golden. Make sure you do this on completely level ground, and I personally like to use the jack itself to keep tension on the car as extra help if something does happen and it falls, that the jack may prevent it OR the jack is already under the car so that anyone assisting me can quickly get it back up, as a safety thing.

- 3M foamy adhesive and dual barrel caulk gun ($150 total on Amazon)

if you can find the frame specs for the car then you can check if the frame rail is still in place otherwise a bodyshop can measure it for you. based on the damage, I would be surprised if it moved. it looks like you peeled the fender off without major impact. check if the door is just sticking on the fender. if the a pillar or b pillar are damaged you are done. unibody is not really fixable in that state.

the most expensive parts will be the bumper and headlight. you can probably find aftermarket parts on the internet (check Amazon). get CAPA certified parts if not OEM and be prepared to get creative with a heat gun for fitting the bumper plastics together.

I've linked to the AutoTrader ad below, but it's a Vauxhall Insignia 2019 2.0T diesel with 48k miles, listed at £14,150.

http://www.autotrader.co.uk/car-details/202506243811226?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android-app

I'm a keen caravan tourer, and on paper this looks like a great fit, with some excellent spec to boot. My thinking so far is:
* Towing: Decent power for the price, should handle a smaller caravan well.
* Comfort & Tech: Comes with heated seats, heated steering wheel, and a huge spec of other modern conveniences.
 * Looks: Subjective, but I think it looks pretty decent.
 * Running Costs: Insurance is at the lower end for me.

I'm definitely not a badge snob. I'd happily drive a Dacia tomorrow if they made a diesel estate that fit the bill. My comparisons so far:
 * BMW 3/5 series: An equivalent priced BMW would be an older model, likely smaller, with a better engine and ride, but with that comes older reliability concerns and a dated spec, especially when it comes to connectivity and safety features.
 * Ford Mondeo: I just don't think they have the same amount of room, and reliability surveys seem to put them below the Insignia.
 * Skoda Superb: This is the only real contender, but to compete on price, you're looking at the SE entry-level specs, which just don't come close to the list of features you get on this Insignia. And the Skoda seems to be ahead of the Passat, Arteon, and A4 which all share the same platform. They all look a bit bland also.

Weird thing is when I plug my old radio back in it works perfectly, so I haven’t fried any fuses etc. 

I’m wondering if Vauxhall Corsa D’s have factory fitted amplifiers which require a power supply, and my new radio isn’t supplying the correct feed to the amplifier. But I can’t find one in any of the expected places in my vehicle. 

Also, the speaker wires going into the car don’t match from positive to negative, so I’m a bit concerned the last owner of my car has messed about with the speaker wires going into the car. The two wires on the adapter (right side) in the image, one is blue and black and the other is yellow, but according to the wiring schematic they head to the same speaker RR. I would expect them both to have a shared colour usually? also, the iso block from my car has 8+5 connection female pins but the adapter has 8+6 male connectors, the extra one which is marked “AR” on the wiring schematic. I feel like if it wasn’t needed, there wouldn’t be a spade on the connector. 

Forgive me for the queries, I just want to get this thing to work. Anyone in here installed a radio into a Corsa D that has any kind of help they can offer to get sound out the speakers?

Take an untreated car from Japan and stick it on a UK road each winter and they’ll rust very fast.

Cons:

* Interior rattles - a lot of them have well documented fixes on various forums/subreddits and videos. I've fixed most of them bar two, one is the cupholder clips buzzing when there's a cup not pushing it all the way in, and another coming from the A pillar on the passenger side when the car is between 1500/2000 rpm, though I think I'm onto finding a fix for this one.
* Lack of torque - sometimes it just feels a bit gutless when you put your foot down and hit the artificial 4K rpm limit. I have considered getting the limiter removed, but I don't punch down often enough to offset the cost of removing this and declaring it to insurance.
* Boot - whilst the boot capacity is large, the shape isn't the best, and the lack of any useful features in the boot is a bit disappointing, e.g. hooks for shopping bags, no 12v for easy rear dash cam wiring.
* C pillars are huge - this makes rear visibility poor, but the cameras / blind spot monitor more than make up for it and I've never felt like I couldn't see round the back well enough.
* Rear legroom - if you have a driver/passenger with long legs, rear leg room isn't the best and feels quite cramped, not helped by the small windows in the hatchback, more so if you have privacy glass. Pros:
* Fantastic to drive - as a daily cruiser, the car is comfortable and relaxing to drive. You never feel like you have to put your foot down and you can cruise gently in relative quiet and comfort. When you do want a bit of fun, the SkyActiv G is peppy due to being N/A till it hits 4k and the power drops off. The steering is a bit on the ""heavier"" side, but it feels direct and precise. The auto gearbox is relatively smooth, not the quickest, but smooth enough for day to day traffic and with it being a torque converter, being able to switch between drive and reverse without having to wait for the clutch makes parking so much quicker. You won't be winning any traffic light Grand Prix but you can certainly have some fun.
* Tech - mine's the fully loaded GT Sport Tech with every single option apart from the burgundy leather (which if you can get, looks fantastic imo).
   * 360 cameras - makes parking incredibly easy and the definition is excellent
   * Blind spot monitoring - works as you'd expect if you've ever driven a car with it before, you can also configure how early/late it triggers
   * Bose sound system - 12 speakers sound absolutely fantastic, with great bass
   * Heads up display - honestly this is the one feature I don't think I could live without now, just being able to drive without looking at the gauge cluster makes such a world of difference
   * Radar cruise control - makes motorway driving an absolute breeze and with traffic jam assist, I don't even need to do anything in stop start traffic
* Interior design - this will be biased as an owner but I honestly think its one the best looking interiors in its class. Everything is so well thought out and driver focused. The lack of touchscreen is no issue at all and the commander knob makes everything so easy to use. It's sad to see Mazda dropping this in the future but I hope it will return.
* Comfort - everyone will have a different opinion on this, but I find the seats comfortable enough for me for long journeys. I don't ever finish a journey and think that felt uncomfortable, unless my back's playing up. The suspension is on the firmer side so you do feel bumps/cracks/potholes.
* Reliability - no mechanical faults whatsoever, aside from a door lock actuator failing, mirror motors failing (this was a design defect on the first 4th generation models that Mazda covered as part of an extended warranty) and a fault with the driver monitoring camera that required a software update. Only other costs have been servicing and consumables.
* MPG - according to Fuelio, I've averaged 36.2 mpg over 26,000 miles with a mix of town and motorway driving.

For test drives, what should i expect/make clear?   
I have seen many answers but the main two seem to be either:

1. Proof of insurance and cash in hand ""you break it you buy it"" (and ride with them)
   1. ""cash in hand"" maybe not realistic for £21k? (or maybe it is... This also relates to a payment question)
2. Temp insurance (such as ""Cuvva"") and noting that on the listing.
   1. Is this unrealistic? I can see it then only attracting keen buyers, but ive never had to (but then never bought a car over £5k privately before)

Also, is it odd to ride with them? One so that they cant do anything dodgey to it, but also as a few may not be used to EVs or their quirks (OTP, etc) and need help. When i first got in it i didnt even know how to ""start"" the thing.



Then around payment... how best to do so for a large amount such as £21k?

1. Do i accept cash and if so, how do i make sure it isnt fake.
2. Do i ask for bank transfer and not hand over keys/etc until money is in my bank (Even if they show me ""proof""

Work out what they want out of the transaction and use it, often the dealer will make more in commission from the finance company and/or warranty and other extras than the car itself, use that  they can't discount the finance deal but they may be willing to pay a deposit contribution for example, or with extended warranties they often can't discount that but will take a hit off the car to entice you to take the warranty (which you can then cancel within the 14 day cooling off period).

I looked at x1s and went for an x3 instead as I found them a bit small, and we only have a small dog, no kids!

Although it was also about the build quality, i found the interior of the x3 noticeably nicer.

*Title AJ200 Fuelmisting when filling with fuel*  
*Category Engine*  
*Last modified 04Nov2015*  
  
*Symptom 404000 Fuel System Concerns*  
  
*Content Issue:*  
*Fuel misting may be seen from the fuel tank filler neck, with the fuel filler cap removed and when filling with Diesel fuel. Discovery Sport &Evoque 2.0 I4 Diesel (AJ200).*  
  
*Cause:*  
*When the fuel is returned to the tank from the engine, it is deposited into the swirl pot to maintain the fuel delivery performance of thesystem.*  
*The recirculatedfuel is hot, so it may sometimes create a mist inside the tank.*  
*When the car is refuelled,the mist may escape through the filler neck and can be seen with a naked eye.*  
  
*This is a natural phenomenon and can only take place if all of the following conditions are met:*  
*Low fuel level in the tank (approximately 10 litres or less).*  
*Normal fuelling flow rate.*  
*A temperature difference of 50 degrees Centigrade (or 122 deg. Fahrenheit or 323 deg. Kelvin) between the fuel inside the swirl pot andthe fuel inside the tank (Example: An engine has been run shortly before refuellingand there was not enough time for the mist tocondensate inside the tank).*  
  
*Action:*  
*No action required. Typically such gentle mist may form and escape the fuel tank if the above conditions are met.*
