1msblhp,What’s up with my alignment?,I have a 2015 Honda Civic Coupe LX that I bought a couple months ago. The post purchase inspection came back with nothing except an alignment recommendation. I decided to hold off on the alignment until I replaced the my tyres which I did a few days ago. Alignment was still off (steering wheel tilts right and car pulls right) afterwards and I took it back to the shop that initially did it to recheck. Apparently the front right strut is pretty new but the left one isn’t. He also said the rear shocks were going bad. I made a post in the CarMax sub asking if it would be covered under warranty since the mechanic said my alignment can’t get any better with the suspension system as is.

Collapsed strut mount or worn out control arm bushings are usually the cause of those being out, and new parts usually put them back to spec.

Front toe is adjustable. Worst case the tie rods could be siezed up and need replacing, but the steering wheel should be able to be set straight with toe to spec.

My brain is fried from working outside all day today so I can't remember which suspension setup your year should have, but camber will not be adjustable... it won't cause a pull but will cause the inner edge to wear faster. Iirc you have a divorced spring and damper (spring is separate from the shock) and if so, I'd start with new spring seats, the rubber isolators on the top and bottom of the spring. They wear out and collapse and can cause your camber problem.

Your rear toe should be adjustable.

ZepheriusSwitchgasm (Score: 1): I'm sure it does not help that you have a few fins that are bent and not allowing air through them. You could try to get something called a fin comb and comb out the fins and see if that solves the problem. It could be an obstruction or an issue with your heater core. You could also use a hose bypass kit and just run water through it to see if the problem improves or gets worse. I don't know how old the vehicle is, but I would have to say that the obstruction could be what prior owners may have used to fix a situation, like a leaking radiator called Stop Leak. I would never recommend using that stuff. It will clog the orifices that run through your engine to keep it cool. It could also be a bad coolant temperature sender causing an issue. Also you may want to make sure that the thermostat was rated properly for that vehicle 5 degrees can be a difference between opening and staying closed. This could also cause an engine to overheat. It could be several things, so without seeing it in person, it would be difficult to diagnose. I think that your radiator fins are not your problem, though. I would start with making sure that the thermostat was rated properly for that vehicle and try to run a bypass on it and hook a garden hose up to it to run it for a few minutes to see if the water is comming out properly on all sides."

1ms7a3l,EFI Fuse keeps blowing,"Hello everyone,

About a month ago, I bought a 2001 Toyota Avensis T22 with the 1.8 L 1ZZ-FE engine. The car had 138,000 km on it when I bought it, and now it’s at 139,000 km.

The check engine light (CEL) is constantly on because the fuel pump fuse keeps blowing. When the fuse blows, the engine won’t start until the fuse is replaced. After replacing it, the CEL goes off immediately, and the car can drive for about 30 km without any warning. However, after roughly 100 km, the fuse blows again. The Code of the Check Engine Light is always P0420, but however, after changing the O2 Sensors and Checking the Cat, we could not find any Problem down there. 

At first, this mostly happened during high-speed highway driving over 160 km/h, but now it also occurs during normal, relaxed driving.

The fuel pump has already been replaced with a used one from eBay, but the problem still persists.

Does anyone have any tips or advice on what could be causing this and how to fix it?

An 8.8 bolt from the hardware store is a material property class, not a torque number.

The repair manual would list about 82 *inch-pounds* installation torque for the water pump bolts for that car's engine.

(Those bolts are probably M6x1.0 thread size, but that can be confirmed separately.)  Three of them are short, three are long on that engine.  They need to go back in their correct mounting spots.  Original Toyota bolts are the right ones, to guarantee there's no funky corrosion after installation.

If the wrong bolt thread size was used, those bolts could be really stuck tight in there.  That would suck.

For any removal technique, the main concern is: don't mar the pump gasket mating surface.  The first round attempt for any protruding sheared bolts would be a Vamplier type of extraction pliers: https://www.reddit.com/r/harborfreight/comments/18visfb/screw_extracting_pliers_comparison/

For flush or recessed sheared bolts, without a welder, use a sharp cobalt drill bit to carefully center an aligned hole for a small-bolt extractor.  Skinny drill bits and skinny extractors break easily.  They demand great care.  You'd also stuff a stopper into water openings, to prevent metal bits entering inside.

And of course follow the water pump installation procedure when the bolts are all ready for installation, including whatever they list as the pump pre-soak time."

Euresko (Score: 2): If tpms comes on that generally indicates a bad tire pressure sensor with a weak/dead battery or low tire pressure (nail puncture). If you have that triggered I think that vsa comes on because if the car doesn't know the correct tire pressure (or it's low, because of a nail) then you can't have the vehicle stability working (vsa). If you didn't have a tire with low pressure (no nail), it's not a huge deal, but may impact the safety features in wet or icy road conditions. On that older vehicle it's not smart enough to show each tires pressure like other cars, so you'd have to check with a tire gauge, if you didn't have a nail in a tire. Anyway, go get the tire patched ASAP. It should be able to be safely patched if it only went through the tread. If it went through a sidewall you'd want to replace it. Once you have that properly fixed, and have proper air pressure in all 4 tires the lights will go off after you drive about a block going 30mph or so. "

To read a dipstick, withdraw it and wipe it clean.  Re-insert it fully, pause a second and withdraw it.  When withdrawing it, immediately move it to a level horizontal position to prevent oil from flowing up or down the stick. 

Carefully examine both sides of the stick looking for the lowest level where oil fully covers that side of the stick with no dry spot.  Whichever side of the stick reads the lowest level, is the side you use to determine the level of the oil.

1ms4klr,"MYSTERY, NEED ADVICE! 1.9 PD TDI overheating, suspicious heater core.","Audi a4b5 2000

Temps reach up to 106 °C and the “Check coolant level, stop engine” warning appears when the car heats up. Before, the warning only popped up for a short time, but now it happens consistently.

Coolant seems to flow through the breather hose only when the engine is revved.

Before I noticed the overheating, I thought it was just a sensor problem.

Long story short – the car has a new water pump, coolant level sensor, coolant reservoir (with sensor), and a new thermostat.

My theory was that there was some kind of airlock in the system, because the radiator and the hoses under the expansion tank and radiator were much cooler than the hoses in the small cooling circuit.
To eliminate the thermostat, I removed it completely – as a result, the car only reached a maximum of 70 °C and coolant visibly flowed through the breather hose. BUT the “Check coolant, stop engine” warning still appeared occasionally, though only after a while and not all the time.

When the thermostat is reinstalled, the same problem comes back – overheating and the warning.

After checking the hoses, I found that the heater core’s plastic hose nipple (see picture) had been shattered by a previous owner. Originally, this part is meant for bleeding air from the system. I thought that plastic shards from it might have entered the system and partially blocked the flow, but after blowing through multiple hoses and checking the small passages in the cooling circuit, I couldn’t find any blockage or plastic pieces.

My FINAL theory now is that because of the damaged plastic hose nipple (see picture), the connecting rubber hose doesn’t fit snugly, allowing air into the system and causing my problems.
My plan is to connect the two hoses going in and out of the heater core directly, bypassing the heater core, to test this theory. If that doesn’t solve it, I’m out of ideas.",1,1755371277.0,6,MechanicAdvice,1755459265,2025-08-16 19:07:57,2025-08-17 19:34:25,"FixxerAuto (Score: 1): THat is a solid plan, I might add that you should do a block test to rule out combustion gasses in the system as the source of the overheat- The test kit is a rental tool at Oreilly's"

Car is Buick Lucerne cxl 2007. I had a brake job done before a long road trip, where I got the brake pads changed. a couple weeks after that I took the car on the road trip (2000 miles)

1ms4y20,Is my car more likely having engine or transmission related issue based on the symptoms?,"2015 VW Passat with 120K on the odometer right now. Mostly highway miles from driving to and from work. Car currently has active check engine light along with EPC light and traction control light on. The car is extremely jerky especially when at idling. Think of a massage seat…. So I try not to idle as much since it’ll start making my head go dizzy with all the jerking. Car also is having acceleration issues, whenever the car comes to a stop for a prolonged time (for example at a red light) I’ll have to push the gas pedal all the way down for the car to get moving again. Once it’s moving, it’ll sometimes lose all its power and almost slowly de-accelerate by itself, unless I keep slamming on the gas pedal, which then I’ll feel a strong force trying to get it to accelerate, like driving against super high wind. But then it’ll suddenly have a major surge of power which will make my head go forward. This will keep happening when driving locally. On highway where the speed limit goes up to 80 mph it’s slightly better. However the car continues to shake and jerk non stop no matter what. Like to the point where you can hear my voice shake if I’m speaking. The car also has a loud popping sound when turned on coming from the exhaust I think. What could be the likely causes? All spark plugs replaced. One out of 4 coil packs replaced. I will eventually have to take it to a shop but want to have a basic idea of what all the causes are.

-TinyTM- (Score: 2): Prius expert here, I own a 2014 just like you. You don't need to take it to a mechanic to check 99% of the major issues this car has (it only really has 3 issues). Aside from suspension, you're looking at 3 super easy tests you can do in your driveway, most being free. 

Firstly, let the car sit overnight, it's important for the following tests. When you walk up to the car and unlock it in the morning, you can hear it make a ""grunting"" noise for a few seconds after opening the door. That's your ABS actuator pressurizing. These are known to leak and if yours is grunting without brake pedal input, after you start the car and let it sit, it may have issues in the future. As for what happens when it does break (at least in the eyes of the cars computer), you'll lose ABS, traction control and regenerative braking. Extremely minor issue and you can drive the car around for months with the lights on the dash with no long term effects, I drove my personal car for 3 months, then replaced it. No big deal. 

Secondly, when you first start the car in the morning, does it make a loud rattling noise that goes away after a few seconds? (it will sound like the motor is trying to shake itself apart) it could be an indicator of a few potential issues. One, which is the most likely, is a bad PCV valve draining oil into the intake. Replace the valve, clean the intake and install an oil catchcan from the intake to the PCV valve, and the issue will clear up. Secondly, your EGR valve could be dirty/clogged. Removing and cleaning it is pretty much free, just a can of oven degreaser, or a pressure washer if you have one (makes this job so much easier). Clean the whole EGR system while you're at it. And lastly, the hardest to fix (and the one most people incorrectly assume is the issue when you get the ""death rattle"" on cold starts) the engine has a blown head gasket and you have coolant leaking into your cylinders overnight. There's a super easy way to tell if this is the issue, just mark the coolant level on the tank with the pink liquid near the passenger side with a bit of tape and drive the car like normal for a week. If the level goes down, the head gasket is most likely the issue. 

And lastly, this one is going to cost a little to check (50$ or so) but is the most important IMO, the health of the hybrid battery. The easiest way to check this at home is with a Bluetooth OBD2 scanner and the Dr. Prius app. You can do a full life expectancy test in about 10 minutes and get a ""% life remaining"" on your hybrid battery. Aside from that, focus on internal resistance and voltage difference. If one block of your battery has really high internal resistance and high cumulative delta voltage (no need to know what these words mean, it's just a label for the category on the bar graph, basically just look for a bar that is way higher or lower than the rest) that block is bad and may need replacement in the future. Anything above 60% means your battery will be good for a few years. It is a paid app, but you can also disable the annoying reverse beeping, and ""no seatbelt"" beeping, which makes it worth the 10$. 

If you just make sure these 3 issues aren't present, it'll run another 50k miles trouble free."

1ms8yut,4 wheel drive fitted unnecessarily to cars,"Hey everyone, first time poster I am sharing my unpopular opinion as I want to see how others view my thoughts too. My mum has had loads of Ssangyong Korandos (if you are from outside Europe/Asia they are a budget SUV that is sold here in UK and many other countries). This is her 5th Korando and this one has 4WD. It’s on decently low profile tyres that would have no off road capabilities at all. In addition to that it’s on pretty basic suspension.

Anyone who has off road experience in Ssangyongs please let me know what it was like 😂.

1msbjk0,Recharging AC for the first time - overfull or something else?,"Our 2013 Ford Fiesta was not blowing really cold air at all times so I got a R134a recharge kit with pressure meter thinking it probably just needed a recharge.  With the engine idling and the AC on max + recirculating, I hooked the gauge up to the low pressure line - but did not attach the can of R134a.  When the compressor kicks on the pressure shows at right about 50, but when it turns off the pressure creeps to 80-90.  Consequently I have **NOT** added any charge to the system.  Is this normal?  Really hoping that it is.  However if the AC is fully charged that illustrates another issue.

At idle the AC blows neutral air, no cooling happens until the car is moving.  Does not appear to be low idle or something because when parked, raising the RPM to 1500-2000 has no effect; the AC still blows neutral.  But once you get moving it cools appropriately.  We've had the car for about 8 months and have used the AC for the past two months at least.  If the previous mechanic somehow overfilled the R134a would the compressor continue to work, and for how long?  I understood that overfilling would destroy the compressor.

The a/c system does not “make cold”, what it does is REMOVE HEAT, it absorbs heat from inside the car, compresses it (making it extremely hot) and then uses the condenser to disperse this heat outside. 

The most common issue (based on your description and the way it runs this is most likely), the Freon does break down over time, but the ONLY thing that should be in there is Freon, so those “recharge kits” are just a cheap knockoff bandaid AT BEST. The system should be properly recovered (all Freon sucked out) and then put into a vacuum for around 30 minutes. This is to get all moisture and any other contamination out of the system. Then it should be properly recharged with the correct amount of Freon. I would recommend going to a decent shop to have all of this done as an a/c recharge.

Replacing like for like is something that you can do if your current  engine has died. It is not likely something that would be worth paying a mechanic to do though as it would likely be cost prohibative.

Changing for an engine that the car didn't come with is a whole other level of hassle. It can be done, but it's not something I would entertain on a car like this. Even then, these modifications then require further modification to other parts, as the car was never intended to have that engine fitted.

It's generally cheaper and easier to buy a faster car, rather than doing major upgrades to the one you have. 

Your money is best put into things like maintenance such as replacement of worn suspension components, tyres etc and accepting it for what it is.

I like to get a car or bike to good mechanical condition in stock form to start with. If it's got tired suspension, poor functioning brakes, worn bushes etc, then there's no point in trying to add power when it's worse than it came from the factory.

I’ve had this truck for two years. It has 237,xxx miles. It was to replace my truck that got destroyed just as a work truck and due to circumstances became my daily last summer. I let it sit over winter 2023-2024 and only started it a couple times. Had to replace the battery last year. After about a month or so of daily driving, I got a misfire in cylinder 3 code. This also came with the truck idling rough when in gear. Like at a stop light. The truck also rarely ever starts on the first turn. It’ll start immediately on the second turn but hardly ever on the first. I replaced the spark plugs and wires. Thought that took care of it and then a code came back again but it was now a too many misfires code. I replaced the mass air flow sensor and the air filter. Neither of those fixed it.

Cut to this year, I’ve been driving it daily(7 miles round trip) with the too many misfires code still present. Yesterday I finally had the time to do some more work. I pulled all the plugs because I had a suspicion that the gal was incorrect. They were in fact gapped to .040” and should’ve been at .060”. They are all now correctly gapped and replaced. I also replaced the throttle position sensor and the alternator and serpentine belt. These also did not get rid of the code or the rough idling. I put 12 oz of seafoam injector cleaner concentrate in last night on a full 34 gallon tank that will take me a couple of months to work through. I have a fuel filter that I’ll put on when I can get to the fuel filter. I’m kind of at a loss at this point for what I should be doing. I’ve heard possibly the piston rings are fried but the truck doesn’t smoke let alone anything funny colored. It doesn’t leak oil, I never have any temperature issues, the battery that’s in it is in good shape.

2.  Since you said it smells like fuel a lot that means that fuel isnt being burned properly. Therefore no Spark is getting to the cylinder. 

The issue could be as simple as a 
-spark plug failed 
-ignition coil failed

Diagnostic and solve would be to remove the spark plug and check for unburnt fuel smell. (Aka injector probably good)
Then use another (new or swap from another cylinder) spark plug(in case it failed) and turn on the engine. If issue persists then swap over ignition coil from another cylinder. If issue still persists then it can be electrical. This is where you stop and find a professional.

It's scary as crap when the tie rod disconnected and I was only going 35. 

I'm taking it back to performance shop for the ""Engine rebuild oil change"". And gave them a heads up that we have possible tie rod or related issues again. 

Now, dealership after spending 30 minutes with car listening and driving with me and inspecting wheel ""jump"" when turning steering etc advised I take it to the performance shop since they may take responsibility. Car has 60k miles. Aside from engine issues, nothing ever wrong with suspension or steering or trans. 

If they won't cover it or either way, I'm taking back to the dealership for inspection of their work  

TL;Dr;
Tie rod came off a week after I had engine rebuilt and car performance power modified at Performance Shop.  Place fixed it but said they did not touch tie rod because they lowered engine and did not need to disconnect tie rods. 
Now, 3:weeks later, symptoms indicate problem with same side axle. Would you bother going back there in case they cover it?  And or would you also go to the dealership or another trusted mechanic

1msb65i,I Need Help/Clarification/Advice??,"I am sorry in advance for how long it is but not sure exactly what is 100% necessary or useless information pertaining to this problem. 

I have a 2008 Chevrolet Malibu LS 2.4l. Automatic
A little history of the issue:
~July 2022 My starter stopped working. I was told by Autozone guy a little before it went out that the battery i purchased the car with wasn't a strong enough battery and could cause issues with the altenator or starter. Could replace the battery right then but soon after starter stopped. Replaced the battery with the needed battery and the starter.

~August 2022 there were 2 cam sensors were replaced that got the check engine light to turn off. It came back on by the next day and was told that it was probably due to the other 2 sensors needing replaced (the variable cam sensors) which due to a situation that annoys the fuck out of me still to this day, they never got replaced. 

~July 2024 Starter died again. Got the warranty replacement part and replaced the starter. As far as I am aware, should be the same battery i bought in 2022. 
Although since 2023 my bf was the main driver of my car. I drive less than 500 miles in about 6 months. So I can only go off what my car needs during those times. Unfortunately, my bf didn't keep up on maintenance as it should have been (i won't get started on that) but did replace the light switch inside the car beside the steering wheel, replaced break pads, and fixed some issue when a piece from the tire well some how fell and lodged in the tire while driving keeping the tire from being able to roll. Along with not enough oil changes. Could have switched the battery at some point but not to my knowledge. 

~August 2025 i believe the starter died again (haven't gotten confirmation but no cracks, lights turn on, when thought it was the battery and tried to jump it nothing changed. You turn the key, you can hear 1 click that sounds like a switch and light turn on as normal ( including the ""out"" headlight) 

***Things that may or may not be helpful to know** roughly 30,000 miles have been driven in about 2 years (i could be wrong but that seems right cause I remember when it hit 200,00) I don't know for sure if the starter was replaced before I bought it in july 2021 but could find out if needed too. Before the 2nd starter went out, the exhaust manifold cracked and has not been replaced. Bf did try a few things to fix it but they only helped a little and not for long. After the 2nd starter died Cv axels started saying they need to be replaced and not been replaced. As mentioned the light turn switch was replaced in April 2025. Driver front headlight replaced twice in the last 18 months and ""out"" again now. 

~July - August 2025 There has been things I have noticed. 1.Driver side head light has gone out 3 times in less than 2 years but not the passenger side. Most recently when it went out the 3rd time in July I noticed most the time it doesn't work but there are times it does. Including the other night when the car wouldn't turn on even when jumper cables were being used from a truck to mine. 
2. After light turn switch was replaced the battery died very often as if lights were left on or something. I pointed out to the bf that I realized when the new light switch was barley touched (very gental barley a touch at all) it would turn the head lights on and off. So told him I thought that was the problem. Which is guess he fixed cause hasn't been an issue since. 
3. This one i have noticed for about 2 years now but really been paying more attention more this year....I have noticed when the car is on and parked, if the over headlight inside the car are turned on they almost flicker. Like a dimmer that keeps going up and down just enough to where it bugs my light sensitivity that causes headaches. 

Due to the info above I personally have been feeling there is some kind of wiring issue that has essentially been the underlying cause of many of these things. Even when doing research on the car, starters, other issues that could cause starters to die, and so on, one of the few common issues that I would see is wiring. 
BUT (this is where my problem comes in)

My bf does not and for the first time since we met over 3 years ago and been dating a year, we actually had an argument and it was over this disagreement. 

My bf (not a mechanic just works on his own cars and googles what he doesnt know) says he has looked it up and found that the 08 malibus are known for having issues with the starters that is caused by a faulty design. A common issue that could even cause a starter to be dying every year. (i thought the first replacement was done in 2023 until I checked my facts for this post) That is just what the design of the car does and it's known problem. And he ended the argument with sell it and buy a Ford. 
Me >>> 🤢🤢 
Even if i tried to take that advice (well not the buy a Ford part)
I don't believe the car would sell for enough to turn around and buy another car in full. Couldnt get a car loan even if i wanted to which i dont. Considering the car doesn't start and needs repairs maybe even more than i am aware of, the check engine light on still and currently sitting with 2 flat front tires cause the person who drives it the most doesn't see my car as a top priority (he has his own car) unless he needs to use it.. 😒

So, help me out here. Being the mechanics based on the info given.... is he right? Have you heard of this faulty design that causes the starters to die basically every year??
Am I thinking in more the right direction and could be wiring??
Are neither of us right and you can tell me what it is? Or tell me what needs to be done to narrow down what it is? School starts in 9 days and I would prefer not having to walk in almost 100 degrees to drop off and pick up my kid from school. So any info would be AMAZING. And settling this debate would be perfect (especially if I am right or we are both wrong 🤣) 

Thanks for reading my story and if you made it this far and can help, you are a hero!

Here’s what info I DO have:
-250,000 miles
-on cold start is when the noise can be heard (I’m not sure if the noise goes away though once it heats up, but I’ve been told it doesn’t)
-oil leak is present, oil level barely touches the hash marks on the dipstick. Smokey mist coming from the tube when I took the dipstick out
-relative compression test shows that everything is all good
-monitored fuel injector pids on the datalogger, and all of them match up with each other
-disabled each injector and the noise gets quietest when cylinder 4 injector is disabled.

My best guess with the limited knowledge I have is that this oil leak has been going on long enough to where engine components near the top of the engine have been starved of proper lubrication and are now worn out and making noise.

1msai6i,Changed turbo but faced work low oil pressure warning.,"Hey, I bought a car that needed a turbo charger, which has been replaced but during the test drive there was still alot of smoke from the exhaust and the oil pressure warning came on. The turbo was boosting.

Today, the sump came off but the oil pump looks fine, was working, although, there was grit in the area. It's a wet belt oil pump.

It's a 1.5 Ecoboost Engine, chain timing belt but a wet belt for the oil pump.

Someone has previously had the sump off, and tried to pry the mesh off by the looks of the mark on the mesh surround. I believe they do come off on the puretec engine.

There was nothing overly concerning. The belt looked fine. Looking at the service history, the previous owners garage had used the wrong oil from day one of it being new, maybe this messed the turbo up? The propeller on the exhaust side was completely sheered off.

But, would this also damage the oil pump and the wet belt? Would a blocked oil pickup or no pressure immediately damage the turbo and not the engine? 

The car has never overheated, whilst waiting for the turbo to get done, I have had the car started and let it warm up more than once, it never went too hot.

All the lines were clear too.

What could have caused the oil pressure warning? Is there any other damage to the engine I should look out for?

I’ve already replaced LED bulbs with the original halogens, had a complete tuning done (fuel pump, injectors, throttle body, spark plugs cleaned/replaced, catalytic converter cleaned), and even installed a new car tracker because the old tracker had battery issues. The alternator was tested by an electrician and confirmed to be working correctly (not undercharging or overcharging).

1mrnoj5,"Tie rod ends replaced, top strut mounting replaced, but still a knocking noise - and now wheels out of alignment/steering wheel not straight","Car: Ford Focus 2020, 89,000 miles, 1.4L, manual.

Hey, recently have had some repairs on my car. I had two separate/distinct ""knocking"" noises.

First was remedied by replacing the tie rod ends, second was remedied by replacing the top strut mount.

All good, the main knocking noises I could hear are gone now, at first.

However.. There's now **another** knocking noise. It's far less frequent, and happens when going over uneven ground mostly. I'm aware that it's probably another suspension component that needs replacing.

It's like a rattling, knocking sound coming from underneath the car.

But the crux of my question is: could this be related to the steering wheel now being significantly out of line? As in, when I'm driving straight it's at quite a severe angle to the right (it's not straight at all, far from it).

I didn't notice this problem (uneven steering wheel) at all when I first picked the car up 3 weeks ago, but it's blatantly obvious now. 

Can wheel alignment creep out so suddenly due to failing suspension components? I've not hit any potholes or anything like this. I'm aware I may need a wheel alignment now, which I can get, but I'm worried it'll just end up out of sync again in a few weeks, is that possible?",1,1755327822.0,4,AskMechanics,1755459265,2025-08-16 07:03:42,2025-08-17 19:34:25,"SlowDownToGoDown (Score: 1): Did you get an alignment done after getting the tie rod ends replaced?

1mrnk6b,Help! AWD Subaru WRX Was Flat Towed For One Mile,"Long story short, my 2023 WRX with AWD & CVT was flat towed for about 1 mile.

I was extremely lucky that a bystander took a picture of them towing it with no dolly and sent it to me, literally dragging it across the city.

I was also very lucky that my friend who is a mechanic was with me at that moment, and he immediately pointed out that this could seriously damage my car, which I wouldn't have known.

The tow place denied it, even after I showed pictures. I called the cops and will file a complaint with the city. I'm not sure if there's any other immediate actions I should take (please educate me if so).

However, I am extremely worried that they could have caused some serious long-term damage that won't reveal itself until later in the cars lifespan. It only has 30k miles on it, and I plan to own it for a long time. 

How likely is it that this has caused serious damage to the car? If likely, then what kind of damage? Is there a specific test/diagnostic that can be done to find out? Lastly, are there any signs/telltales which I should look for while driving that would indicate serious damage (noises, squeaks, rattles..)?

The reason you are having all these codes is poor maintenance. Sorry to say… So, not changing your oil regularly, using poor or wrong grade oil of letting car tun on low oil clogs the oil passages inside engine and causes the timing chain to loosen( timing chain tension tensioner is driven by oil pressure) Poor oil pressure = poor timing chain pressure or no pressure, therefore loose chain and loose chain = rattle.

If you are following me still, loose chain causes engine timing to fall out-of-sync, camshaft and crankshaft can no longer time correctly triggering cam sensor implausibility = check engine light, rough idle, and poor or no cam advancer performance

This in turn causes retarded or advanced ignition timing = knock sensors are triggered (check engine light and EPC on)

So… all the above is caused by low oil, oil starvation, or jus plain negligence. End result is poor engine performance or as your paper reads: poor torque!

If the engine can still be saved, i cannot tell … but if the engine still runs there is a chance that you can flush the engine with a lighter detergent oil, run it for an x amount of minutes, drain and repeat( in an effort to clean out oil passages from accumulated sludge) that is s 50/50 chance.

1mrgy63,When should I get an oil change? Is Honda’s oil life percentage accurate?,"I purchased a used 2018 Honda CR-V, auto transmission and I believe it’s the 2.4L version (I can double check that if advice for the 1.5L is different). Unfortunately the car did not come with an oil change sticker, so I’m trying to figure out when I should get the first oil change done on the car. 

The carfax for the car says that the last oil change happened around 124,500 miles in March. I bought the car from the dealership at 126,000 miles in April, and I’ve put enough miles on it so it’s at around 129,500 miles. 

So in summary, I’ve driven the car enough to put just under 5,000 miles post carfax oil change, and approximately 3.5k miles post getting it from the dealership. So I believe that I should get an oil change sometime soon, however the Honda oil life percentage is at like 70%, and everything I have heard says I should change it once it gets to like 15-20%. So can I trust the oil health %, or should I go with the carfax? If it’s unsure either way then I will probably play it safe and get an oil change soon.

Helping my dad pick a replacement car for Uber in London. He’s run an S350d up to 240,000 miles with no major issues other than normal wear and tear — absolute tank of a car.

Problem is, Uber’s London rules now mean the next car has to be zero-emission capable (hybrid or EV). We’d honestly prefer to stay ICE, but that’s no longer an option.

Budget is fairly tight and the Mercedes C300de (plug-in diesel hybrid) seems like the only thing that ticks the boxes — diesel for long runs, electric for city driving.

Question is:
	•	Has anyone run a C300de past 150k–200k miles?
	•	How reliable are the hybrid parts (battery, charger, inverter)?
	•	Any common headaches with the diesel side (AdBlue, DPF, EGR) in mostly city use with some motorway?

Basically: can we expect the same kind of longevity his S-Class managed, or is this asking too much from a plug-in hybrid?

The ad blue system can also block, but again this is a diesel thing, not just the Mercedes. Can be a pain to sort. 

The gearbox has additional strain switching to electric and back to diesel. Make sure the gearbox has been serviced and maintain it well.

The air suspension is known to develop leaks on high mileage cars. Something to look out for if you get one with this option.

I've now received three £100 parking charges. I did everything requested so appealed to smartparking with proof of membership and attendance on those dates.

They accepted that I'd complied but we're still upholding the charges.

I've asked the land owner for advice and he said he'd sort it. I had a letter from a debt collection agency this last week demanding £170 per charge 
.
I tried to appeal to popla but their system doesn't recognise the charge.

I phoned the debt collection agency and the guy was really nasty and said if I didn't pay in full I'd be taken to the supreme court ??

I've collected all my evidence in case this happens but keep reading stuff like they always win.

Others have had the same issue and the manager has even said when the Internet crashes at the leisure centre it causes the parking system to glitch. Some members have been let off by smartparking and some haven't.

Any advice would be much appreciated.",0,1755380801.0,3,CartalkUK,1755459265,2025-08-16 21:46:41,2025-08-17 19:34:25,"Helpful-Coat-5705 (Score: 3): Sign up to moneysavingexpert forum and post there. Way more useful at this stage

1ms8jul,Insurance doubled after SP30 Speeding Conviction,"Hi all,

First time poster on this sub. I have recently received a conviction for doing 24 in a 20. (Both very pissed off, and bang to rights...) 

I have informed my current insurers, and they have not changed my premium for this year, however looking ahead to renewal, I went on compare the market, where the 'best' non- black box quote was £960 without windscreen cover and a £450 excess. The first sensible quote was £1123.85 with £350 excess.

I have 2 additional drivers, one with 30 years+ no claims and another a serving police officer, both of which are bringing down the price to that. It is more expensive on my own.

I currently pay just over £500 for the year, with 3 years on my licence and 3 years no claims, but am not holding my breath for sensible renewal price with my current provider. This is for a 2015 1.5 dci 4x4 Dacia Duster (Rule 10 of the sub, I agree it is a tractor, but it is also an excellent tow car! 35mpg while towing 1500kg in stop-start traffic in central London...)

1ms6nzz,Car insurance advice after a collision,"I was searching for advice on here for how to negotiate with insurers, but came across this thread and now have more questions: https://www.reddit.com/r/CarTalkUK/s/u5PLQDAvuQ

First and why I was here originally, does anyone have any advice on negotiating a settlement? I feel we've been low balled and I can't find a replacement car for the price offered that is as good as the one that got totaled. I have provided screen shots from Autotrader and eBay with the parameters of the old car, but they've refused to budge on their valuation so far. We are probably about £700 away from being able to replace the vehicle with another of the same spec. 

Second, from the other thread, I'm wondering if my insurance premium is going to go up. For context, we were travelling in Europe on our way to our holiday rental, my partner was driving (named driver), when were smashed into whilst mozying along with traffic in the middle lane by a white van man who was trying to undertake in a tunnel and completely rear ended us. The car got spun around and we then had oncoming traffic avoiding us and our two young kids before some trucks stopped traffic. The whole thing was pretty scary and I have mostly been focusing on being happy that we all got out safely. After reading the other thread though, I'm wondering if my premium will go up despite not even driving the vehicle and my partner being at no fault?   

Other notes that are worth mentioning, this is the first claim I've made in nearly a quarter of a century of driving and we didn't pay extra for legal cover.

Was hit by a motorbike coming the other way who had lost his balance in the wet on a blind corner and crossed onto the oncoming lane. In some ways he was astonishingly lucky as I was in the right place at the right time at the right speed that he went down the side of the car and somehow managed to walk away from it. A second or two either way and he’d either be in the front of my car, the front of the car behind, or wrapped around a tree up the verge like a pretzel. Sum total of my damage was an offside wing mirror, drivers door glass from where his helmet hit and a scrape down the two O/S doors and rear quarter where the handlebar tracked. Anyway, point is, it was a genuine accident, he’d just lost it and neither of us were pushing it; I was doing about 30 approaching the corner, 5 up with all the family. I’m just absolutely thankful everyone was alright.

Called the constabulary and the biker (who, bless him, was on L-Plates, clearly shaken up and extremely apologetic) admitted the fault was his and the police report was available the next day. Called it through to the insurers and then the fun and games began. 

First it was an immediate write-off because the car’s more than 10 years old. Expressing my distaste at that as I’d only just bought the car in May, 2 months prior to the incident, I requested a second opinion on the economic viability of the repair. An engineer came out, checked it over, “Yeah, that’s not so bad really”, and gave it the thumbs-up that it was repairable. So the car then gets picked up, taken off to ‘an approved repairer’ and I hear nothing for a week or so. Until, by text message, by insurer tells me “Following an assessment, the damage to your car is beyond economic repair…please call with you bank details and V5 document and we will release the payment.” Worth noting here that the ‘offer’ was about £5000 less than what I paid for it, but the message itself was fairly blindsiding when I was under the assumption that the car was just being repaired.

Currently back-and-forthing with the Total Loss Department on the valuation, trying to bump it up to any number that is even just a few quid more than the proposed repair costs (a dazzling £12k, including: two new doors, new wheel, new tyre, new sill covers), my main point of argument being: I’ve just bought the car, here’s an invoice to prove it, here’s similar specs on AutoTrader and Car & Classic ALL costing more and/or with higher mileage; either the car needs to be fixed or I need a payout of invoice price, less three months depreciation, else I’m not indemnified as the not-at-fault party.

The saga is ongoing, with me now having to call up the manufacturer to try and get the exact build spec of the car from 2012 with what options were specified at purchase, all just so the insurers can stick another 2p on my write-off value, no doubt. So I’m interested to see how your case goes OP and whether you have any more luck. Incidentally they’ve not yet come back with any revised valuations as of writing this, but they are going back to the ‘approved repair technicians’ (who are clearly all eating from the same trough) and seeing whether they can sharpen their pencil a wee bit.

1ms6b2c,Help me decide on a car,"Hi, standard plea for help deciding on which car to buy…

It’s been a long time since I bought a car and I’m waaaay out of the loop on modern ones.

And to make things worse, I’ve got a shortlist which isn’t very short. Mainly because I’m stuck trying to find the perfect Venn diagram of practicality, luxury, cost and longevity – which we know doesn’t really exist.

Up to £25k (with small flex) – don’t want finance

Up to 3/4 years old (aiming to keep this for maybe 10 years+)

Up to 25k miles (see above)

Open to hybrid but can’t do full electric due to no off-street parking

I currently have a Ford Focus and with no kids or dogs etc – it serves my purposes well. But the time has come for a change. But the offerings for hatchbacks are limited now and I utterly will not get dragged down the path of an SUV or cross over.

I’ve considered a lot of cars but as I’m a confused soul, I keep arguing against myself at all turns.

I live in and around a city so a massive car isn’t a bonus. But I would quite like something a little larger and more luxurious for the comfort aspect. That said, I don’t do motorway miles that often (Ten or so 2-hour motorway trips a year) and my commute is about 20 minutes (but in a nicer car I aim to be doing some road trips around the UK).

My cars slip into 3 brackets – which may overlap in places.

Go for similar to what I have already: Golf, Skoda Scala, Seat/Cupra Leon

Go for larger than I have already: Octavia, Passat - both body shapes

Go for a touch more luxury: VW Arteon, Audi A5

If I go for the nicer end (VW Arteon, Audi A5 etc) – upkeep costs need to be considered. Are they going to be a money pit in a few years?

I aim to keep this one for a long time, so this needs to be taken into consideration.

Whilst the Corolla (both hatch and estate) are undoubtedly solid cars – I’m struggling to want something which 70% of the taxi drivers round here use.

As I say, I have zero need really for an estate car aside from the 3 times a year I go to B&Q and can’t bring something back in my Focus. Though I do quite like the looks of the sporty ones.
In fact that would be a stipulation whichever option I go for, much prefer the sportier nicer looking models.

I’ve wanted something a little more luxurious than my 10 year old focus but will that luxury come back to bite me when things start to go wrong with it?

Help me please. Is it daft to get a bigger car when it’s just me? Is there a lemon out there in my options I need to avoid? Or is there something else I’ve overlooked?",4,1755375112.0,13,CartalkUK,1755459265,2025-08-16 20:11:52,2025-08-17 19:34:25,"Impossible-Contact68 (Score: 3): Modern cars are better and more reliable.

Saloons will be comfortable on the few motorway journeys you do over a year. Do consider the additional vehicle tax you need to shell out for cars that are less than 5 years old but were priced more than £40k when new.

1ms5vao,Astra Head Gasket rant,"Hi all,

I am seeking advice as I find myself in a bit of a pickle. I have owned a petrol Vauxhall Astra 2013 (automatic) since May 2024. It had 63k mileage with 2 previous owners and all MOTs done at Vauxhall. I bought it from a friend at the time and although I am very car illiterate, I unfortunately  did not have it checked for any major issues and bought it for £5000.

It all started to unfold in May 2025 (2 months post my first MOT, at 67k miles) when I got a ""low coolant level"" error on my dashboard. I checked the coolant and it was all creamy sludge. After a quick google search, I understood this was a serious issue. I went to a local garage that was recommended to me and they said this is likely a blown head gasket. 3 weeks and £1400 later, I received the car with a new head gasket and they also changed some internal engine parts. 

Shit hit the fan yesterday (exactly 10 weeks after the repair, 3 of which I was abroad) when I got the same dashboard again. I open the bonnet and there it is, creamy sludge again. I haven't been able to sleep right fearing paying another £1500 on repairs. My question is, is it likely that they did not repair it as they should have? Or is it just my luck?

Most of the production run of Sciroccos has the EA111 1.4TSi which has a badly designed chain drive that has a chain lifetime often less than that of a cam belt, but harder and more expensive to change. The higher power ones also have issues with their superchargers  

Only the last 2 years of production have the hugely superior EA211 engine which fixes all the known issues of the EA111, reverting to belt drive and with a better forced induction system.   

Check the displacement on the V5:

EA111 is 1390cc (do not buy)  

EA211 is 1395cc (buy)
