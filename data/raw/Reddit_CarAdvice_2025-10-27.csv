1ogyvh2,any recommendations on where to look first for a parasitic draw?,"Still working on trying to figure out why my 2015 Nissan NV2500 van has trouble starting in the morning when it's cold. 

I got a new battery under warranty on Friday. 

It lost around 25% charge overnight last night. So I'm pretty sure there is parasitic draw and as a result the cold cranking amps are simply not high enough because of that in the morning for a clean start.

I tried measuring for a parasitic draw by disconnecting the negative and touching the probes to the negative terminal and the negative cable but it just reads 0.0A/mA so I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong.

I ran several charging and cranking tests with a battery tester and they came back normal. See the attached photos. One set is from last night when the battery was full and the other one is from this morning when it had lost around 25% charge.

I presume this has been going on for a while and that's why the battery I had gotten in May was already pretty shot from five months of parasitic draws overnight. 

I did get a new serpentine belt installed at Nissan three weeks ago. Not sure if it could be related to that. Other than that I have not changed or installed any accessories. The only accessory I have is a dash cam.

Tonight I will disconnect the fully charged battery and see what the state of charge is in the morning.

Any recommendations on where to start looking for a parasitic draw?

The location of the puddle can help narrow down the possible sources.

The drain plug gasket can wear out if it isn't replaced during an oil service. You'll see signs of oil seepage around the bolt. Replace the gasket next oil change (or do an oil change now).

The oil pan is strong but it isn't impervious. It can be punctured by rocks and debris if hit just right. Look around the oil pan for any dents, dimples, cracking, or similar wounds. You might see oil seepage before you see the actual damage. Some people claim success with sealant and similar repair kits, but that is dependent on the type and size of damage. Replacing the pan is the foolproof fix.

The oil pan gasket is an RTV sealant from the factory. Most silicone sealants last 5 to 10 years, so it's most likely a slow drip. Check around the bolts holding the pan. If that's the leak, dropping the pan, cleaning the surfaces, and reapplying new sealant is the only fix.

If there isn't a puddle, pop the hood as the oil is leaking out the engine. Valve covers, timing covers, cylinder heads, and camshafts all have gaskets and seals that can fail. Valve cover is the most common under hood leak, IIRC. Next is checking the PCV valve and hoses, as sometimes those fail and let oil squirt out. Repair is replacing the gasket or sealant, or if PCV related replacing the valve and problematic hoses."

1ogsstm,"2018 F150 3.5 Ecoboost ""Low Oil Pressure"" Fault","TLDR: Low oil pressure light comes on and guage is non-functional at cold start. Light will go away and guage becomes functional after fault codes are cleared. Engine is not overheating at all when travelling long distances. It is probably an electrical issue, but where do I start?

About a week ago while leaving work (about an hour from home), a red ""low oil pressure"" alert came up on my dash while beeping 10 times. The guage was completely nonfunctional. Pulled into a level spot, let the engine rest and checked the oil which was closer to the minimum level but still in tolerance. The oil looked in great condition. As I recently changed the oil and filter about 3 weeks ago. There is a leak that I am aware of on the driver side valve cover and I have plans to change that. My coolant level was below the minimum; unfortunately I had just noticed that whichever technician had topped it off at the last multi-point inspection had just set the cap on the coolant reservoir instead of tightening it down. So, the coolant probably just evaporated.

Anyway, I didn't feel comfortable driving it an hour and a half to the shop. It was after 6pm on a friday, and the nearest place that carries oil was about 45 mins away. Instead, I shelled out $700 for a tow and some peace of mind.. When I drove the truck onto the tow truck, the low oil pressure light went off but the check engine light remained. Dealership said they wouldn't be able to look at my truck for like 3-4 weeks.. which wasn't going to work for me. So, on Wednesday I brought some oil and coolant with me, topped everything off and drove a short distance to the hardware store and grabbed a gear wrench obd scan tool. I didn't notice any overheating in that short commute.

I let the engine idle for about 15-20 mins while I set up the obd software, updated everything, and ran a scan. Again, no overheating but the guage was not working and the low oil pressure signal was still on. A few errors popped up, and I decided just to experiment and cleared them. Suddenly, the guage was working fine again and the low oil pressure light went off. I decided I would drive it an hour in to work and see how it drove.. which it drove fine!

I've been driving it since, but basically everytime I cold start it I have either the check engine light on, or both the check engine light and low oil pressure light on. Once and only once, a yellow wrench light came on and it said ""Drive mode unavailable."" I was unable to change the drive mode or use cruise control for that commute.

Otherwise, the engine seems to be operating fine.. No overheating, ""smooth"" transmission (as smooth as it's ever been I guess, which is far from perfect).

It sounds like some electrical issue, but I just don't know where to start with that.. I'll fix the valve cover oil leak, but after that I think I'm just doing a wild goose chase replacing sensors and stuff. Has anyone had this issue or have any advice for me?",1,1761505135.0,3,MechanicAdvice,1761593663,2025-10-26 18:58:55,2025-10-27 19:34:23,"Quantumkool (Score: 2): Check the fuse.

1ogryax,Do I attempt to drill it out or just buy a new one?,"Hi all. Let me preface this with: I am a mechanic noob. I've spent hundreds of hours on YouTube University to get any decent at working on my truck (brakes, throttlebody work, blend door actuator replacement). So while ""fresh"" isn't quite right, I am nowhere near good and I will ask tons of dumb questions. Sorry up front. 

It's a 2012 F150 3.5l Ecoboost and it has multiple failures for a coolant leak. I had it pressure tested and received a list of issues and part issues to be replaced. When every mechanic in the area wanted $2k to $3k in parts/labor, I decided to tackle the job myself.

Everything was going very well. I got everything moved aside/removed, had the old water pump and thermostat housing pulled and replaced. I was getting ready to torque tighten the last bolt on the thermostat into the water pump, and as you can see, the bolt sheared and broke. Issue #? was not getting new bolts as they were likely compromised to start. New bolts are on the way now for the entire assembly as I won't risk that again. I can clearly see the bolt didn't set in properly when I tightened it but I found out too late. I got lucky that this bolt isn't one that goes into the engine block itself. 

So my question is, do I try to drill this bolt out/extract it? Is the pump now compromised because of proper sealing (there are scratches under the green tape from my attempt at using vise grips to get it out)? Or do I eat the cost and get another new pump ($90 OEM). I'm about $1k into the process between new parts and new tools. I had to buy a lot of what I didn't have, and this includes parts like a new heater hose, new coolant reservoir, new thermostat housing (including thermostat housing assembly and thermostat itself), as well as decided to get new belts into the truck. I'm still saving $1k to $2k, so $90 isn't the worst thing ever, but I wanted to know what I'm dealing with here.

1ogoh2t,2020 Grand Cherokee NEED I SAY MORE?,"Alright so Im gonna sum it up as fast as possible. From one day to another my 2020 Grand Cherokee Laredo took a shit, and thats that it has been taken care of extremely well. So it started shaking abruptly at start, and blowing white smoke ( I know I know). Check engine light turns on. I run it thru my diag, Cylinder 3 misfire bullshit. I take it to this mechanic (looked at reviews n shit of his business, seemed really solid). I show up- he shows me the coolant has kinda sprayed and leaked. Replace the thermostat and water pump. Leave. A day or two later. Same shit happens. I take it back. Oh it can possibly be a bad fuel injector. Fk it, changed that shit too & the ignition coil because it was just ""one bad one"". Still didnt fix shit only for them to finally tell me- its the head gasket. I said fk all. Left. 

Let me tell you, I've been to the dealer, 5 mechanic shops, and I mean NO ONE did the steps to even IDENTIFY there was a gasket problem. One mechanic shop said, im not even gonna touch your engine, these engines are dogshit. Replace the whole fkn thing LMAO. 

At this point, im cross referencing shit online that im reading about this apparant known engine problem with these jeeps. Quotes have ranged from 7,000-11,000 grand.

No- no more warranty. Shits gone. So with all this being said. Trade in fkn value is like basically 10-14 grand for this truck when its running. I am contemplating doing that head gasket sealer shit, making sure its koo. Then trading that shit to the dealer (obviously not the one i went to). These assholes had the balls to offer me 4 grand for the truck when its mint inside & out- up until this shit happened. LMAO!!

The way I look at it- 14-16 Gs on a good day for this truck. 7-11 Grand on repairs. Im gonna spend basically half of the value of the truck on a repair. Am I dick for wanting to give this shit back to the exact same people who knew they had shit engines & left us to deal with it?

So here's the issue. My cam sprocket timing is completely off. And I dont mean oh i just need to align the TDC ""dot"" on the cam sprocket to match the TDC dot on the lower sprocket. I mean the TDC dot is in the completely wrong place. It is not where the engine is TDC. It's in a random spot. Why? Cause I took off the sprocket and put it back like an idiot without writing down where the dot was pointed originally. So now the dot is just in some random part of the engine's combustion cycle, with no way to know where it was originally.

So NOW I need to figure out how to ""time"" it correctly and put the dot on where the valves are exactly at TDC. But how? Yea I could ""eyeball"" it with thr valve cover off and when the valves are both relaxed I guess consider that TDC but it wont be accurate

At least take it to a speedy or something to get a proper diagnostic and ideally do the repair right away.

So use one small enough that won't cause that to happen, but not so small that you break the easy out. My go-to option is always to weld a nut to whats left.

The engine used to start with no issues at all, however recently it became less reliable. Engine wouldn’t start unless I added some fuel by pumping the accelerator a couple times when turning the ignition.

Now this method of pumping fuel no longer works and thus the car does not start. 

The battery is all good and I can hear the starter motor turning when trying to start it. 

This has lead me to believe that it’s a fuel pump problem, because of the fact it wouldn’t start unless fuel was added by gas peddle.

# Timeline of Issues

* **Oct 10:** Bought the car from a Kia dealership that also owns an Audi dealership in NJ (used, 38k miles). It came with a dealer-backed limited warranty.
* **Oct 13:** First warning: “Add 1 qt oil.” Topped it off, but surprised to see that so soon.
* **Oct 17:** Another “Add Oil” warning. I held off, worried it might be a sensor issue. No dipstick in this vehicle to manually read the oil level.
* **Oct 19:** “Add Oil Immediately.” I bought and added more oil. Just MMI reading.
* **Oct 20:** Car breaks down on the way to service. Goes into limp mode. Warning for “engine coolant too hot.” Pulled over. After restarting, car shuddered  but I made it to the dealer.
* **Dealer says:** They “forgot to reset the computer” and didn’t top off the oil before selling. Claimed false oil readings.
* **Oct 22–23:** Car stutters again, throws a start/stop malfunction warning and a check engine light. **Oil level dropped halfway in 4 days. No puddles under car. No visible smoke.**
* **Oct 24:** Dealer says it’s “a thermostat issue” and that the car was sold “as-is” (which contradicts the signed warranty docs).
* **Oct 25:** I send them the warranty documents, they acknowledge there's a 60 day warranty now, but the thermostat is not covered.

A few questions:

* Could a bad thermostat alone cause this kind of rapid oil loss?
* If not, what else should I ask the mechanic to check?
* Is it more likely to be piston rings, PCV valve, turbo seals, or something else?
* How is this car burning so much oil with no smoke and no external leaks?",2,1761478160.0,2,MechanicAdvice,1761593663,2025-10-26 11:29:20,2025-10-27 19:34:23,"objective_opinions (Score: 1): I would return the car if possible.

1oghqxx,Issue with brake bleeding,"Hi All,  
  
I've spent some time on my 1991 Lotus Elan SE Turbo (No ABS) fitting new rear callipers and refurbishing the front callipers, alongside replacing some brake lines. This morning though, I went to bleed the brakes using the two-person method, but it doesn't seem to be working.  
  
When we did the traditional two-man brake bleed, initially the pedal straight away pushed to the floor before releasing any bleeder valves, and in turn the fluid level in the MC lowered - I assume this is just the lines filling up with fluid. However, after pressing the pedal 5 or so times, the fluid stopped lowering in the MC and stayed the same, but the pedal kept going to the floor. I then did the classic release the bleeder valve while the pedal was down, and repeated a few times, but fluid never came out. Would this be a result of the pedal already being on the floor before cracking the valve, and therefore, there's no more pressure to push fluid out once the valve is cracked?  
  
Before I started the process, the MC was dry, and little fluid had come out when I had removed brake lines previously; however, I never pressed the brake pedal while the MC was dry, so would the MC still need bleeding?  
  
Not sure where to go from here... Would a vacuum/pressure bleeder help by just sucking the fluid and air out?

It went out on me this week, so I went to replace it, and it turns out one of the pins in my caliper was stuck and one of the brake pads actually fell out of place and got lodged between the rotor and caliper. Luckily, someone else had spare parts for the exact same car on hand, so we switched out the calipers and put new brakes on that side so I could get home.

1oggfzw,Major Renault safety concern investigated by The Sunday Times,"Back in May, on the M4 slip-road in Berkshire (England) my Renault Megane decided to make its own emergency stop due to a minor error: full braking in live, motorway, traffic, no driver input and NOT collision avoidance AEB.

Renault called it “normal behaviour”, told me the car had acted correctly and refused to accept that I had any cause for complaint. They refused to accept the car is fundamentally unsafe and refused to guarantee that it wouldn't happen again.

This left me paying £500 finance a month for a car that isn't safe to use (illegal to knowingly drive an unsafe car) and given me well over £1,000 of hire and extra insurance costs (friend has let me use their car from time-to-time).

The Sunday Times have now investigated the case and what it says about Renault’s hybrid safety systems.

1og6tay,How does one do a win toe adjustment alignment,"At my last job, we had an in-ground Hunter alignment rack where I would align the front and rear toe on Hondas. I’d drive the car onto the rack as centered as possible so the sensors could read properly, and if it wasn’t centered, I’d readjust. Once it was in position, I’d put the car in neutral, turn it off, and chock the left rear wheel. Then I’d enter the vehicle information on the screen, raise the lift to chest level, and install the four sensors on the wheels.

After that, I’d center the turnplates under the tires, perform the rolling compensation until it showed green. I’d chock the rear wheels, install the brake pedal depressor, turn the steering wheel left and right as instructed on the screen, then straighten it and secure it with the steering wheel lock. Once that was done, I’d raise the car to a comfortable height to adjust the rear and front toe until both were in the green. Finally, I’d print the results, test-drive the car, and park it

At my new job, the Hunter alignment rack is a bit different. Here, they remove the rear pins on the ramps, don’t use a steering wheel holder, and jounce the car up and down while adjusting the toe.

I presume the crankshaft is immobile since you mentioned the crank pulley not moving, which is attached to the crankshaft. This suggests that your engine may be seized due to a serious mechanical problem necessitating an engine replacement, or it could be hydro-locked, with fuel flooding the cylinders because of a faulty engine computer keeping the injectors active. If this is the case, you must remove all spark plugs and manually turn the engine to expel excess fuel. Take caution as this will release raw gasoline, posing a fire hazard.

Car: 2008 Citroen C4 Picasso Exclusive

Engine: 1.6 HDi (Engine Code: 9HZ)

Problem: ECU Not Receiving Correct Voltage from BSM (Engine Shutoff Solenoid Circuit)

Hello everyone,
I'm working on my 2008 C4 Picasso 1.6 HDi (9HZ) which has developed a stubborn starting/shut-off fault. The AA confirmed a diagnostic that the ECU is not receiving the correct voltage from the BSM (Boîtier de Servitude Moteur), leading to a suspected malfunction in the engine shutoff solenoid circuit.

My next step is to physically inspect the BSM for corrosion or a faulty component, but I'm running into the common Citroën issue of inaccessible relays.

My Key Question:
On the BSM unit for the 9HZ engine, which manages the ECU power:
1. Which relay (R1, R2, etc.) inside the BSM is the main Engine ECU Power/Injection Relay (the one controlling the power feed to the ECU/Solenoid)?

2. Is this a replaceable plug-in relay, or is it one of the common soldered-in relays (often a large black cube) that require desoldering?

Any member who has a wiring diagram or has successfully opened and repaired a BSM from this specific DV6 engine model (9HZ) would be a massive help. I need to identify the exact relay terminals to test before I consider a full BSM replacement.

1ogt9qp,Alternator/Battery Question,"My 2015 Nissan Rogue ""died"" in a parking lot last night. The only sign there was any semblance of power was the red security key light blinking on my dash. Geico Emergency Roadside Services came and jump started with a handheld jump pack. I drove 70 miles home, but as soon as I parked at my house and turned the car off, it ""died"" again. ie: lights normally stay on for a minute, but they went immediately off, dash went immediately dead, etc. Browsing the internet seems to suggest it's either an alternator or battery issue. I currently live in a fairly rural area, but there is an Autozone 25 miles away (that's also about as close as the nearest mechanic), and a Tru Value 3 miles away. The Tru Value has a plug-in battery charger for sale. I'm thinking of walking to the Tru Value, buying the battery charger, and charging my battery overnight, then driving to Autozone to get the battery/alternator tested.

That said, as I'm researching this on the internet, there are some suggestions this is a terrible idea under the assumption it's the alternator, and driving with a bad alternator is a bad idea, since the car will eventually stall, though people seem to typically say it should happen fairly quickly. On the other hand, I drove 70 miles last night after the jump start, which some places on the internet seem to suggest means it isn't the alternator and it's the battery. And, if it is indeed the battery, charging it may not work, and my 70 mile drive might have been powered by my alternator last night, and if that didn't charge the bad battery, my buying a portable battery charger isn't going to do anything.

Thoughts?

  
Edit:

Since I posted this, a distant neighbor gave me the number to a local mechanic who works out of their home, and that mechanic agreed to come out to my house and he found the following:

* Battery is fine, with a caveat. 
* Alternator is fine.

He attached his Noco GB70 to my battery terminals, but didn't actually jump start my car, because his Noco errored out. So, he then pulled out his voltmeter and checked the charge, and found it to be 12.6V. He told me to get into my car, I did, and my dash lit up (it didn't do this before, as recently as 10 mintues prior to this; remember, after I parked last night, everything ""died""; car definitely wouldn't start, and I tried this one more time about 10 minutes before he arrived with the same results). He then had me start it, and it started just fine. He tested battery and alternator and found nothing wrong, with my battery registering 14.4V, though he's puzzled why his Noco ""protected itself"" and wouldn't let him use it (he just got it the day before, so he said he's not experienced with it, so didn't want to hazard a guess as to why his Noco didn't like my battery, so the caveat is he doesn't know what about my battery his Noco didn't like).

Then, through his direction, we tested a few things out and found:

* My Nissan Key fob isn't immediately recognized. I have to hold it up to my start button. This is the normal behavior when my key fob battery is low, but I replaced it and it still does it. 
* When I get out, after turning the car off, and close my door, everything ""dies"". Fob can't lock the car, and the lock button on the door handle is also unresponsive. The only thing you can see is the anti-theft red light blinking inside. 

He thinks it's an electrical issue and/or fob issue (I lost my spare, so no easy way to test at the moment). We could not replicate my car just completely ""dying"" like it did last night though, after numerous starts/stops, all of which were successful. He was very clear he has little experience with modern cars with their ""fancy computers"" though. He suggested I call the closest Nissan service center, which I will. He didn't charge me, as he said he didn't do anything, and he's never heard of something like this, so I've given him a story to tell.

But also, the Noco LEDs kinda suck and are difficult to read. I prefer the simpler ANCEL tester that is like $40 from Walmart. A multimeter is okay, but a 12v battery that can only generate 50ish amps for cranking is a dead battery. The ANCEL and similar testers will give a cold crank amperage reading as well. I'm surprised your visitor didn't bring the battery load tester that looks like a cheese grater.

In my experience, batteries last about one year past their warranty from the manufacturer date, give or take a few months. And your symptoms sound like a battery that doesn't want to charge."

1ogkb7n,Ac blowing warm air,"Hey everyone, so I ran across an interesting repair this week. I have a 2011 Dodge Nitro with a 4L V6 engine ~130k miles with a malfunctioning AC. Turned the temp to cool and max AC. It was warm.. Not ambient temp, but warm. Put the gauges on, and everything was in range. The compressor would cut on and off when I turned the AC on and off. The LP hose was ice cold. I was thinking that the solenoid, or whatever that part is called, was stuck, but I wasn't quite sure where it was located in the 4L model. I decided to try to reset the AC first. Disconnected the battery for 15 min, then connected and started it with the AC completely off for 30 min. I cut it on, and like magic, it was blowing 55-degree air at an 83-degree ambient temperature. 

 I primarily posted this to help someone else. However, I would also like to know if I should consider a new solenoid or if this was just a glitch, as the car is now about 15 years old. Also, from my quick research, it said there can be multiple solenoids. I am going to see if my Haynes book has any info, but I know they usually don't cover stuff related to the AC. Any other resources that can be recommended would be great.

You have an actuator for the temp, recirculation/fresh air inlet, and usually one or two actuators for the defrost and floor modes. By disconnecting the battery the HVAC control module lost its position memory for the actuators and it had to perform a relearn. 

What had likely occured is the HVAC module probably had a over limit or circuit code for the blend door actuator aved in it. At that point it likely disabled the blend motor to prevent damage to the actuator and the module's own internal circuitry. 

The best scenario is that it was just a door stuck or dragging, causing the actuator to log a fault in the controller. If it continues to function, then that likely it. The most likely scenario is the actuator and door are wearing out where they are pinned together or the actuators little gears or motor are getting a bit worn. 

Having a scan tool capable of communicating with the HVAC module would help shed some light on this, but the reset you performed was helpful to get an idea what you're likely going to looking at.

Google videos on temp blend door actuator replacement on the Nitro and KK Liberty, that should let you know if the dash has to come out to repair it.

About a month ago, I started having problems with my thermostat. My engine read as overheating, but its not actually hot itself. I have no signs of overheating. My heat, AC and radiator fan all work. Ny radiator runs loud after driving recently.

One day, my engine light flicked off qnd my thermostat went from the top of hot to below cold. It bounces between the minimum and maximum temperature when the engine light is on. Im almost certain this censor is gone.

Two weeks ago, (monday) I tried to start my car and.... nothing. It would crank and crank and crank. We went back a few hours and she started. It was a rough start, but it ran.

I drove it multiple times. Then Friday, I tried to start it (after driving it to school) and nothing. Went back a few hours, nothing. We changed the spark plugs in the parking lot (because we thought it was that) and.... nothing. To get the car to start, we had to hit the alternator while cranking it. It stalled out a few times. We got it home.

So i got a new alternator, thinking it was that. My belt was tightened (probably needs to be replaced; thats my next step). It was perfect. For a day. I had it back for one day. Someone hit the front (fender) of my car (and took off) and now I'm having trouble. These two things are probably not connected. Thought id mention it.

When shes going ti eventually start, she cranks, shakes and makes that sound in the video. Then she starts, and if I go to rev it, stalls out. I got it started and drove to work. Once it was finally started, my engine light was off. Yay? I know i shouldn't have drove it.

This week, I went to a local mechanic to have them put on my car (2018 Nissan Rogue SL). Mechanic immediately noticed there were no hub centric rings, and advised it was a bad idea to drive around without them.

I called the Tire dealer - they said that hub centric rings should have been provided already but I can come in for a new set free of charge.

Local mechanic agrees to mount without the hub centric rings till we can pick up the parts. There were no lug nuts for the new wheels and they couldn’t mount at all with the lug nuts that came standard from the factory. Mechanic didn’t charge for service.

At this stage we put the old tires back on, drive incredibly slowly down icy roads to get to the Tire dealer. They get the tires on, but say that we don’t need hub centric rings at all because Kalon tires aren’t designed to work with them. According to the tire dealer, there’s not a ‘slot’ for them to fit into. Also, the hub caps don’t fit and had to be left off. Not sure if that’s relevant but thought I’d mention it.

I noticed some vibration while driving on the new tires, and have read that can be caused by improper installation without the rings for wheels that need them.

The back and forth with the tire dealer is making me suspicious - is it true that Kalon wheels don’t need hub centric rings? I know there can be ‘lug centric’ designs, but want to verify if this is true for my wheels. I’ve tried looking for manufacturer information, but haven’t found an answer.

Thanks in advance for your help!",1,1761456170.0,2,mechanic,1761593663,2025-10-26 05:22:50,2025-10-27 19:34:23,"justdaisukeyo (Score: 2): According to this, Kalon Pyro wheels have a 73mm hub bore.

You need centering rings.

You also need lug nuts that are compatible with your Kalon Pyro wheels."

What is my recourse?","Hey all. I have a 2019 Malibu with almost 100k miles. A month ago, I noticed white smoke coming from the exhaust and immediately brought it into a local shop. They quoted me a $2400 repair to replace the PCV valve, cover, and valve tubing. For context, I owe $13k on this car, its probably worth less than $5k. I bought it at the absolute worst time to buy a car, when I absolutely needed a car, with bad credit. Anyways. They warned me before doing this repair that there COULD be a more expensive fix required/need a new engine, but wouldnt be able to know for sure until doing this repair. Because of the situation with how much I still owe on the car, I was extremely hesitant to go ahead with the repair and put more money into what could be a car that isn't worth it. I ended up telling them to go ahead with the fix. I picked it up a few days later, they said everything was fine and the more expensive repair was not necessary. No more white smoke, car is seemingly running fine. Have been driving on the highway ~15 mins one way to and from work for the last 3 weeks. 

Last night on the way home from work, 3 minutes from home, a message on the dash pops up saying ""AC turned off due to high engine temperature."" I look at the temperature gage and sure enough, its all the way maxed out. I immediately pull over and pop the hood. First time popping the hood since before bringing it in for the repair. I don't know a lot about cars, but I know what the coolant reservoir is, and it was empty. Then, I look down and there is an open white tube that looks like it should have a cap on it, that does not. It's just open. I ask my roommate to take a look, and he said thats where the coolant cap is supposed to be. 

So... it would seem I've been driving for three plus weeks daily on the highway just evaporating coolant. I am worried about long term damage that may have been done to the engine, on a car that could be on its last legs. Not to mention that isn't even worth what any future repairs would be due to damage done here. 

The shop seems to be more of a tire shop. They did tell me that if it ended up needing the bigger fix, that wouldn't even be something that they would be able to do.

About 8 months ago I hit a patch of black ice while making a turn going maybe 5mph, I slid into a curb with my front right wheel, I know have a few noticeable issues that weren’t apparent right away, the big one is the 1.1 degree difference in caster, this also might be the cause of the other issue. 

The caster on my front wheels have a huge difference, not just a little bit to adjust for road crown, the other interesting part is that the side I hit the curb on which is the front right, is also the one that is in spec according to my alignment paper. I also think that my caster is affecting something else, when I’m driving and I reach around 30-40 mph and anything faster than that my wheel starts to vibrate, but not the normal poor balanced vibration. The best feeling to describe it is that one wheel has really bad toe and it’s being dragged back into place every couple of rotations. Or like musical rumble strips with even spacing in between. It’s not vibrating the whole car, but I can definitely feel it in my steering wheel and pedals.

Important things to note and what I’m looking for.
1. What is most likely broken or bent from hitting the curb
   I have replaced my struts since the hit so they are not bent. And my wheels have also been changed. 
2. I have a custom top hat to my front struts that allows me to adjust both camber AND caster.

Usually when it’s bad you see larger chunks sticking out of it. A leak down test is often better for causing carbon valve issues. Or a transducer which catches the valve not sealing at random.

It could be causing the issue but in my opinion unless you have leak down I’d look elsewhere.

I’m looking to buy my first car and could really use some advice — I’m quite confused at this point.

Budget: around £6k, can stretch to £6.5k for something decent.

Cars I’m currently considering:

Honda Jazz or Civic
Toyota Yaris
Hyundai i10 / i20 / i30
Volkswagen (not sure yet)
Mazda? 

A few questions:

1. I’ve read on here that I should avoid Ford PowerShift, dry DSG, and anything with a Multidrive gearbox — is that right? Are there any Ford models that are still worth considering?

2. I’ve seen a few 2024–2025 Toyota Vitz/Yaris imported ones — are those good options or better to avoid?

3. I’m based in the South (Winchester / Southampton / Portsmouth / Isle of Wight).
There aren’t tons of listings on AutoTrader near me, but I found some decent ones around 80 miles away.
Would you consider buying from that far, or is it safer to stick closer to home in case anything goes wrong with the dealer?

4. Is it worth looking at 2014 models or cars with a bit over 100k miles?

i need a car and only drive automatic, but can’t save £10k for a nice hatchback atm, so i’ve been thinking about financing a Mazda2 Hybrid 75 plate.

i haven’t seen many people talk abt the Mazda2 Hybrid version, only seen good reviews about the non-hybrid version. so i wanted to ask, what do people on this thread think of the car? is it actually reliable? ik it’s basically a Yaris. and, is it expensive to get new parts etc if something goes wrong?

Probably worth joining an owners club as sometimes can get discounts on classic policies and just general help.

Also note that this is a cool first car. Parts are plentiful and they're easy to work on. But she shouldn't expect trouble free motoring. There's quite a lot to keep on top of on an old car. Servicing intervals are shorter and she'll probably need to use premium fuel because of the lower ethanol. 

Also she's giving up a lot of safety compared to a more modern car. No crumple zones, no collapsing steering column, no airbags, no ABS, no traction control etc. Modern cars are huge by comparison (it's dwarfed even compared to the Nissan it's next too) so you will end up worse off in any collision. I'd probably avoid being a passenger until she's mastered it. 

Things like merging will take a lot more skill too. The size will make it easy to park, but no offside mirror will add to the challenge. For first gear there is no synchromesh so she'll need to learn to double de-clutch. She'll be a good driver if she makes it mind.

Keep daily comfort + reliability

Maintain self-levelling rear air suspension

Upgrade brakes, cooling, and handling to M-car level

If you want more you’re into bigger/hybrid turbo and fuelling upgrades and that’s where it’ll get expensive. After a hybrid turbo, the next “stage” is something along the lines of m50d fuel pump & rail sensor and then b57 injectors. There’s an “n57 tuning” Facebook group/chat with some very knowledgeable folk in that might be worth a visit.

Decent coil overs on the front with matching shocks on the rear I’d imagine would go a long way.

Brakes can actually be a surprisingly expensive area, fronts you have options, rear is hard because of the hand brake - without getting very involved the only sensible rear upgrade is 550d rear brakes I think. Fronts you have options but even the cheapest option, using g30 374mm callipers with 550 discs is gona be around 800-1000 for just callipers, but that might not be enough of an upgrade for what you want.

As always with cars, it’s all cost/benefit. I’m doing a few bits to mine but only stuff that doesn’t cost the earth and compromise reliability (or improves it), deletes/IC/remap are almost a no brainer as it almost just puts the car where it should have left the factory. Cosmetic is purely subjective, I don’t think an f10 M5 bumper bolts on, it doesn’t like up I don’t think, I think you have to do wings as well but don’t quote me on it, if you have to get them painted it’s gona get spendy.

Oh also, google “darkside m4d project” and go and watch that series and you’ll get an idea what it takes to turn a 35d into an m4 killer. They bought a 435 that already had the cosmetic mods done."

I'm looking for any advice anyone has for a good option for a runaround for under £2500.

I commute 14 miles (there and back) to work 3x days a week which is generally town driving with a fair bit of traffic. Then also would be using it as a little run around with not too much driving too often right now.

I have a campervan which is my daily driver right now as I sold my previous car to fund this build around 12 months ago and I've started a new job 2 months ago where driving the campervan isn't the most ideal or fuel sensible option right now. Therefore just looking for a reliable, cheap runaround so I don't have to keep driving the van everywhere all the time whilst I'm also trying to finish the interior buildout.

I've done a bit of research in this sub and seen that a few people recommend Honda's or Mazda's so have been looking at Civic's and Mazda 2's.

Something with 12 months' MOT, and an MOT history which suggests it was looked after (i.e. the same advisories don't keep appearing year after year).

I'd also recommend looking for ""unfashionable"" cars, since they can be a bit cheaper. For example Suzuki is a very reliable brand, and everybody loves their Swifts and Jimnys. As a result, those two models can end up costing a bit more. By contrast, their Altos, Celerios, and Balenos are just as reliable but not as wanted.

One I might suggest is the mk7 Honda Civic [like this one](https://www.autotrader.co.uk/car-details/202510147134491). The newer ""spaceship"" mk8 has a great rep, so the older one gets overlooked. But it's fairly bulletproof and practical, and because of their age even the very best examples aren't too expensive. The higher spec ones even get a sunroof and heated leather seats. Just make sure the MOT history doesn't mention corrosion. [High Peak Autos did a video on one a couple of years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lEVmWUXoME).

The other ones I'd suggest to look at are pre-2012 Kia Ceeds and Hyundai i30s. They were the first cars those brands produced after the company decided to improve the quality/dynamics of their cars. They're a bit utilitarian, but cheap, reliable, and are usually good on insurance too.

> Feedback on dealer service was mixed. While some readers praised the prompt and courteous service from MG dealerships, others experienced delays in sourcing parts, which extended repair times. One owner mentioned that their car was off the road for an extended period due to a lack of available components. There were also comments about the cost of repairs being higher than expected for certain fixes, such as electrical work.

They note that when new it was sold with a large collection of cables, so if you're buying second hand you should make sure they're all still present and correct.

The fact that it's an unfashionable estate rather than an SUV (or even one of MG's more recent, sleek-looking EVs) seems to have given it a pummelling on the second hand market, but as you say, prices are tempting as a result. I'm seeing one-owner 21-plate cars with a FSH and a 200 mile range for less than £7000 on Auto Trader.

1ogju9c,Cars you can put things in (fast estates),"Right CarTalkUK team

The budget is £10-12k and the must haves are cool, spritely, and able to be stacked high. 

Previous cars include: C63 estate, 2x E91 335i, Lexus is300 sportcross.

- Jaguar XF V6 Sportbrake (diesel :( ) 

- Audi S4 avants (never felt like interior wise these held up to the merc/bmw, but maybe I should go and check one out. Also reliability issues?) 

- Japanese Volvo V60 import - a bit of an unknown quantity for me, but as they’re understated could be fun to chav it up to keep things interesting

- S class - yeah realistically this is dumb but I’ve never had one and they’re cultural titans of the automotive world

1oghpnb,"Bought a Toyota Yaris 2012 six weeks ago, clutch feels heavily worn - Any advice?","
Hi everyone,

I bought a 2012 Toyota Yaris 1.33 manual from Steven Eagell Toyota Rayleigh about six weeks ago. 

When I bought it, they told me the car came with a 1-year warranty, which I assumed was through Toyota. After the sale, I found out it’s actually an RAC warranty, and apparently clutches aren’t covered.

The problem is, the clutch already feels very worn. The biting point is really faint, and when I drive it, I can barely feel where it engages. My brother drove it too and said I must’ve eaten the clutch up, but that makes no sense- I’ve barely used the car.

Since buying it, I’ve probably done about 15–25 short drives, each about 10–15 minutes locally. No long trips, no heavy use, nothing like that. So it doesn’t add up that the clutch could already be this worn unless it was already on its way out when I bought the car.

I’ve raised a few issues with them before (battery/key stuff) and they’ve been responsive but slow.
I just want to know:

	•	Can I push for them to repair or replace the clutch under consumer rights, since the fault may have been developing before purchase?

	•	Or is there any way to get them to cover the cost as goodwill, since I’ve had it such a short time?

	•	Any advice on what to say or how to word it when I contact the dealer next?

Appreciate any help or examples from anyone who’s dealt with similar situations.

Thanks.

1ogfgdr,Major Renault safety failure - investigated by The Sunday Times,"Back in May, on the M4 slip-road in Berkshire (England) my Renault Megane decided to make its own emergency stop due to a minor error: full braking in live, motorway, traffic, no driver input and NOT collision avoidance AEB.

Renault called it “normal behaviour”, told me the car had acted correctly and refused to accept that I had any cause for complaint. They refused to accept the car is fundamentally unsafe and refused to guarantee that it wouldn't happen again.

This left me paying £500 finance a month for a car that isn't safe to use (illegal to knowingly drive an unsafe car) and given me well over £1,000 of hire and extra insurance costs (friend has let me use their car from time-to-time).

The Sunday Times have now investigated the case and what it says about Renault’s hybrid safety systems. If you own an E-Tech or any modern hybrid, it’s worth five minutes of your time. [https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/driving/article/what-happens-if-your-car-performs-a-sudden-emergency-stop-pxp7hb2m6](https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/driving/article/what-happens-if-your-car-performs-a-sudden-emergency-stop-pxp7hb2m6)

Cars are incredibly complex with multiple teams all working on their own sub systems. Even then it may be further broken down - powertrain split into engines and then transmissions for example (and could be split further into AT/MT).  communication between departments varies but they do address issues. 

I would speculate in this specific instance with your specific issue, Renault are fundamentally correct in saying it’s “normal” for the faulty system to trigger an “emergency stop” or bring the car to a halt quickly because that is what it was programmed to do.

However what’s considered “normal” and what is considered the “correct” response, is a whole different question. 

When it comes to type approval this isn’t straightforward either. Some components are regulated, mirrors, lamps, tyres, the emissions system of a power train - there’s are all subjected to. And certain elements of cars are regulated - corner radii, lamp placement for example. But the whole car isn’t scrutinised for every eventuality and out come. 

Recalls are issued on the basis of likelihood and risk. If this is the first case of this fault then I wouldn’t expect them to do much because the fact and data suggest its not worth following up on, or a later software update will change the programming

Edit to add:- EuroNCAP has a large part to play with a lot of the driver assist and subsequent interventions that aren’t legislativ/mandated. But that’s a whole different conversation.

Going to a dealership will put their overheads on which may push you over budget, you might as well save that money and fix faults yourself. Have a good look around it, look under it for rust, ask to see the full service history and make sure it’s been serviced every year or every 10/15k miles. Look under the bonnet for leaks or something not right. Make sure the timing belt/chain has been changed. Take it on a test drive making sure the car gets warm and take it on a 70 road and listen for noises, take it up a hill and check for power.

Try and do it locally, look on eBay or Facebook marketplace, as if you travel far for a car you tend to ignore issues as you need it to get home again.

If someone is cagey or makes excuses for why somethings not right or why there’s no history, walk away.

Independently i have a manual override for the coolant fan so I can pre-emptively turn it on in heavy traffic to moderate the coolant temperatures. Obviously I never use this if the red light is still on
