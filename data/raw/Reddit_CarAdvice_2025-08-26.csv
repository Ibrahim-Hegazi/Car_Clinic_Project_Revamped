I had to top up coolant by 30 oz or so, last time it was full was 10 months ago, so essentially lost 30 oz in 10 months, not sure if that’s concerning. 

Engine temps are normal, so I think if it is blown head gasket it’s at the very early stage.

That's just a return hose, it's not really under any pressure so it's not critical that you get the exact one from Toyota... I wouldn't buy that from Toyota. 


I don't know the specific diameter of hose, but go to any good auto parts store and they should sell bulk hoses... I know NAPA usually carries bulk hoses by the foot. 


 If you have the old hose, bring it there and they can match it up... otherwise try to measure the approximate size of the hose nipple... you can do this by sticking a sharpened pencil in the end of the nipple, and then marking around the pencil end the approximate diameter that you would need. Make absolutely sure that you get hose that is rated for use with oil/gas. 

SubiePros (Score: 1): Autozone or Oreilly won’t really have this. But truck part supplies usually will. Determine the size of its 5/8, 1/2, 3/4. And determine the length. Sometimes might need longer than the actual hose since oem hose has that little bend. 
Go and ask for oil resistant hose in that size and get new spring clamps.

About a day later the low oil pressure warning came back again and I started hearing a rattling noise. I took it back once more and this time they told me the engine has a bad rod and is basically done. They also found metal shavings in the oil. 

The shop insists it isn’t related to anything they did, but the timing is hard to ignore. The car had just been checked with no issues and all of this started right after their oil service. I don’t know yet what it will cost to replace the engine or what the car might be worth as-is.

I have a 1996 f150 with the 4.9 Inline 6. I purchased it a few months ago after it had been sitting for 7/8 years unused. A few weeks ago, it developed an odd misfire while driving and lost all power. Got it towed home, and started looking about. 

I replaced spark plugs, as they were pretty badly fouled. 
Replaced all filters & did a service

That seemed to do the trick. She was running like a top for about 2 weeks, until last week when I was coming home. Start coming up a hill in my neighborhood, and same thing comes back. No power, awful misfire. Had to coast it back down the hill and wait for a tow. 

Got around to working on it this weekend. I did a new fuel filter again, thinking it’s possible there is still some crud in the tank from when it was sitting, seeing as I don’t drive it much. Cut the filter open, and it was clean. Like, super clean. So bad gas got scratched off the list. 

Started checking plug wires, noticed a few with some decent buildup. Replaced them this afternoon, but to no avail. Now before I start firing the parts cannon into a 385k km truck, I’m wondering if anyone here has some pointers on where to start. 

Current diag :
- idles perfect. 
- starts just fine every time, cold or warm 
- throttle response is great, until half throttle. Half throttle or higher, and the misfire becomes bad enough to stall the engine out. 
- has very low power/acceleration when in gear. 
- 385,000km on the clock. No parts lists came with it, so I have no clue what has even been changed before it was parked, how well taken care of it was, etc.

Hello all,

I’ve got a 2015 X3 xDrive30d with 140,000 km on it. Always kept up with maintenance and servicing.

The issue:
It recently developed a shudder at low speeds once the car is at operating temperature.

I took it to my trusted indy Euro specialist. After going over the car, he suspected the transfer case. (He disconnected it for a test drive and the car shifted and drove perfectly.) He mentioned this isn’t an uncommon issue and recommended an oil change.

We did that, but the problem persisted. So, he replaced the entire transfer case with a second-hand unit (~68k km), reprogrammed everything, and road tested it. The shudder is still there.

After consulting BMW technicians, their advice was that everything we’ve done is correct, but it may take 400–500 km for the new oil to fully circulate and “soak in” the internals. At that point, they say it should settle down. My mechanic is sceptical about that explanation.

My question:
What’s your opinion on BMW’s advice? Can this kind of issue actually resolve itself over time with fresh oil and use, or is that just wishful thinking?

1mzzeqj,Wanting to add an Aux battery to car,"Hello! I had a relatively easy question I think. I'm looking to add an auxiliary battery to my car. Something that can run things like interior and external lighting without draining my car battery. To sum it up best, sometimes at car meets, or just at a family gathering, I'd want my underglow and similar small demanding lights to run separately so I can just vibe and have a good time without wondering if my car will start. Something that will still charge when the car is running but not risk draining my car juice with the car off. And it'd be ideal to have my ignition off and still enjoy a light show. I'd assume I would wire it to my original battery but have a fuse and isolator hooked up. Is there anything I should worry about for this? Is this something I should avoid? I'm mechanically inclined and I'm not going to cobb anything. I want legitimate advice to do this correctly. This would be mounted in my trunk for reference with any necessary insulation and brackets needed to do a professional level install and routing of wires. Also if this is something that would interfere with a new vehicle (2023 Subaru) that would be nice to know!

The tube in your car could also be designed poorly and cause this to happen. Some cars do this and different nozzles can cause this where others will work fine.

1mzzjqx,"Locked out of my VW Golf 5 — flat battery and broken driver’s lock, what’s the best way to get in?","Hey everyone,

I’ve managed to get myself stuck outside of my 2007 VW Golf 5 and could use some advice.

* I accidentally left my lights on, so the battery is completely dead.
* Normally I’d just use the remote, but the car doesn’t respond at all.
* The mechanical lock on the driver’s door is broken — the key just spins and doesn’t engage.
* There aren’t any other key slots on the car (no mechanical locks on the other doors or trunk).

So at the moment, I can’t get inside at all.

From what I understand, this is a common Golf issue where the lock cylinder or connecting rod fails. I’ll need to get the lock repaired later, but right now my immediate problem is simply **getting into the car without damaging anything unnecessarily**.

My question:  
What’s the best/most practical way to get inside the car in this situation?

* Would roadside assistance or a locksmith usually be able to open it without damage, even with the flat battery?
* Or are there tricks specific to the Golf 5 for safely getting in when the lock cylinder has failed?

I’d really prefer to avoid breaking anything if possible, but right now I just need to get the door open.

Some modifications can make a car less reliable. Adding more power to the engine can cause engine, transmission, and drivetrain issues, even if it's accelerated wear and tear. Suspension modifications can cause a car to be less enjoyable in driving, cause faster/irregular tire wear, and poor handling. Audio/electrical modifications can cause battery/alternator issues, even parasitic draw issues. (Not saying it will, but it can cause issues)

Personally, I would audit how you use the car and if there's something that would make it easier to use in that fashion.

1mzes5c,"Are new diesels just really loud, or are all my neighbor's cars modified?","Moved into an apartment nearby a car wash, which thankfully has a lot of sound insulation, but some cars occasionally manage to punch right through it (especially in the low frequencies, sub-100Hz) and I'm mostly just curious what exactly I'm hearing.

Obviously there's definitely a lot of muffler-less cars that make it extremely obvious because they rev their engine while turning onto the street at 10mph. Then there's the handful that don't rev but still sound like they're going 60mph at 5mph, sometimes beater trucks but sometimes newer lifted trucks, I assume that's the same situation (I'd also say they sound very similar to motorcycles if that gives an idea of the sound).

But sometimes I'll just hear a pure 75Hz-85Hz tone and see it's someone basically idling. This is the one I don't understand and it's strangely common, usually from trucks but I've seen it on at least one van as well (Subaru/Jeep/similar).

My partner says it's just that diesel engines are loud and some of them have terrible tuning, and they *are* loud but I grew up around a diesel and they aren't ""resonate my entire room from 80ft away"" loud, especially not newer diesels. And even from a distance they don't really dissolve to pure bass tones I don't think, it always has a bit of an upstroke-downstroke ticking at sub-70Hz frequencies.

Anyhow, what am I hearing, is it a diesel thing, a straight piping thing, a muffler thing, or does everyone have subwoofers blasting at 85Hz?

(Anyhow yes I'm sure I'll get used to it eventually, but understanding the sound would greatly help me to tune it out)

Edir: The best guess I can find with some research, it might be cars without catalytic converters in particular?

Edit 2: My second guess is maybe something like a glasspack resonator, that seems to sound closer to what I sometimes hear.",9,1756088959.0,25,CarTalk,1756236755,2025-08-25 02:29:19,2025-08-26 19:32:35,"jomyke (Score: 63): Modern diesels are far quieter, relative to old diesels;  ….must be modified if very loud at all.

1mzdci2,Does anyone know how/where to locate the front and rear end of the 2014-2017 Toyota Camry (Asian market) for a USDM Camry?,"We have started a project with our 2012-14 Camry to improve it here and there (for example, adding auto dual climate control, better touchscreen radio, new gauge cluster, updating the styling) and maybe even documenting all of our work on YouTube (we already recorded the start to our Camry improvements). I did a random google search to see what the AVV50 Camry looked like in other regions and discovered I LOVE the way the 2014-17 Asian Camry looks. I spent multiple nights studying the design and comparing part numbers, and I'm very confident that the front and rear end should fit onto a USDM AVV50 Camry (especially since the chassis are the EXACT same), it all might just clip together and bolt right up since the mounting points are very similar, if not the same. I have never tried getting a whole front end from a different country before so I'm not very knowledgeable for parts sourcing (at least without paying the same price as a new car would). Does anyone know a reliable website or an importer that can get ahold of these parts (even in used condition) and import them to the US (west coast region)?

I’ve got a beater that’s been giving me some problems lately. It’ll drive fine one minute, then cut out the next so I can’t move it. Sometimes it’ll start back up, sometimes it stalls completely. On top of that, there’s a strong gasoline smell around it.

I’ve also noticed that if I don’t drive it for a few days, it tends to jerk and act rough until I get it going again.

Could a car stall just from idling too long, or is this more likely a fuel or electrical issue? Anyone had these symptoms before? And is it dangerous to keep starting it until I can get it to a mechanic?

imprl59 (Score: 1): Flashing means you have a misfire, basically one or more cylinders isn't firing when it should.  The car doesn't necessarily know why it's misfiring, it just knows that it is - and when it's misfiring it could be dumping the fuel from that cylinder in to the exhaust which overheats the catalytic converter and leads to a very expensive bill.  You did the right thing by pulling over and turning it off.  If it starts flashing again you don't want to continue to drive it.

Car problems don't fix themselves as a rule.  They just go in to remission and wait for the absolute worst possible time to come back and be 10 times worse.  I would get the codes checked quickly to see what's stored now then come back with that info and someone here can give you suggestions on what it could be or recommend you get it to a mechanic.  

For future reference since you said you aren't familiar with this stuff yet - Flashing check engine I would drive slowly home if it was very close.  If the battery light comes on, turn off everyhing you can electrical and you have 15 minutes or so to get somewhere befor the vehicle stalls.  If you see either the oil or temp light then you pull over as quickly as possible and turn off the engine. Don't restart until the issue has been fixed.  I know that seems kind of basic but so many people don't know and I'd guess a good 50% of the cars that I saw get sent to the junkyard went because they were totally ruined by a driver who ""just had to get home"" and kept on driving when they should have stopped."

I bought a 2022 Hyundai i20 a few months ago and I love her, but ever since then the tyre pressure warning thing has beeped at me every single time I start the car, and the dash light is always on. When I press the TPMS reset button, it goes away but then beeps and comes back on after a couple of miles. The tyres are totally fine, I have quadruple checked them and even bumped them up to 38psi to see if that made a difference (spoiler alert - it didn’t). 

I know nothing about cars but I read that newer Hyundai’s use an “indirect” TPMS and I saw someone recommend that because of this, each tyre on an axel has to be the same brand and similar tread. Just wondering if anyone thinks this is likely what’s wrong with mine as I do have 2 different brands on my front axel. I have nothing to check the tread but I’d assume if they’re different brands then one of them must be newer, therefore less tread.

My main query though, without spending a stupid amount, with regards all the scratches (some fairly deep and have my wife to thank lol), is there a cheap and easy way I could semi-fix the paint issues. 

Like a putty or filler to go over those spots (fairly big as you can see) and once dry go over with the paint colour (haven’t got the number but I know it’s in the door) with a mini paint mix can from an auto store. 

I know it would be super obvious but I don’t really care. I either keep the car, or sell it and either way the scratches will be very visible or it will look slightly better with them covered and matches grey paint I can do myself.

I have a 2006 Audi A4 B6 2.7 TDI. From time to time, before starting the engine, I get two warning lights on my dashboard that stay on: ABS and ESP. If these lights don’t turn off, the car won’t start. The starter cranks normally, but the engine doesn’t fire up.

I bought a cheap OBD scanner to use with my phone and, surprisingly, whenever the lights stay on and I run an ABS module scan, the app shows **0 errors found**. Then, if I remove the key, insert it again, and try to start the car, it usually works without any problem. Only a couple of times this “workflow” didn’t work, and I had to run a full module scan (not just ABS but all modules, which takes about 2 minutes) — and then the car started fine.

This doesn’t happen all the time, in fact, it’s pretty rare, but it does happen. I went to my mechanic and he told me to unplug the ABS module connector, blow some compressed air into it, spray a bit of WD-40 electrical contact cleaner, and try driving it for a while.

While I'm thinking this was a theft attempt since I don't really want to think about the possibility of a door lock spontaneously combusting somehow, I am morbidly curious about what seems to be scorch marks around the handle and where the lock cap seems to be. Any ideas on what the potential thieves were trying to do? Melting the lock mechanism somehow? Anyways, am thinking on possible ways of remediating this. The vehicle has remote unlock so the physical tumbler isn't strictly necessary. Other than buying and sticking on a new lock cover, any recommendations on what can be done? can I just fill the lock hole in with epoxy of some kind and be done with it, or it it worth exploring replacing the entire assembly?

The more cutting oil you can use to keep the bit cool the less time this will take."

The upper control arms would fine is the bushing and ball joints are still good. If the rust is all you're basing needing to replace them on, it's not there yet. I also couldn't see what you meant about needing front bed mounts.

Oh, I see what you mean in the mounts, it must have been rear ended to shove the bed into the cab like that. I was wondering why the back wheel looked like it was so far back! Again, verify those mounts are actually broken - they'd be welded onto the bed, and it will take a lot more than you think to replace them. Might need someone with a frame puller to straighten out the bed (not necessarily the frame itself).

It's a Toyota in the prime of its life. Maintain it well. Clean mud and salt out of the places it gets stuck, and ride on. Those things are good for double that mileage. Just check maintenance intervals and see if you're supposed to replace timing components or anything, and you'll get a lot of use out of her.

2017 F150 XLT 4WD, first time poster and novice mechanic here. 

Recently changed front brake pads on driver and passenger side, and changed passenger side rotor with the help of good friend who is well versed in this. Repair conducted on Saturday morning.

Passenger side rotor was changed due to significant and uneven wear on the rotor (image 1). Replaced driver side (image 2) and passenger side (image 3) for reference. One single brake pad was worn all the way down, but not the pad on the back side of the rotor. Rotor presented damage in a very short amount of time. My brakes had been squeaking but no visible issues until I noticed issues braking while driving. I tried to be as diligent as possible with visual inspections. 

Since changing out the pads the driver side rotor is showing signs of the pad burning (image 4), is giving off tremendous and extremely excessive amounts of heat, even on short drivers; measurably more by a significant margin than the passenger side. There is at times, a very very strong odor of burning when stopped. Currently no negative feedback while actively braking or coming to complete stop.

I drive a 2021 CRV Honda if that makes any difference.

The screws holding the housing lid? And what bolts missing? One of those two? Or some.. other bolt? You get a new one by taking one that you DO have to the hardware store and finding another one that matches it. Unless it's a special bolt like a head bolt or something, then you get it from the auto parts store.


You unscrew things by using the right tool for the job. There are different sizes, even on Phillips Head screws, and using the wrong one will lead to stripping. So first make sure you're using the right tool for the right fastener. After that its a matter of using it correctly. Pushing into it while turning, and stopping if it starts to cam out. Using an impact, penetrating oil, a breaker bar, or some combination of all 3 is how stuck things come out, usually.

1n02nri,2006 Buick Lucerne is nearing the end of its life cycle - junk or sell?,"I've been driving an '06 Buick Lucerne that I bought from my Grandma (yes, really) for 9.5 years and 120K miles (on top of the existing 10.5 years and 100k miles it had when I bought it). It's finally time to move on from it, though it has been a very nice, affordable, and reliable ride for all these years (It's still mostly quiet & mostly smooth to drive and has nice trim with a comfy interior & great AC!) It has the ""good"" 3.8L V6 GM engine in it. I have meticulous maintenance records - some work done by pros, some work done by myself/family. It's got a good set of tires and wheels on it.

That said, I've been saying for *years* that ""as soon as something major is wrong with it, I'm moving on""... now is that time. Have a confirmed coolant leak coming out where the engine and transmission come together and a mechanic (plus my dad) said it would be nearly $1000 to fix and something else big and internal may very well go wrong soon after. So far, I haven't even had to add coolant, but it is a matter of time.

Other things going on with it include: 

* A small scraping noise when braking that popped up recently (multiple mechanics have said the brakes are fine, it's ""just a noise"") 
* An occasional clunk from the transmission if I either try to hit the gas too fast after shifting gears or when going from 2nd to 3rd gear after it's hot from driving quite a while
* The replacement suspension parts are basically junk because everything after market these days is junk and also the rear springs are original and really worn out. Fine driving alone, with passengers it makes me self conscious because it is a pretty bumpy ride.
* It also has a busted front bumper cover (from a very, very low-speed ""collision"" with a retaining wall while trying to maneuver in a driveway). It has a salvage title because it was not worth enough to repair.
* I have had to add a bit oil between oil changes the last couple times which didn't use to be necessary.
* Some of the power locks and windows work unreliably or not at all (thankfully not on the driver's door)
* A couple nicks, stains, and scrapes in the interior but all in all, in pretty good shape inside

So the advice / discussion I'm looking for is: Would you try to fix anything? Add any stop leak or transmission fix? Would you try to sell it? If so, for how much?

Unfortunately my car knowledge is quite limited, so I appreciate any wisdom here. 

I recently purchased a used CPO 2021 Subaru Forester in Canada with 50k km. It felt fine on the test drive (engine was warm - important because…)

Upon picking up the car, there was a very obvious transmission issue. Upon accelerating from stop, within 2-3 seconds, there’s a very harsh shift from 1 to 2 gear, to the point that the car uncomfortably lunges. It’s reproducible when engine is cold. This problem is a lot less noticeable after 30m-1h, when engine has warmed up.

I brought it to a local mechanic (which, now I know, I should have done in the first place). His assessment was the following

-able to recreate the transmission issue that I noted. He wondered if it was the valve body in the transmission that’s failed 

-Front brakes were machined and rotors were quite thin 

-The tires have significant weathering/dry rot/cracks

My understanding is that cracked tires alone should have disqualified the car from passing CPO, and should have been changed. I’ve also learned that the rotors have to meet a minimum thickness, but I don’t know exactly how thick.

I brought this up with the dealership, who assured me the brakes and tires met CPO qualifications.

While I don’t know how to take and share photos of the brakes, I figured I would share some photos of the tires. Do they look dry rotted/cracked?

I am currently dealing with a very frustrating situation, and I'd like to know if anyone else has dealt with something like this before and what I should do.

  
This past Friday, my service engine light came on, so I took it to a mechanic I have been to previously for my old car. I have an extended car warranty with Carefree Car Protection, and the shop let me know that they have worked with my warranty before and could do the work. They started a claim with them they began the work. I paid for my portion of the costs (Deductible, oil change, and non-covered items). 

I took a Lyft home since it wouldn't be until the next day that they would have it ready.

On Saturday, they called me to let me know that they haven't been paid by the warranty yet, so if I wanted to pick up the car, I would have to pay the remaining balance. I figured it was the weekend, and they just haven't processed the claim fully. 

That brings us to this morning, where I have gone back and forth between the shop and the warranty customer service, with the shop claiming they have sent in the information the warranty company is asking for multiple times, and the warranty company telling me that the shop is not sending the correct information. The shop's manager has expressed frustration to the point that he isn't going to be working with them anymore, and now I am stuck. 

For context, the two documents the warranty needs are their final receipt of the parts ordered (apparently, the shop keeps sending the quote) and documentation on how much they charge in labor per hour, signed by the owner. 

I'm not sure if this is common or who is being the difficult one in this situation, but I feel so frustrated that I can't get my car unless I pay out of pocket when the shop told me they would work with my warranty.

1mzpcrl,2019 Nissan Sentra not starting,"Been having a years-long issue with this car that has gotten immensely worse as of late. Most days, it does this thing where it doesn't start when I push the button for the first few times. Not sure if weather is an *actual* determining factor or if this is coincidental but I've noticed this issue is more frequent in the summer or in hot weather.

That said, persistence usually does the trick. Eventually, it starts. It used to take only a handful of tries. A couple minutes at the most. Yesterday, it took nearly 30 minutes of endless effort, and of course, it was at a time when I taking my nephew to the skating rink for his birthday. Boy, did he cry when I said we shouldn't risk it because I didn't want to get stuck with no way back home. I felt like shit.

Anecdote aside, that was notably the first time it's gotten THAT bad. Fast forward to now, and it's still not starting after 30 minutes of effort. Postponing my nephew's birthday plans was heartbreaking but missing ANY work under my current financial status is severely detrimental to my well-being.

So here I am. First, I was wondering if I should even continue to risk the continuous effort of starting it under these circumstances. Even if it does start, I'm afraid to drive anywhere at the risk of getting stuck. 

Second, and most importantly, I wanted to know if there was an affordable solution to fixing the car before taking it to the dealership.

1mzcus9,Hyundai Santa Fe XL 3.3 V6 Engine issues,"Hi,

I am looking for some help/advice.

I recently bought a Santa Fe XL with 187,000kms from a third-party used car dealership and I was confident in the purchase because the mechanical inspection looked good and the carfax stats “longblock replaced” at the Hyundai dealership.

I had to park the car for a couple weeks before I could insurance and registration figured out. However, within 30min of driving it all the above faults codes come up particularly P0019 & bank 2 misfires.

I spoke to the used car dealership they basically said it worked fine when it left. You messed it up in two weeks. Your problem.

I took it to the Hyundai dealership and told them you guys did the engine what’s wrong? Can you share what you did? They told me they diagnosed the car found the faults (P0019 and misfires) and recommended an engine replacement. 

They claim they never repaired anything. Even though Carfax specifically says otherwise. 

They also can’t share the records because it has information of the previous owner and it’s a “privacy issue” even though I have stated you can crop all that out and just tell me what did you guys do?

I have done some research and seems it’s an issue with where the cam phaser and the cam shaft meet. 

What I’m thinking:
•Contacted Hyundai Canada for help as lots of other people had this issue
•Asked Hyundai Canada to investigate the dealer ship since there is a discrepancy and it seems like the dealer is hiding something. They don’t want to stand behind their work. (Carfax doesn’t up date on its own. The source names the dealership indicating they submitted documentation to have this on the carfax)

My take:

The engine runs fine aside from the flashing engine light. I have cleared it and it comes back eventually (5-20min) later.

If I can fix the engine for $500-2000 I can invest that because the car is clean interior and exterior. 

But if it’s $2000+ or a full engine replacement (which I’ll get a used engine so no guarantees how long that will last) I’m throwing the car away.

Your help:
• Have you had the issue before? Was it the cam phaser? - What was the fix?
• Any other issues that cause these fault codes?
• Is it worth fixing?
• Any other options then dumping the car?

Any help is appreciated. Yes, it was a bad call but I needed a car. Yes, used car dealerships are a scam. Honestly, I’ll get a better buying the car from a car thief. 

I won’t buy another car from used dealership again but I need help on this one.

Ok.  So that's your radiator temperature sensor.  You have to have the clip OUT, then you can install the sensor, and then you put the clip in, with the open part going towards the bottom, as shown in the picture.  The clip has to be out before the sensor will seat.  Also, unplugging the connector may help, just what I would do, since it's pissing me off just looking at it in the way.

Last year a belt blew, and in the process it blew out our AC compressor, which we replaced last spring. This spring the ac stopped working and after a few recharges it was clear there was a serious leak. Mechanic #1, a good guy doing a side gig out of his house, held on to the car for over a month trying to fit it in. His diagnosis was another bad compressor, so we ordered the parts - but ultimately he was unable to do the job because he needed a pro lift to get the car up (he has a jerryrigged system at home and there’s some rust under the car that made that a shitshow).

SO - we took it to mechanic number two with all the parts for him to do the repair, but he just called and said prior to pulling the compressor he did another dye test and found that it is NOT the compressor but the evaporator core that‘s bad. He isn’t in a position to pull the dash and is warning it’s a 900-1500 buck job.

I’m scrambling to return the compressor (ugh) and we are trying to figure out whether to put this much money and effort into our old girl. It’s been hot as \*&ck here this summer and driving without AC is miserable (plus she‘s our tow vehicle - we camp up in Canada and that‘s a long drive with no AC and a dog that refuses not to stick his head completely out the window).

We don’t know how much more life we can expect out of her. BUT we are pretty broke - getting something else right now would require dipping into emergency savings. Though maybe the combo of coming tariffs and her age make now the time?

I'm looking to pick up a project as a second car and need a hand with inspiration. My current daily has me set for speed and practicality, what I want is a shitbox that'll be more spirited and keep giving me things to do.

I've got an option at the moment to get a cheap Polo 9n, but it's sat just outside the sphere of parts and upgrades availability and honestly wants somebody with shorter legs.

Aiming for an initial cost of £2k - I don't want something good out of the gate, I want something with character and potential.

I prefer Hatchbacks, sorry but Mazdas don't do it for me.

I like unusual, which is why I've not settled for a Golf Mk4. I was really tempted by the Polo cos it'd catch people off guard. My first car was a pink Almera 1.5 for example, it was surprisingly quick and definitely turned some heads.

Needs:
* Petrol
* Good parts and upgrades availability
* Fits a 6ft+ person nicely (sorry classic Mini, it just wasn't meant to be)
* Nice performance ceiling once it's had some time, effort, and probably a nice turbo thrown at it

Turns out, they found my car because they were investigating the murder of Rico Andrews who was shot in Battersea on 5/10/2023. Two individuals were arrested over the murder—Tyrone Attwood and Joshua Eno—who were charged and which the prosecution say was over a stolen high value motorbike.

Which makes me feel sick, as my Jag was literally stolen in front of me and I tried to stop them, meaning I could’ve been shot over it. In hindsight, it was a stupid thing to do but it was pure reaction on adrenaline.

Attwood pleaded guilty to stealing my Jag (but not the murder) and got… **any guesses** on his sentence?",313,1756145678.0,74,CartalkUK,1756236755,2025-08-25 18:14:38,2025-08-26 19:32:35,"Negative_Innovation (Score: 261): 18 months suspended sentence with a 12 month driving ban?

1mzs02m,"[Advice] Broke down in Germany — garage can’t find fault, want €1k just to investigate. Worth trying to drive it back to UK?","Hi all, bit of a saga so bear with me:

I’m a Brit. On the way back to England from a trip in Germany, my 2020 SEAT Arona (16,000 miles) broke down on an A-road near Simmern.

The clutch pedal went straight to the floor and I couldn’t engage gears, so ADAC towed me to their partner garage in Kirchberg.

ADAC said at the roadside the clutch was broken and would need replacing, but I then requested they tow it to a local SEAT dealer who tested it and said:

* OBD/ODIS scan showed no fault codes.

* Clutch pedal pressure is back and hydraulics seem fine.

* They can’t see an obvious problem without removing the gearbox and clutch for inspection, which would cost me ~€987 just for labour.

* Worst case, it could be clutch + flywheel, but they won’t know until they open it up.

* They also said the low brake fluid ADAC noted isn’t related.


The dealer has been very communicative and promised not to start any work without my written approval. They’ve also said they’ll ask SEAT about a possible goodwill contribution because of the low mileage, but the car is out of its 3-year warranty.


Where I’m stuck:

I don’t really want to sink ~€1k+ into exploratory labour abroad, especially when the original fault has mysteriously “gone” and the car seems driveable again.

I’m wondering whether I should just fly back out, collect the car, take out European breakdown cover for the day, and try to drive it back to the UK. Once home I could hand it to the SEAT dealer I bought it from and hold them to account directly.

BUT: most breakdown insurers exclude “pre-existing faults,” so I’m worried the cover would be void if I admitted it broke down last week. On the other hand, paying €2–3k for clutch/flywheel in Germany feels painful if I could just limp it home.


Questions for anyone who’s been here:

1. Has anyone successfully driven a car home from Europe after a breakdown like this?

2. Am I insane for considering driving it back without repair?

3. Any tips on short-term European breakdown cover that definitely includes UK repatriation?

4. Should I just cut my losses and let the German SEAT dealer open it up?


Really appreciate any advice — this has been a huge stress for me and my family.

EDIT: I've just heard back and apparently, although they said pressure had returned to the pedal, it's still not drivable and SEAT won't contribute to any of the cost given I've been having the car serviced annually at non-SEAT-approved garages (i.e. independent garages).

1mzqace,Considering a 'downgrade' (GLC to XC60) - advice needed,"Hi,

I currently own and drive a 68 plate Merc GLC Urban with 42k miles on the clock. I've had it for a year and have enjoyed it, but I put it up for auction via Carwow at the weekend to see how it would do, and a dealership has offered £17,500 for it.

I'm tempted to sell it and instead buy myself a [64 plate Volvo R-Design](https://www.williamsmotor-company.co.uk/used-volvo-xc60-crewe-cheshire-7232695) with 99k miles for £8k, essentially pocketing nearly £10k.

The reason for doing so is because I've been on a personal finance journey, and this would allow me to clear debt, build up an emergency fund, and finally start to be able to invest a bit.

While it's a lovely car, I feel the 68 plate GLC is 'mid level' enough by today's standards, that moving to the Volvo won't feel like a massive step down - it still has all the essentials I need, plus I've always personally loved the look of the original XC60s.

Only consideration is that I do around 16k miles per year with work, so need the engine to be reliable. Going by the Volvo's MOT, it hasn't had a lot of major defects or advisories, but the garage has said it doesn't have a full service history but does have maintenance records and receipts, with the timing belt done in 2023.

Another point is that when I bought the GLC, it included a 3 year warranty (2 years left on it), so this would be wasted somewhat.

Does anyone know how reliable these D4 engines are?

Am I taking a risk by moving to a car with 99k miles on the clock?

Am I crazy to get rid of a car with 2 years warranty left that I purchased?

I'm just keen to free up the equity that I have in it, but constantly second guess myself.

I think that any car comes with a level of risk. Overall, Volvos have a great reputation. 99k miles on a car that's been well-maintained shouldn't be looked down on, in my opinion (although I'm speaking from a place of ignorance, as I'm not familiar with D4 engines). See if the dealership is willing to give some drive-away warranty, and use some of the 10k to get an immediate service/ full check done on the vehicle, so that you can have some reassurance.

1mzmel9,"Buying new car under £11k. 4 options, advice needed","I’m looking to upgrade from my 2012 Corsa 1.2L (83bhp) to something newer, with a budget of around £11k.

At first I was leaning towards a small SUV like the Kia Stonic or Skoda Kamiq, but after doing some research (and reading posts here) it seems like a hatchback might be the smarter choice. It would have better fuel economy, lower running costs, and usually quicker too.

I’ve narrowed it down to a few options, but I’d love some advice or other suggestions I might not have considered. My ideal car would be:

	•	Similar size to my Corsa (around 4–4.2m) for easier parking

	•	Good fuel economy and a low–medium insurance group

	•	ULEZ compliant (most newer cars are anyway)

	•	Quicker than my current 0–60 in 13s

	•	Boot at least as big as my Corsa’s (285L)

	•	Bonus: cruise control


The cars I’m currently looking at:

	1.	Seat Ibiza – 2017+, 1.0L, 95bhp, ~38k miles

	2.	Kia Rio – 2017+, 1.0/1.2L, 99bhp, ~37k miles

	3.	Toyota Yaris – 2017+, 1.5L, ~109bhp, ~32k miles

	4.	VW Golf – 2014, 1.4 TSI Bluemotion, 120bhp, ~20k miles

The Golf looks like the best all-rounder on paper, but it’s also the oldest, so I’m a bit concerned about resale value down the line. The Yaris seems great too, but it’s smaller overall with a tighter boot. The Kia and Seat look quite similar to each other.

Other than a Corsa E I am an advocate of EV's as long as you can charge on a cheap rate at home. If you cant charge at home I wouldnt recommend one. About 2 1/2p per mile for fuel compared to a petrol being 15p if you are getting 40mpg, servicing costs a lot cheaper, more reliable as less moving parts to go wrong, cheaper tax for many (check the new tax bands to be sure) and the performance of most easily beats comparable ICE cars."

A few years ago the government introduced a tax on new motorhomes. They u[\-turned on it pretty quick,](https://www.caravanguard.co.uk/news/motorhome-tax-rules-reversed-22799/) but had already closed the loophole - which was to register a motorhome as a van then apply for its vehicle type to be changed to motor caravan. They insisted at the time this was nothing to do with the tax class, so have been pretty stubborn in leaving it basically impossible to convert a panel van to a motor caravan.

They've since confirmed that if it meets the internal requirements for a motor caravan you can drive at the higher speed limits with no further action needed:

>It is important to remember that even if the vehicle’s body type is not changed to ‘motor caravan’, the vehicle can still be used for this purpose as long as the keeper is satisfied the converted vehicle meets [the required internal features for motor caravans](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/registering-a-diy-caravan).

Ah you ask, what happens if you go through a speed camera? You get a NIP. You say state not guilty, send them some photos of the interior of your van and they cancel the ticket. Now there is some annoyance here in that some forces won't cancel the ticket if you are, say, at 72 on a dual carriage way when they wouldn't have issued one for a car at the same speed.

Yes, it's a massive administrative burden for the police. Yes it would be incredible easy to sort by allowing the DVLA to re-register converted panel vans. Yes police officers do get themselves in a tizzy about it from time to time. But thats the government for you I guess.
