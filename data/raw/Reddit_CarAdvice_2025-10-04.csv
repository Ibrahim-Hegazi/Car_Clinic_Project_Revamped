1nxf6t2,How to change oil without a jack or stands.,"So, i have a 2005 trailblazer ls. And only have the factory jack. I, as all aspiring mechanics tend to do, had the brilliant idea to try and save money by changing my own oil. LITTLE DID I KNOW that i need to remove a SKID PLATE to even access the drain plug. Then ANOTHER PLATE to access the filter. I am broke, and do not have money to buy a jack or stands. Any ideas?.


TLDR: I am stupid, how do i get my suv higher up to remove my skidplate and change my oil without a proper jack and stands.

Solved: thanks all who answered. I will just get some ramps, maybe chucks if they are needed. Then save for a jack and stands.

Update: it may have taken an hour and a half, but it got done. Needed to pull out the flathead for the filter, and i think i found a trans leak, but its done. Sounds better too.",1,1759535799.0,30,MechanicAdvice,1759606257,2025-10-03 23:56:39,2025-10-04 19:30:57,"notrewoh (Score: 13): You could drive up on a curb or make some ramps out of wood.

1nxf51a,Diagnosing a catalytic converter code P0420 - help?,"Hi, 2016 Ford Fiesta SE, the 4 cylinder 1.6 liter, owner here! So I have been noticing some poor throttle response, and poor gas mileage for my car. I've noticed my city streets MPG dropping to about 20-25 ish, which is unusual. I got an Oxygen Sensor 1 Bank 1 error so I ordered a Bosch Direct Fit Oxygen Sensor replacement and installed it. Went and also opened the throttle body looks good to me, I replaced it about a year ago. I've been driving around a bit trying to see any differences, then today I got the P0420 catalytic efficiency below threshold. Oof.

Looking for some advice, I pulled out the reader and loaded up Forscan. I had the car idling for about ten minutes and logged some of the data output. I collected the numerical data and put it into excel, you can see some of the charts here in the Imgur post. I'll also note that, I'm not sure what variables I want to look for here, I was kind of guessing, but I pulled the ones for O2S11, and for S12, and Cat temperature, thinking that might be a good starting place.

images of the graphs on imgur - [https://imgur.com/a/4RnGy2P](https://imgur.com/a/4RnGy2P)

As far as the categorical data goes -

|No|No Fault|No Fault|

2006 chevy uplander 3.6L v6

No error codes, no warning lights. Only a message that the awd system has been disabled.


Canadian t ire has replaced two actuator solenoids.

It has not resolved the issue.

They know according to them that its the actuator solenoid because when they jump the connector. 

The message goes away.

They want to try for a 3rd time to put in a new one but if i do it a third time and it doesnt work. I loose my ability to get a refund.


Im all out of ideas here, this vehicle is in amazing condition and less then 150k km on it..


If anyone has any other ideas on how to solve this. It would be greatly appreciated.

1. Just bite the bullet. Everything else on the car is relatively fine. After all, a new car payment would be around $400 per month. So either way im paying $400.

2. Just give up on power steering. My first car, a Nissan Sentra 1987 had manual steering and it was fine, though i understand modern cars are not built to be manual.

My first issue was the ac was not working, ac compressor would engage for 5 seconds, then not engage entirely for the rest of the trip. Got the coolant overheat symbol went to get it checked. Mechanic said reason why the ac compressor is not engaging is the engine is overheating. We discovered that the radiator cap was emptying but no leaks and both oil and coolant reservoirs were still separated. Then, once the mechanic poured water down the radiator hose through the radiator cap trace amounts of oil mixed with the coolant until we got the infamous chocolate milkshake.

The diagnosis was a head gasket failure, and i was advised to replace the thermostat and radiator. To clean the sludge the engine was opened and they discovered that because of the overheating the piston rings were loosened/damaged. All was good and well, head gasket replaced, engine was flushed, coolant was flushed, replaced thermostat, radiator, piston o rings, cylinder head was resurfaced, ac compressor oil and freon topped up. Paid the bill but after driving home tested the ac, it would disengage entirely and i got a cheap bluetooth OBDII i saw the coolant temp was 117 degrees celsius (242.6F).

1nxaqr1,Chrysler Pacifica 2018 - Wont start (occasionally),"Hi All:

I've got a strange issue with my 2018 Chrysler Pacifica and was wondering if anyone else may have experienced this.  So a few weeks ago, the auto stop (which I despise) would kick in and the car would not restart at all.  You'd have to wait a few minutes, then if you were lucky, you could get it started again.  Took it to the mechanic (who I trust), he said something about it being that Chryslers can be a little funny about having authentic Chrysler batteries.  Turned out the auxiliary needed replacing, and they also did a flash update to the computer (Its odd because I replaced the auxiliary last year, but whatever).  The car ran fine for about 2 weeks - then it happened again (was able to get it started after a few minutes).  It then ran fine for about another week or so, no issues at all.  I've been hitting the disable auto stop button every time I get in there, but sometimes I don't always remember (trying to make it a habit)  

The other day the wife took it shopping, and she could not get it started (after running a couple of errands).  After about an hour of me fiddling with it in the mall parking lot I gave up and called to have it towed to the Chrysler dealer (the thought pattern is they see these things day in/day out & I would hope they'd know) - engine light was on.  Well, the tow truck guy comes by (3 hours later), the car starts right up - one thing I did notice was he used the fob to start it up (not sure if that's a factor).  I had him tow it to the dealer (covered by insurance so I didn't mind).  

The dealer looked at it for 2 days and could not reproduce this issue.  At this point with no codes or it not happening consistently, I'm keeping a code reader in it in the event that this happens again so I can at least grab something should this happen again.

Maybe that's why I see these older 2GRs eat through valve cover gaskets and silicone sealer, making it more prone to oil leaks. The newer variants that used 0W-20 stay clean even at high mileages.

Replace PCV valves and both of their hoses (they get rock hard), and switch to Valvoline restore and protect oil, but it will accelerate oil leaks. Stick with 5W-30, switching viscosity won't help. 

Both valve cover gaskets are very possible to do in the car, the front VVT oil line can be bent out of the way and bent back into place. The rear bank (bank 1) has a rubber line so no issue there, just gotta undo the wire harness enough to make space. As always, use all OEM gaskets and parts."

(Sorry for lengthy explanation but thought I'd include as much as possible as I'm very stressed about this) 

I have a Seat Leon 2.0 TDI 2016 - Recently I had a coolant low message, and coolant temp reached 100 degrees for the first time - I topped up when cool and few days later it kept going down. The garage I usually go to, pointed out that it could be the heater matrix so went ahead with the change and hoped for the best, but sadly coolant is still disappearing... On my next visit the garage performed a head test, to see if there are gases in the coolant expansion tank and it come back positive (it changed from blue to slight hint of green, but not fully yellow) they advised a head gasket repair is required (quote of 2k with timing belt and water pump) 

My slight annoyance was that perhaps the head test should of been done first before the matrix replaced (which was £700) the garage is sure that the slight blockage of the matrix caused the car to overheat and was the starting point of my head gasket going... 

Is it the right thing to go ahead with the head gasket replacement or do I investigate a different area of the engine that may be causing this?

Hi! I’m Hannah, new here. I have a 2009 RAV4 Limited that’s been making odd noises- kind of a grinding rattle. I’ve taken it to several  mechanics & they think they fix it by repairing my muffler, etc but it’s clearly not addressing the issue. 

Last year I found a video online that sounded like the same issue (?) & they said it’s a Toyota specific problem that can’t be repaired but doesn’t cause problems- but I can’t find that video again!

Other info: RAV has 165xxx miles. Oil has been changed faithfully. I’m the 2nd owner. This started in the last year or so. Now it happens several times on a 10 min drive. It’s been happening at 30-45 mph, driving straight and basically flat. I think it’s when I accelerate lightly. To me, it sounds metallic, like a vibrating rattle from the engine area (?).

1nx7nb2,Daytime Running Light only works with headlights off,"2018 Toyota Camry XSE, 2.5L 4cyl, 100k miles

This has been happening for quite some time, but no one has been able to figure it out. When the headlights are off, both DRLs work. When the headlights come on, driver's side DRL goes off. The DRLs on this car are bright during the day, but they stay on and dim when the low beams come on. I'm only including this because some think the DRLs should go off completely when low beams are activated, which isn't the case. The relay for this same DRL went bad around 30k miles (just hit 100k last week😭) in which Toyota replaced it under warranty. I had a prior bumper repair that occurred from interstate debris, and they actually tried to blame the issue on that before finally diagnosing and finding the relay problem.

When I originally inspected the light, I noticed the cover that’s normally on the back of the assembly was missing (which was left off by Toyota although I’d never be able to prove that). Fast forward to about a month ago, I had sudden water pump failure along with an ECM code, so I had the dealership fix it. Lo and behold the cap is back now! Slightly irrelevant, but I wanted to add that. All of that to say, I’m curious if moisture could’ve potentially caused this to happen?

All ideas and suggestions are appreciated. Could the relay once again be an issue although it works part of the time? A while back, I swapped it with another of the same size/power (I can't remember which one now), and whatever component I swapped it to worked. I would hate to buy an entire new headlight assembly if there may be a simple solution out there…or worse, buy a new headlight and still have this issue.

1nx6m4k,Mechanic probably put the wrong coolant in my car a year back,"Hello everyone,

I had a mechanic who I used when I got my first car (Mazda 2 from 2009). He seemed great at first, but as time progressed, the more I think this guy doesn’t know what he is doing.

I took it for a service about a year ago, he topped up the coolant and told me that the car takes red coolant. Note that the manual says use FL-22, which is a yellow/green colour.

About 10 months later, I notice the coolant has dropped in level by quite a lot, I go to see him, he says radiator leak and he proceeds to just top up the coolant all the way (way past the max mark) with standard tap water. The level remained the same since there, so I don’t think that there is actually a radiator leak.

Winter is on the way, and the top-up of water is only supposed to be a temporary thing. I’m also concerned about the red coolant part when it could be the completely wrong type.

Is it worth doing a full flush of the radiator coolant (remove stop cap, fill radiator and reservoir with deionised water, run engine with heater on hot until operating temp, clear and repeat again 2-3 times and then fill radiator and reservoir with FL22) or is it the case that if it was a problem it would have shown up by now?",1,1759514950.0,5,MechanicAdvice,1759606257,2025-10-03 18:09:10,2025-10-04 19:30:57,"AdProfessional8948 (Score: 3): So the color doesn't matter at all.

1. A failing CTS will often give the Engine Control Unit (ECU) a false reading. When the engine is warm, a faulty sensor might tell the ECU the engine is still cold, or that it is overheating, leading to a severely incorrect fuel mixture (either too rich or too lean) which causes power loss under load. This is a very common and inexpensive fix on older VWs.

2. The TPS tells the ECU how far the throttle is open. A failure, especially an intermittent one in a specific range of movement (like the 2-4RPM demand range), can cause the ECU to abruptly cut fuel/spark, mimicking ""taking your foot off the pedal."" This is a known issue on Mk3 Golf injection systems.

3. Under high load and demand (uphill, higher RPM), the fuel system needs to deliver maximum fuel. A partially clogged fuel filter or a weak/failing fuel pump may not be able to maintain the necessary fuel pressure, causing the engine to starve for fuel and lose power until the demand drops.

4. The ECU Relay, often Relay on this model, controls power to the ECU and is known to fail due to poor solder joints, especially when hot. This can lead to intermittent power cuts to the ECU, causing momentary power loss or stalling.

1nwywim,Has Flat rate time bill TIME gone up significantly?,"2020 Mercedes Sprinter 2500 SRW

I am a retired (Toyota) Technician - been out of the industry for 10+ years.  I escaped to a desk position with a local company, one of my responsibilities is management of our small fleet of vehicles.  

This week I put our Sprinter in for service at the dealer for a few items, one being a warranty EGR cleaning for a bucking sensation.  I asked for a list of recommended services, trying to get juice vs squeeze for DIY vs having them take care of it.  I know their shop labor RATE is high being a dealer, but the amount of flat rate hours they are billing for each job is higher than I expected.  I expect to pay through the teeth at a dealer, but 0.8hr for the engine air filter? 2.0hr for an alignment where the only adjustable angle is front toe?  2.5hr for replace rotors/pads is higher than I used to get to machine rotors and replace pads, not just smack the rotors off and throw them away (I am aware you cannot machine these rotors).  I've done all of these repairs myself on our older Sprinter and there was nothing special or weird about any of these jobs.

Apples to oranges, Toyota vs Merc/Sprinter are totally different worlds.  If the techs are getting these labor times great for them, it's entirely possible I was getting hosed at my former employer.  

Any Sprinter techs sound off on this?

Yesterday, the Check Engine light came on for the first time. There are no strange noises, no loss of power, and the car feels completely normal.  

I ran a diagnostic today and got code **P0420**. The mechanic told me that the issue is most likely the catalytic converter (“environmental converter”). I cleared the code and drove about 20 km, and the light came back again.  

Honestly, I’m not sure if it could be a simpler issue, like the O2 sensor, or if the catalytic converter really needs replacement.

Go take it on a real drive and get the engine and exhaust eally hot, drive like a maniac and accelerate hard, go on a highway and drive the speed limit. All this is an attempt to clear the catalytic converter.

Then you can clear the code and go for a drive again. If it still comes back, then I'd do some actual diag and inspect the signals from your o2 sensors. Those signals show if your cat is even working, or if maybe the sensor is old/dirty and is reacting slower than expected.

Replacing the catalytic converter is the last ditch effort, since it's the most expensive part in this chain.

Same for the bushings that hold the sway bar itself - might as well replace both at the same time, too - they should be cheaper than the end links. 

The sway bar helps keep the car from ""leaning"" in turns, especially at higher speeds.  It helps keep the tires firmly planted on the road when going through turns. 

You're probably not going to have an accident right away but your emergency maneuvering ability which includes quick sudden back-and-forth turns is suffering now (think: even basic ""object avoidance"" maneuvers like dodging a squirrel running across the road, or some road debris you didn't see far enough ahead).

Good luck!
  
(To your original question, this part is not as essential as other suspension parts - i.e., your wheel is not in immediate danger of falling off or anything - but it does help with better control of your car in turns.  You will notice a firmer, more taut feeling of steering control once your sway bar end links and bushings have been replaced. Don't let it go so long where it may break at that joint, and the end link and sway bar ends are dangling around under there and prone to interfering with other parts of your suspension.

Do you know how to do the ""12 & 6"" and ""9 & 3,"" grab-your-tire-while-car-is-elevated wiggle test?  Google it, and/or search it on YouTube.  Too much play in the wheel/tire assembly while attempting to wiggle it while holding the tire in the ""12 & 6"" position indicates possible control arm and ball joint issues.

Unless you are now experiencing definite clunking sounds going over speed bumps and/or see visible evidence of oil leaking from your shocks or an actual broken spring, probably hold off on replacing any of those.

You could jack the car up now and do the ""12 & 6"" and ""9 & 3"" wiggle tests to see if there are other obvious suspected points of ""looseness"" in your suspension or you could just wait until you first replace the end links and sway bar bushings to solve that known problem and then take the car out and see how it then drives."

- Motive Gear Performance ring and pinion gear (brand new)
- Mustang with 86 000 miles

I have told them that I have been advised to not give out my VIN to anyone I don’t know. They are now saying if I refuse to give it they will cancel order.
Question: is it safe to give out the VIN number, or am I better off just looking elsewhere for the card?

Lmao, wut? Who told you this. What do you think they'll do with your vin?

Your VIN SHOULD be used every single time you order parts, especially for Mercedes.

As an Auto Repair shop, EVERY TIME We order a part from a dealership for a customer, we give them your VIN to make sure it's the right part. This also applies to anytime we order anything serious online for vehicles like Satnav cards, computers, modules, etc. 

If ANYONE is selling you a SatNav Card without asking for your VIN, they're idiots who will sell you the wrong thing.

Silent_Blade (Score: 2): 13 years ago, I got my 1988 Camaro with the 2.8L V6 running and drove it 25 miles on backroads from a field at my parent's house where it had sat for about 8 years to my house. The car was about as rough as yours; lots of patina. The engine was gutless and leaked oil. It was such a fun night bombing that thing home with a bad alternator hoping the battery had enough charge to get me there. I tell this because if your car runs as is right now, I would very much recommend driving it for a bit. Just experience it and love it as it is before you put a ton of work in it. The very next day after I got it to my house I started pulling the drivetrain. I stripped the interior and tore the whole car apart. That was the easy part. I did some work here and there, but nothing substantial for the next 11 years. Moved houses, took the shell of a car with along with the boxes and boxes of parts. Felt guilty about not doing anything with it, but also didn't really have any motivation to actually finish it. Had I driven it a little more before starting the engine swap I am sure I would have had the motivation I needed to get it done sooner. It's ""done"" now, and I love driving it. It's been 2 years of welding in a floor pan, priming, painting, interior, suspension, wiring (oh so much frickin' wiring), and that's not even including the work on the LS swap. I had so much fun doing it once I finally got going on it. But the whole time I didn't even know if I'd like the car when I got it done. Some days I wanted to light it on fire and walk away. This all being said, if you want any advice or guidance feel free to PM me. I love seeing someone's project car on the road and if I can help that happen faster then that's great. Last piece of advice I have: make the car YOU want. If you want a perfect paint job and an immaculate interior, do that. If you don't really care don't feel bad about what it looks like. My paint job looks like crap and I have runs, orange peel, and dents all over my car. But I don't care, it does a great burnout and can fly by others on the highway. Smiles per gallon is all that matters.

However back to the noise, the noise specifically sounds like a distant hammer because that's what I mistook it for at first, hope that's not a good metaphor for what's actually happening inside the car hammering itself apart 😅. It's sort of soft and happens at an interval of 0.8 seconds. The precise scenario where this occurs is when decelerating to below 15 mph and stopping.

I’m a college student working with my team on a project aimed at helping drivers feel safer and more comfortable when getting gas. Our idea is to create a service where trained staff pump the gas for you so you don’t have to get out of the car.

Right now, we’ve built a simple website that explains the concept, and we’re trying to collect honest feedback before moving forward.

* Would this be something you’d use?
* What concerns would you have (trust, price, convenience)?
* Any suggestions on how to make it more appealing for car owners?

We’re not here to sell anything, just looking for advice from people who drive and care about safety at gas stations. Your input would be super valuable for us as students trying to learn.

Thanks in advance 🙏",1,1759506774.0,3,carquestions,1759606257,2025-10-03 15:52:54,2025-10-04 19:30:57,"Dregan3D (Score: 2): I am old.  Thank you for the reminder.

1nwygqk,My car overheats,"Hi, I bought a 2007 impreza 1.5 years ago for a very cheap price with a faulty engine. I replaced the engine in a garage and made it my car basically. Lately it has been overheating so I took it to a mechanic (not the same guy that replaced the engine as i found out he was lying to me and replaced some parts with faulty ones. Not the engine tk my knowledge). The mechanic said that I have a cracked on one of the engine heads. A really small one. As the repair is quite expensive for me I asked him if I could just use the car until it died and he told me that I can but just keep an eye on the coolent and top it off when needed. Now as long as I don't use the ac the car doesnt really heat up. But the problem is that it's super hot, like 45 degrees Celsius. So I do use the ac but not on full power. My question is, why does it heat when I use the ac and if there is a fix other than replacing the engine or the head?",1,1759496396.0,8,carquestions,1759606257,2025-10-03 12:59:56,2025-10-04 19:30:57,"jg-mtb (Score: 2): Using the ac puts more of a strain on the engine so it heats up more and the cooling system can't keep up. Overheating is one of the fastest ways to blow up an engine. If you are planning to buy a whole new car after this one blows up then drive it till it does but you probably won't have much time. If your plan is to fix this one when it dies then fix it now before it blows up completely.

An oil change removes impurities suspended in the oil, a flush uses solvents to dislodge and remove larger, baked-on contaminants that an oil change can't.

If the oil has been changed on a regular interval such as three or 5000 miles there’s probably no reason to do a flush.

If the oil change service has been spotty and there’s some sludge buildup the best way to handle that is to do an accelerated oil change interval of like 2000 miles to prevent further sludge buildup and get some of the buildup out of the engine quicker."

Pull car outside garage and let udle for 15 minutes while you observe with the hood up.

If it stops smoking after a couple minutes, it's likely someone slopped some oil and no further action is required (buy a funnel maybe).

I feel like this is probably related to the sensor issues but I could be very wrong so if i could have some help from someone who might have an idea it would be greatly appreciated!

I got a warning from my car saying “Warning Icey roads” when it’s not icy at all (could be because I’m getting close to 2C outside) but suddenly my car starting blaring out to check the transmission and was definitely very loud. Once I pulled to the side of the road and turned it off “Engine Heater recommended” it as well says to check engine.

I have all the photos attached above if anyone is needing anything else but I’m hoping that they’re is a reasonable way to fix this? I’ve found an additional forum where someone had the exact issue with my model (even being automatic) hoping people have some other advice as well as it’s been a few years!

jloving1992 (Score: 1): By delayed shift. 

Do you mean it is attempting to shift? Or that it stays in a gear longer. 

A delayed shift, is a shift out of one gear then a delay to enter the next gear. Likely slips in between. Or aggressively shifts after the delay.

If it's staying in gear longer. The vehicle is using programming in the ECM/TCM to delay the shifts to optimally stay in a high torque application. Not all gears are created equal. Gear ratios for each gear are wildly different. For a 5 speed transmission, it's likely 4th gear is used the least. 3rd likely has more torque for acceleration and 5th would be OD and coasting gear. 

I am a Stellantis Transmission technician. So this information is true to our product. But there is also a chance that your certain transmission is hydraulic pressure based on transmission shifts. If that's the case. Fluid condition and filter change interval can change shift points. 

From an engineering standpoint, your concern is the exact reason they are making 8+ speed transmissions. So that the vehicle is always in optimal torque applications. No matter the demand."

If you are driving a manual car it would slow you down less than just lifting your foot off the accelerator (throttle body / carb flaps stay open), then as soon as you drive out the other side you would get oxygen back into the air intake and you would carry on.

If you are just idling, and a cloud drifts over the engine, it would stop quickly, no harm done.

The interesting part is just how much air / halon the engine ingests as it is driven down the road, take a 2 liter engine, driven hard, so 6k rpm, gets through 50 liters of air a second (ignoring reduced flow from throttle not fully open etc, and increased flow from turbo / exhaust scavenging)"

The rattling sound happens, regardless of hitting bumps on the left side of the car or the right side of the car and appears to be louder in the front then in the back. 

Here’s what I’ve done: 

Jacked the car up and visually inspected underneath. Nothing appears to be loose. Smacking every part under the car that I can with a rubber mallet, no rattling. Bushings and boots throughout appear intact.  

Pounded on the wheels and the tires no metallic rattling noise. Did this while jacked and on the ground. 

Visually inspected rotors and brake calipers and brake pads all are properly seated with clips in place. 

Put the car in the driveway stood in the driver side and passenger door frames rocking back-and-forth no rattling noise noted. Suspension seems quiet and within normal limits.

A byproduct of removing pollutants is that the catalytic converter stores oxygen and fuel as it comes in for an additional burn. As a result of this delayed burn of exhaust gasses the downstream oxygen sensor will delay in response to changes in air fuel mixtures reported by the upstream oxygen sensor. 

The previous tech appeared to have reversed these sensors by plugging them in the wrong socket in the wiring harness which is possible on some cars since the sensor plugs are the same. By switching the sensors it will cause the car to run very rich (more fuel) on that bank. By running really rich the exhaust manifolds get really hot and the car will get into a bad loop of dumping more and more fuel until it can’t. I’m sure it was running really bad as result. 

If they’re right in their diagnosis I think it’s a fair statement. Heavy heat cycles and repetitively on an exhaust manifold is going to make it prone to cracking. They can get glowing red in these scenarios. I also think there’s a good chance your catalytic converter received some really bad damage in the process by getting too hot.

It all started when Lane Keep Assist suddenly stopped working.

When I scanned with VCDS, I found both front ABS wheel speed sensors showing:
	Air gap malfunction / Invalid
	Rear sensors are fine (Air gap = 6, valid).

What I’ve done so far:
	Replaced both front ABS sensors with new HELLA 
	Cleared codes and rescanned → same issue, both front sensors still show Air gap malfunction.
	The rear sensors continue to read fine, which makes me think the ABS module is working.
	Lane Change Assist (3C) is also throwing CAN-bus errors because it can’t get proper data from ABS.

Right now:
	•	Sensors (old and new) actually read wheel speed, but the module still flags them as invalid.
	•	LKA are disabled.

What I’m considering:
	The left sensor space was really rusted, maybe I need to clean much better than I did?

If you have an interface of two materials, in this case likely zinc against cast iron or steel, there'll be one coefficient of friction for ""static friction"" meaning how much force do you need to \*start\* the zinc plated part sliding against the iron or steel part per unit normal force (if you envision it as a block sitting on a flat surface, this is the weight of the block.)  However, the coefficient of \*kinetic\* friction is less, meaning it takes less force to keep that block sliding than it does to start it sliding.  Sometimes this effect is called ""stiction"".

The reason this is relevant to torquing fasteners is because you might have a case where you torque a fastener to, say, 50 ft-lbs but the spec is 90 ft-lbs, but if you stop turning it to ratchet or reset or whatever it might take more than 90 ft-lbs to start the fastener turning again and now your fastener is undertorqued.

If you \*do\* have to ratchet or reposition, it's best to do so at low-ish torque levels and try to do the final torque all in one smooth motion for reasons explained above.

Now yes, there are some fasteners e.g. head bolts or similar where you may have a three step torque procedure.  Presumably the engineers who wrote that procedure took these effects into account, so that the steps are far enough apart that you overcome static friction and actually move the fastener before hitting the next step.  Often the bolts are supposed to be oiled or have assembly lube applied as well which tends to reduce the difference between static and kinetic friction.

Circled in blues where the clicking / vibrating noise would come from when turning the key over. 

Circled in red is hoses / connections that aren’t existent lol, jeep never had A/c / hot air which is what I assume some of the hoses are for, but the connection on the top back of the engine idk what is. I assume it ran to the intakes “nipple” I was talking about though.

1nwp4h0,2005 Nissan X-trail Throttle body,"I took my 2005 Nissan X-trail in for a scheduled oil change and to check a recent check engine light. It didn't have any symptoms and was driving as normal. 

When I picked it up the mechanic said they found a decent amount of oil in my throttle body (reason for the code)  but they cleaned it and that was that. However, for some strange reason another technician was out for a test drive when I got there to pick it up even though I had been called over an hour prior saying my car was ready.

He gets back and I get my car. Immediately after starting it up, I notice it's idling irregularly. Continually fluctuating between 1500-2000 rpm until I put it into gear and it steadies out. But putting it into gear is no longer smooth, it's jerky. I brought it back to them and pointed out everything that they pretended not to notice when they gave it back to me and they couldn't/wouldn't offer any explanation or resolve. Instead I was told to just drive it a few days and see if it works itself out. I did and it did not. Now he's saying that I might need a new throttle body

I am a bit frustrated with them giving my car back to me in poor shape without any acknowledgment, I'm just not sure if they are being unscrupulous or not? Could there be a reasonable explanation or did they do me dirty? I am reluctantly scheduled to take it back to them, is that a big mistake?

I parked it for about two weeks and one day I had to move it over to the other side of my driveway and the idle started surging really bad. Checked for codes and P0122 popped up. I cleaned the throttle body and burped the coolant just in case and it threw the engine light. Same code. Tried shifting gears and it wouldn't let me out of park and stayed over 1500 rpm. Figured I had messed something up and bit the bullet and bought a whole new throttle body assembly. I checked the voltage for the TPS and set it to .48v at idle because .5v was causing it to stay in park and the idle dropped to about 1300. Recently had a coworker clear the engine code with his code reader and it dropped more to about 1100. I noticed that when the engine is cold, the RPM ramps up to about 1400 but it wasn't doing that before I parked it. Just about 3 days ago, I found I could try resetting the idle and it now stays at about 1400. I also checked for vacuum leaks and didn't find anything. With the a/c being on, the idle drops to about 900 and gradually goes back up to about 12 to 1300 rpm. I'm ripping my hair out because everything I look up keeps giving me the same solutions, TPS, Idle Relearn, Fast Idle Valve, IACV, and Vacuum Leaks.

Leak stopped car was working, shifting properly, tried a few revs - no problems, CEL light gone. 30 min gone and leak started again, this time it was leaking on IDLE while leak was less like droplets while the car was running.

(Sorry for lengthy explanation but thought I'd include as much as possible as I'm very stressed about this) 

I have a Seat Leon 2.0 TDI 2016 - Recently I had a coolant low message and it reached 100 degrees, I topped up when cool and few days later it kept going down. The garage I usually go to, pointed out that it could be the heater matrix so went ahead with the change and hoped for the best, but sadly coolant is still disappearing... On my next visit the garage performed a head test, to see if there are gases in the coolant expansion tank and it come back positive (it changed from blue to hint of green, but not fully yellow) they advised a head gasket repair is required (quote of 2k with timing belt and water pump) 

My slight annoyance was that perhaps the head test should of been done first before the matrix replaced (which was £700) the garage is sure that the slight blockage of the matrix caused the car to overheat and was the starting point of my head gasket going... 

Is it the right thing to go ahead with the head gasket replacement or do I investigate a different area of the engine that may be causing this?

Also, when the structural damage is internal and no obvious indication of damage from the outer body bar some paintwork, do many people get this fixed in reality?

This is why people are hesitant to buy category write offs (especially S) that have been repaired. You could buy one that's been repaired properly or you could buy one that's just been filled and painted over.

Not only is this a potential risk for the *next* owner/driver but unless you get it professionally inspected then you can't be sure it's not a risk to other people in the event of a crash. There's all sorts of damage that may be internal (whatever that means - I assume it just means it's hidden from view) that has potential to deform or fail in unintended ways in the event of a second accident.

I have about 11 months worth on a cheap runaround, but have just purchased a new car in a much higher insurance bracket, current insurer says they can’t quote me for it so can’t switch cars on that policy. Difference between 0 NC and 1 year NC is a few hundred when comparing insurance policies for the new car. 

I’m thinking get an insurance policy for the new car with 0 NC, then cancel it after a month, pay the what looks like £60 ish fee, and reinsure with 1 year NCD. Saving money but also continuing my NCD. 

Is this OK and the best approach? Also if I do go this route can I pre purchase my insurance that starts in a month to potentially get a better rate or is that’s going to flag up somewhere.

Budget can go up to £75k but naturally I’m happy to pay less and to buy used up to 2 years old.

This car will be used primarily for us in social use but that business purpose is a relevant factor. 

We are also possibly biased towards Range Rover as we have owned 2 now for the last 10 years with the 2019 owning since new, and we’ve never visited a dealer for anything (knock on wood), and have generally had a very good experience. Additionally, the interiors are nice and wear very well.

Having said that I’d like to move us into something with a more competitive drivetrain and I’m conscious that other manufacturers possibly have more compelling alternatives that are electric or PHEV, but I’m not certain which ones really stack up or come close to the RR experience for the rest of the car and build quality.

It has been into the closest Evans Halshaw Vauxhall to me 4 times, for this one issue. The first 2 were diagnosis’, where they told me to “use a good wire” (suggesting a CarPlay issue). The last time, they said it’s a ‘known fault’ so they replaced a suppressor kit, gps antenna, and something else I didn’t understand. After 2 weeks of them having it, they ‘repaired’ it, it seemed to work, so I went on my way. Same day, probably 3 hours later, it faulted. This faulty work cost my warranty company nearly £1200.

I contacted them via email to complain, and they asked me to bring my car in for diagnosis again. I expressed concern about the cost, and they said the diagnosis would be free of charge. 

I’ve been in contact with them daily, as I’m eager to get my car back. They’ve said things still need looking at, they need to contact Vauxhall to see if it’s an issue with the radio, etc. I have expressed wanting my car back as soon as the diagnosis is done, so I can make a decision on any work that needs completing, but I don’t know if that’s possible. 


I don’t know what to do. Any work I need to pay for isn’t likely to be covered by my warranty, given the hefty cost of the last one. I just don’t feel like the work they do now isn’t up to me, but I don’t know. Should I be paying for it? Do I have any kind of legal standing?

TLDR; Evans halshaw Vauxhall diagnosed a navigation issue wrong twice, “fixed” the issue then it failed immediately, now are diagnosing the same issue. Should I be paying for any work they do now?

Usually work done for repairs has its own warranty, any replacement parts or bad workmanship should be covered for some period certainly exceeding 3 hours so as long as you reported it to them promptly it should be on the garage to fix it - unless it's something different to the work they did, in which case back to the warranty company for another claim.

1nwl7w7,Help with a car,I plan to buy a car. Ive driven for almost 4 years and turn 22 in October. My budget is £6000. I'll be doing around 10-12000 miles a year. I use my car to commute to university daily around 3 hours to get there and back. I need something nice to drive and reliable preferably automatic. Any ideas of cars I should consider?

Cheap to run and very reliable, just avoid cars with mentions of corrosion on the MOT history.

Looking at temp insurance for a day set to start the day before, my question is, can I tax the vehicle before the insurance policy actually starts when I buy it in advance?

Or they may start your new policy at midday and cover old car till then giving you time to go to the dealer

RhubarbASP (Score: 1): Tax it online when you pick the new car up from the dealer. Then do day insurance before you drive off, or set up the insurance to start that day. Insurance runs from midnight to midnight so there is usually a small over lap if you intend to switch insurance. If you are not, might be cheaper to change car with your current insurers.
