1ovkh1p,How do I fix a clunking sound that I think is from a sway bar,"First, the obvious source of a clunking sway bar is a problem with the sway bar links. I'm pretty sure this is not the problem.

This for a 2013 Honda Odyssey

The front passenger sway bar link was not properly attached and this caused a lot of clunking that I ignored for several months. Then I took the car to the dealership. They found the unattached sway bar link, which ended up getting damaged because it hadn't been properly attached for a long time, and they replaced both front sway bar links. For those who are curious, the sway bar link was not properly attached because I messed up and didn't properly refasten it after I replaced the front passenger CV axle, but that is a separate story.

The car was fine for a while, but it is now making clunking sounds again, not as bad as before, but it's clunking. I inspected both front sway bar links, and they are securely fastened and they seem to be in good condition. They are only a few months old.

I removed the front passenger wheel, disconnected the tie rod end from the steering knuckle. I moved the knuckle back and forth with my hands. When I move the knuckle, there is a pop or clunk; and when I put my hand on the sway bar, I can feel the sway bar jolting when the cluck happens.

So if it isn't the links, then how do I make the snapping/clunking go away? Did the sway bar, or it's supports get damaged during the months that I didn't have a properly connected sway bar link? Or does anyone think that I am wrong, and it really is the sway bar links?",1,1762988407.0,4,MechanicAdvice,1763062547,2025-11-12 23:00:07,2025-11-13 19:35:47,"kyden (Score: 1): Check the sway bar bushings.

That was fixed but I still noticed the clicking.  Again,  only when making sharp turns at slow speeds.  Nothing weird when on the highway or faster turns.  

I've driven my Equinox for 2 years with that clicking but it's only used to drive to work 3 times a week.  A tank of gas lasts me a month. I've had multiple oil changes where they do ""inspections"" where the cv joint and other suspension components are marked as good. 

I finally got fed up with the clicking and turned my wheels to inspect the cv joints and axles and they don't appear ripped or anything,  but noticed the grease build up by the passenger control arm in this picture.  It is not like that on the driver side.

The way to check it is to jack up that tire BY THE JOINT, until the front tire is about 2"" off the ground.  Take a sturdy prying utility (prybar, 2x4, etc etc that is at least 36"" long) and pry the wheel up.  Watch that joint.  If it moves AT ALL, it's bad.

Over the past 2 weeks my car stutters on start up and the revs drop. It says running but the first time I idle (to turn out of my road usually), the car will switch off. Radio, lights etc still on. Doesn't feel like it stalls, just isn't on. Gear changes feel effortful for the first 5 minutes of the drive and then everything is fine, no issues. Sometimes the revs drop when I'm idling, and it can be quite rough, but it doesn't turn off again throughout the drive (long or short). I've taken it to two mechanics, both have said there isn't anything they can find and their diagnostic machines aren't throwing up a fault code.

Last Friday I test-drove the car and really liked it. The salesperson (Issac) said there was a knocking sound when the heat was on — supposedly just the blower fan — and promised it would be fixed that same day.
Then the delays started.
Monday: He said the repair still wasn’t done.
Tuesday: He told me they had to send it to Dodge because it wasn’t actually the blower fan after all.
Wednesday: I was told the car was finally ready, and we set a 3 p.m. pickup time. I even left work early and was on my way when he called to say the ABS light came on, so I couldn’t take the car.
Now it’s been almost a week, and the car’s still at Dodge. He keeps saying he won’t deliver it until the light is fixed (which I appreciate), but between the multiple overlooked issues and poor communication, I’m starting to worry about the car’s overall quality. Especially since he originally bragged that Hyundai “doesn’t put anything on the lot that isn’t quality.”
I still want this exact car — it’s under my budget and fits what I need — but at this point I’m thinking about:
Asking for a pre-purchase inspection at my own mechanic before signing anything.

I’m planning to do my first oil change myself on my 2017 Toyota Camry LE (2.5L 4-cyl). I drive around 1,000 miles a month just for daily commuting, and I also do DoorDash on top of that, so my total mileage adds up pretty fast.

Also wondering what oil change interval (OCI) I should follow — every 5,000 mi or can I safely stretch to 7,500 mi since most of my miles are highway and steady-speed driving?

In the interest of discussion...

Generally speaking most manufacturers of body-on-frame vehicles will supply the basic frame plus cab (usually the short version) to builders of ""specialty"" vehicles. Toyota has long sold the Hilux frame + shortcab (generally with various I4 diesel engines) for the purpose: it's the up to the builder to have the resulting vehicle homologated for road use according to local legislation on the matter. Ironically enough these Hilux conversions are in high demand in some African countries as they get stripped of whatever special equipment they have and converted to the standard pickup truck configuration. Local legislation is far more forgiving than ours on the matter.

Compression test was done the next morning at a mechanic with the following results: 130psi, 80psi, 100psi, 140psi, 115psi, 120psi

At this point the shop recommended a cylinder head job or replacing the engine. **Is there any need to question the accuracy of those readings and getting it checked again by someone else before moving forward?**

My understanding is that any of the potential causes, repairs, or replacements would involve tearing down the engine, bringing labor costs up to roughly the same ballpark price. For this reason, even if we had a better understanding of the culprit via a leak down test, all of the repairs would still be in the 3-5k ballpark. Is that a correct train of thought?

JDM replacement and install would be about $3,500.",1,1762961153.0,5,MechanicAdvice,1763062547,2025-11-12 15:25:53,2025-11-13 19:35:47,"Protholl (Score: 1): Ohh... 80psi that's not good.  I'd show those numbers to a different mechanic for a second opinion.

RudbeckiaIS (Score: 1): Those are extremely low numbers on all cylinders: you are looking at over 1.000kPa (around 150 psi) for a minimal reading. 

My gut feeling would be to recheck compression, but unfortunately these GR engines have proven to be much less rugged and durable than their MZ predecessors. Yes, I am eating downvotes here. In the specific the water pump on those engines (hybrids excluded, those have a far more reliable electric pump) is a wear item and should always be replaced at around 100.000km (OE; aftermarket lasts much less) because it has a disconcerting habit of failing suddenly and without any warning and cause exactly what you saw. Namely blown head gaskets on both banks and possibly warped heads as well. 

This is a cheapish cost of labor country and Toyota parts cost a fortune, so here my advise would be to replace the head gaskets, check the heads and eventually have them true'd, replace water pump then test the cooling system to see if the coolant temperature sensor needs replacement. In an expensive country engine replacement is probably more convenient since you cut off the cost of head gasket replacement and eventual head work and parts are likely not as expensive as they are here."

1ovhkpl,"First-time buyer — dealership delays and new issues popping up before I can even pick up the car (2013 Dodge Avenger SXT, 60k miles, ~$9k total","I’m in the process of buying a 2013 Dodge Avenger SXT (or STX, depending on the trim) with about 60,000 miles on it for around $9,000 total from Northtown Hyundai.

Last Friday I test-drove the car and really liked it. The salesperson (Issac) said there was a knocking sound when the heat was on — supposedly just the blower fan — and promised it would be fixed that same day.
Then the delays started.

Monday: He said the repair still wasn’t done.
Tuesday: He told me they had to send it to Dodge because it wasn’t actually the blower fan after all.
Wednesday: I was told the car was finally ready, and we set a 3 p.m. pickup time. I even left work early and was on my way when he called to say the ABS light came on, so I couldn’t take the car.

Now it’s been almost a week, and the car’s still at Dodge. He keeps saying he won’t deliver it until the light is fixed (which I appreciate), but between the multiple overlooked issues and poor communication, I’m starting to worry about the car’s overall quality. Especially since he originally bragged that Hyundai “doesn’t put anything on the lot that isn’t quality.”
I still want this exact car — it’s under my budget and fits what I need — but at this point I’m thinking about:

Asking for a pre-purchase inspection at my own mechanic before signing anything.
Requesting some kind of price adjustment (maybe a few hundred off) for the delays and missed work time.

Is this reasonable? Should I still move forward with this car if they fix everything, or is this a sign to walk away?",1,1762981762.0,11,carquestions,1763062547,2025-11-12 21:09:22,2025-11-13 19:35:47,"azgli (Score: 6): Walk away. It's a Dodge and these are just the start of the issues.

First off thank you for taking the time to read my post. 

Need advice on 3 things:

1. Can I fix this issue by myself? If so, how?
2. If I can’t fix this by myself, how much should this cost to fix? Just wanna make sure I’m not getting scalped. 
3. I have a SF trip coming up (in 1 week) where I’ll be driving from Los Angeles. Is it okay to drive with this issue? Should I get it fixed right away? 

Context: I drive a Honda Civic Sport 2019, it all started with “Electric Parking Brake Problem” where I couldn’t engage/disengage the emergency break so I couldn’t drive it. Had Triple A tow it and took it to a Triple A certified auto shop (which Triple A suggested instead of taking it to Honda). They fixed the parking brake problem along with replacing my old battery that was apparently dying with a new one. And that’s how the issue with the warning lights happen (see video). My dad took care of all this since I was busy at work. 

Just want a better understanding of what even is going on. 

Thank you again for reading my post and hope you could help me out with this issue as I’m not the biggest car person.

With a new battery or a bad one will activate several MIL on the dash and when they tried to calibrate the steering angle sensor they might enter on the ADAS calibration and for this you will need special equipment for these sensors. 

Long story short, you'll be to take it to a Honda dealer or any shop that does ADAS calibrations... usually a 4 to 5 hour job. There are some videos on YouTube that might make you think you you can do it, but believe me the machine cost around $40k.

I'll also be putting on a ton of mileage starting Monday as I'm on call and can easily put between 400-700 miles on it. The VSC has a $1000 deductible for the first 3 months and $250 afterwards, up to $10k in repairs. Engines/transmission/rebuild are $500 deductible. And it comes with roadside assistance and rental coverage as well.

1outcew,Looking for a Kind Soul to Assist Me Out of a Tough Spot with My 2020 model 3 Tesla,"Hi everyone,

I’m reaching out in hopes of finding someone in the community who might be willing to help me out of a really difficult situation.

A few years back, when gas prices were soaring and everyone was talking about electric vehicles, I ended up buying a 2020 Tesla Model 3. At the time, I’d only ever leased cars, which worked well for me because I liked the flexibility and the lower payments. But Tesla didn’t offer leasing at that point, so I bought it outright.

Fast forward to now, and I’m in a tough financial bind. Due to some unforeseen medical expenses and being out of work for a while, I ended up in debt and really struggling. Now I owe about $30,000 on the car, but the trade-in value is only around $15,000 to $18,000, which means I can’t roll it into a lease or trade it in without paying a huge amount out of pocket—money I just don’t have right now.

I’m hoping to find someone who might be interested in buying the car at a price that could help me get out of this hole. It’s a good car, just a base model 2020 Tesla Model 3 with no frills, but it’s been reliable for me. 67,343 miles, still under warranty for the battery.

If you or anyone you know is in a position to help, or if you have any advice on where else I could share this, I’d be incredibly grateful. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and for any kindness you can offer.

1ovcpf0,What do I do here? Please help! Would love some advice! 2012 Toyota Prous,"I had my car inspected by an independent shop, then by a dealership. I don't know what to do..... Whether I should try to sell it, repair it, drive it as I search for a new car, trade it in, etc. 
I do a good bit of driving as a mental health worker as I drive clients on errands and for appointments. A car is a requirement for my job. Please help me out with some tips or guidance. 


Here's a (modified) email/writeup I gave the dealership:

I recently had my vehicle inspected by a third-party shop; my friends who have worked at this and other Toyota dealerships advised me to have it inspected at a dealership as I was overcharged at my recent third-party inspection, plus they lost my initial email so they'd inspected the issues based off of what I could remember ([independent shop]AKA TMS). My friends swear by dealerships; I'm just concerned about pricing as I've been steered away from other peers. I want a few areas of concern of my car checked out, but overall, I'm looking to do a general inspection, establish a baseline/relationship with the dealership, and maybe get some quotes on what may need work. I'm trying to prepare for safe winter driving and want this car to last as all Toyotas should.

Contextual history:
-The previous owner had high-mileage tires on the car and used it for inter-state travel. They did regular oil changes with high-mileage synthetic. The owner before them had used it on a farm of some sort.
-The previous owner stated that when backing out of his, there'd be a loud sound. His mechanic found it to be the steering column and replaced it shortly before selling off the car to me.

Current notes:
1) When going over bumps, my car makes clunking noise consistently. There is a particular large bump in the road on Larpenteur that seems to bottom out my suspension as it throws me quite hard with a loud bang. I have since taken it slow with hazards over the bump.
    1a) I had my front left strut replaced by a third party no-name mechanic as it'd been failing. It has since loosened from vibration; I had him tighten it once about a week after installation and haven't been back. It still sounds like it wobbles on uneven roads and will floor out on overly aggressive bumps. (may also be somewhat related to my tie rods and/or end)
2) TMS stated the front outer tie rods and/or ends will need service. Notes I took are; loose in front, safe currently but service soon, would be first up to service.
3) An ignition coil has failed in the past; it led to a piston misfiring and white smoke coming out of my exhaust. I had it serviced at [independent shop] but have since stopped going there after a familial member had a really bad experience there. I don't think they replaced any other plugs or coils, but I could be mistaken.
    3a) T.M.S. took a look at them without full disassembly for inspection. Notes I have on it are service soon, mileage-wise, 3 coil packs not replaced, visible cracks atop coil pack, and likely second up to service.
        3b) I occasionally/rarely get a ""rotten egg"" smell briefly in my cabin. It happened more frequently before the ignition coil failure. I think it's been rearing it's head again on rare occasion, but it's hard to tell what's my car vs what's coming from the environment around me.
4) There is a constant hum while driving, it's most noticeable on ≥moderate speeds on smooth roads. 
    4a) My friend is worried it may be the transmission. TMS stated it's the rear wheel bearings, but that they're still tight/safe at the moment.
5)When steering there is a clicking noise and feel in the steering wheel.
    5a) TMS stated that the clicking feels to be the shaft but would need disassembly to fully inspect. No concerns were stated.
6) The engine tends to have a rougher start in the cold, slight knocking, however it's inconsistent and goes away.
    6a) I suspect the spark plugs or ignition coils but would like my battery tested as well.
7) The car feels like it pulls slightly to the right, that's been present since purchase (not a main concern, may be related to the tie rods/ends).

If you get the wrong cat and it’s the primary one you are replacing, then you will get a check engine light on. Which would fail state inspection.

If you're in a country that doesn't do full on emissions testing, you can get away with a $100-200 catalytic converter off eBay and have an exhaust shop weld it in for another $100-200 cash. 

If you're somewhere that does tail pipe tests, the cheap catalytic converters often will fail those tests. Usually meaning you have to buy a proper cat converter that can be $500-2000 depending on the vehicle. Sometimes it's cheaper to buy the whole bolt on section rather than welding in a replacement.

1ouqadq,"2004 Honda Civic SI (1.7L VTEC) – Weird cooling issue: used to overheat, now won’t heat up at all","Hey everyone, looking for some help diagnosing a confusing cooling issue on my 2004 Honda Civic SI (Canadian version, 1.7L SOHC VTEC).

About two years ago my heat basically stopped working properly in the winter — it would only blow warm if I revved the engine, was on the highway, or randomly at times. Around a year ago I was doing some hih revving winter drifting and my temp gauge suddenly shot to max. I immediately pulled over and shut the car off, so I don’t think the engine actually overheated, but coolant was coming out of the overflow.

Ever since then, my car’s been overheating on and off. The temp gauge would spike up, then drop back down randomly. It kept getting worse over time. I replaced the thermostat back then but it didn’t seem to help. I’ve been driving it like that for about a year — whenever the gauge spikes, I can usually drop a gear and rev it for a few seconds and the temp will fall back down. Sometimes (especially in winter) it actually overheats and I have to pull over for 10 minutes or so.

Recently though, it’s flipped — now it *underheats*. It would go from running temp then drop about 50F randomly, and not go back up for a while. So I checked the coolant and found the radiator basically bone dry, though the overflow tank was between mid and max. I added around 2.5–3.5 liters of coolant. Ever since, the heat inside works great (blows hot within a minute or two), but the engine itself never gets to operating temp — it just sits around 138–148°F.

Both radiator hoses feel only slightly warm even after 20 minutes of idling. It’s so faint it could just be residual engine bay heat.

**What I’m wondering:**

* Could this be a stuck-open thermostat even though I replaced it?
* Or maybe a bad water pump / air pocket / blown head gasket issue that’s progressed over time?
* Why would it go from *overheating randomly* to *never heating up at all*?

Any advice or step-by-step troubleshooting tips would be super appreciated — I’m comfortable doing basic work myself.

1ovazac,What's the smallest air impact wrench/driver you know of,"So, after I did a water pump and thermostat job on a 2007 Saturn Ion-2 2.2, I was wondering how easier it would have been with one of those ""compact"" ones. This job was probably the most difficult one I've done so far as a DIYer. I spent maybe 36 hours nonstop. Honestly, a lot of time went to researching things like things like ""can I use aluminum putty to piece back together the plastic part of a coolant temperature sensor?"" Or ""how the hell am I supposed to reach these three bolts I can't even see!?"" amongst other stuff, but the tight spaces I had to deal with made me wanna cry blood tears and drink them 😭 

I have to go back in there because I reused a gasket on the thermostat housing looks to be rectangular but the one that comes with gasket kit I used is circular and was supposed to be the replacement but since it wasn't rectangular I assumed I had to purchase that gasket separately. I found out later that this wasn't the case, and I should have used that gasket. Also, I have to replace the sensor I broke. I mean, everything seems to be good. No leaks, and the sensor seems to be working and ok from what's showing on the dash and on my scanner tool app. Would you leave it be?

So, is there a super small air impact driver available. I've never owned one, so I can't give dimensions or an example. What's the smallest you guys ever used or know of

Thanks

Is the temp needle hardly registering on the gauge? The problem is you have a rusted open thermostat, which just allows coolant to flow straight to the radiator on start up.
The thermostat should remain closed while the car engine heats up the coolant in the engine galleries. Then when it reaches 180f (about 82c) the thermostat opens, allowing coolant to flow through the radiator and then back to the engine. This all works as long as your water pump is turning and not leaking, which I assume it's good. So change your thermostat and possibly drain and refill the coolant if it's been longer than 3 yrs"

* Nissan Pathfinder
* 4x4

I have recently (1 month old) received a replacement vehicle which I have zero intention of keeping - I would like to sell this ASAP as I already had to buy a new car. My issue is that when taking photos in preparation to sell, I noticed rust underneath the vehicle on the...

* Subframe mounting points
* Bolt heads & washers
* Suspension bush housings
* Exhaust system - in particular the metal hanger (?) and various welded points.  

\*\* There is a strong chance the parts named were not the actual correct parts... just hoping I am kinda close... 

I am also confused as to why there are dings in the muffler, are these normal? 

I have asked the dealership and was advised that it is surface rust however, however due to previous issues (hence now receiving a replacement vehicle) I have little faith in the information provided by the dealership.

It feels unethical selling this to a family (or... anyone really) without doing all I can to make sure there are no issues when sold to them. 

Sorry in advance - about my terrible photography skills

About a week later we noticed grinding/whirring in the front wheels which was completely new. We brought the car back to the service center and they’re now saying both front wheel bearings are faulty and require replacement. They say it had nothing to do with prior service. 

They’re quoting $1800 for the job.

Could the sudden faulty wheel bearings have been caused by a mishandled realignment or rotation? 

We’ll definitely take it someplace else to get fixed but it just seems suspicious.

I have to go back in there because I reused a gasket on the thermostat housing looks to be rectangular but the one that comes with gasket kit I used is circular and was supposed to be the replacement but since it wasn't rectangular I assumed I had to purchase that gasket separately. I found out later that this wasn't the case, and I should have used that gasket. Also, I have to replace the sensor I broke. I mean, everything seems to be good.

Motor has 178k on it and seems like every weekend I'm working on it, Which I love to do, as a hobby, Not out of necessity.

I want to make the truck more reliable, I just don't know how. I've done compression tests on all cylinders and they're all around 155-165. Oil pressure is good on start up but once warm we sit around 12psi. Which from what I read is fine by manufacturer standards but definitely teetering on being an issue.

Pressure sensor changed out, oil changes done regularly, haven't checked tolerances yet but I'm guessing the motor is getting worn out.

I've been reading about the ls3 swaps that seem very popular I'm just not sure if it's overkill for what I use the truck for which is daily driving/camping/road trips.

What are some options? Is it worth having a shop check it over first to tell me if I should rebuild it? Should I just get another 350 crate motor? Ls swap?

They said there isn't much we can do besides replace the transmission. But that is more money that I bought the car for a year and a 1/2 ago. He seemed not super worried saying it's so early on its hard to notice and no codes have been thrown yet. Also that it could fuck the transmission fast or be like that for a very long time.

1our9cn,Help! Intermittent AC Issue,"Hi everyone! I'm making this post out of desperation as I've been dealing with an AC issue in my car in South Florida for a year and a half and I'm totally at my breaking point. Any ideas of what the problem could possibly be would be greatly appreciated!!

I have a 2016 Mini Cooper S (F56) with a B48 engine and an intermittent AC issue that does not throw any codes. The problem started not long after I bought it. The AC randomly cuts out to the point where I can spend most, if not all of my drive without cold air. However, when it works, it's absolutely ice cold and blows strong.

It cuts out unpredictably and doesn't seem to be affected by outside temperature. I used to think it happened more on hotter days but I think I just notice it more on those days because it definitely cuts out on cooler days as well.

I have a Launch diagnostic tablet and have noticed that the compressor clutch reads as engaged when working, and disengaged when not working.  The pressures are all within normal range for operating and not operating respectively. This is alongside hearing the clutch engage/disengage when the tablet readings change.  

The accurate readings, in combination with no codes leads me to believe something may be commanding the compressor to turn off when it shouldn't be. 

I have also noticed that when my AC cuts out, the fan speed sometimes reduces but not always. I can press the max AC button and it will blow full strength, just not cold.

Here is what I have done/replaced so far:

- All fuses checked
- AC lines have been flushed and recharged to the correct pressures multiple times
- Replaced integrated supply control module
- Replaced blower motor resistor
- Replaced blend door actuators
- Replaced compressor
- Replaced IHKA module (however, this was not coded to my vehicle so I cleared the fault on my tablet every time I started the car but the issue persisted; not sure if the frequency of cutting out changed)

I've taken it to three different shops to no avail. Most recently, a BMW tuning shop told me they think it's the hard-coded freezing temp for the evap condenser, and that the system it's attempting to thaw. They said that it's a common issue on F-Series BMWs (2008-2018) but they haven't seen it on F-Series Mini's (2014-2024). They said the fix is to program the freezing temp to a lower temperature. 

I'm not confident that this is the issue though, because my AC more often than not doesn't work upon starting my car (or even 10+ minutes afterwards), even if it has been sitting all day. It turning off and turning back on is completely random as far as I can tell.

I love this car and would love to continue to drive it but I also don't want to keep pouring money into a solutionless problem and I feel like I'm at a dead end.

If it’s active cruise control, in which the car maintains speed based upon the cars in front, generally yes.

If you’re reducing speed by clicking it down manually by X mph, it depends on how fast the deceleration is.  If the car can’t slow down with engine braking alone, it might put brake (and therefore lights) on.  If you’re dropping, say, 70-68mph, it’ll just reduce throttle.

Slight-Message-7331 (Score: 16): I would also add, if it’s an EV with regenerative braking, the car will be programmed to turn the brake lights on if the deceleration is above a certain rate even without touching the brake pedal.  

That applies to normal driving and cruise control.  If you are just manually reducing the target speed, then no, the deceleration rate wont be high enough to engage regenerative braking and activate the lights, however if it is active cruise control and it is responding to a vehicle in front, then yes, the brake lights will come on.

I can’t say this is exactly the same for every EV, but it’s how my 2 month old one works and I understand this is fairly typical.

1ovifzn,Hyundai Kona Premium Service History - Advice,"Hi,

We're purchasing a Hyundai Approved used car registered on 8 September 2022 and has about 27k mileage. It has the following service history:

22/10/2023 -- 1year @12401 miles
30/10/2024 -- 2year@22038 miles 
31/10/2025 -- 3year@27000 miles

MOT has no advisories.

Hyundai does have a grace period of 30days and 1000miles on service schedule as I confirmed from Hyundai customer care. Additionally my Hyundai dealership mentioned that after every service, the next date and miles are calculated from the service date.

So with the above service schedule, it appears that the service from 2nd year onwards is as per Hyundai schedule (considering the latest service date and miles). And the warranty would be void only if they can traceback the issue to the additional miles on the first service.

Given this info, is this a good enough bet to take? As in, can I still expect to rely on the remaining 5 year warranty and the 8 year battery warranty?

This is a Kona Premium 64kwh and priced around 15k. I have looked at another approved used car at another dealer as well, which has a similar price and mileage and which also has small service schedule deviance i.e. it was serviced 2 months over the 1 year period, which makes me think this is a common issue.

So the car (Corolla estate) was a demonstrator from Toyota. Registered June 2024. I bought it start of November 2024 with around 3k on the clock. Wipers were fine. 

Around January / February this year the drivers side wiper started to smear on the downward sweep. I went to Toyota and they sold me a cheaper set of wipers. They had two versions available - Optifit branded ones for about £40 - or ones the same as the factory fit for £80. I was assured the cheaper ones were fine. 

The optifit were sh*t. They cleared the screen okay in the middle but both ends of the drivers side didn’t contact the screen properly and left unswept areas at the top and bottom of the blade. 

I then found out the factory fit ones that Toyota wanted £80 for are actually Denso hybrid wipers - available much cheaper than Toyota from Euro Car Parts. So after maybe 3 months I replaced the poorly fitting Optifit wipers in May this year. 

The last couple of months the drivers side wiper had started to smear on the downward stroke again, the same as the original set. 

I’m big into car detailing and have tried decontaminating the windscreen, applying a fresh glass sealant, cleaned the blades with glass cleaner etc… nothing made a difference. I turn the auto wipers off when not needed so it’s not like they’ve been worn out by over wiping a dry windscreen or anything. I’ve never had an issue with wiper lifespan or smearing on any of my many previous cars. And my detailing product selection hasn’t changed with this car so I’m confident it’s not an issue caused by a detailing product. 

After driving home to Teesside from Leeds in the dark and rain tonight I was so infuriated by the smeary wiper I’ve been to Halfords and picked up a set of Bosch Aero wipers. 

Back to having a flawless wipe with much improved visibility when driving on the motorway at night.

You can also check the mot history to have an idea of how it's been looked after , I wouldn't necessarily worry if it's failed a few MOTs in the past but if there's a recent mot with mention of corrosion then I'd avoid.

1ov9lyv,New clutch rev hang,"

For a bit of context I brought my car (vauxhall corsa 1.2 2013) in March of this year. Since buying I never had any form of rev hang, the revs seemingly dropped instantly. The other week my clutch went and so I had it replaced. The first day after getting it there was no issue no rev hang etc. The next day and ever since when I press the clutch in it holds the revs for a second or so. 

After looking into it, it seems it could be part of the car. However moving off and going 1st gear to 2nd is a pain in the ass due to the revs not dropping quick enough which results in a jolt when u re-engage the clutch. 

Is this normal? Does the clutch just need 'bedding in? Does the ecu need to 'relearn'?

The trade in value of the car is around £1500 and market value around £3800 but I was thinking it would make more sense to not spend £10,000 plus on a new car in order to save £2000. It’s also been very reliable mechanically and I like driving it. As I can’t even get a quote, it looks like I may have to.

The other issue is I’m now working from home so hardly use the car; I did less than 2000 miles last year so I’m not sure if it’s worth spending too much on a new one. I was looking at the Mazda CX5 (post 2017) and similar cars but they seem to range from between 15-25k used.

If you were me, would you:

Keep the car for another year and the scrap it when it fails its MOT.

Trade it in, replace it with a car of a similar value but risk higher repair bills (money saved from buying a more expensive one may make up for this but I do want a reliable car)

Trade it in, replace it with a 2-3 old used car that will cost a lot more, be more reliable, but won’t do many miles.

I don’t want to sell it privately.

I've narrowed it down to this car but I don't know what would be better. The older Petrol Takuya (like 2010-12) or the newer diesel 2.2 (2012-15). Those years seem to suit my budget as well.

Do all the panels line up? Are the gaps between the panels the same on both sides? Does anything look out of line or the paint looks a bit off?

Check the interior. If the car has done 40,000 miles but the gearknob and steering wheel are worn and peeling, exercise caution. 

Check MOT history and service history. Look through the wheels to see if you can see the thickness of the brake pads and condition of discs.

get underneath it and look for any fluid leaks.

Don't look at a car or buy one which has recently been driven. You want to hear it start up from cold, and start it up with the door/window open so you get a good listen to the engine. Any squeaks, rattles or metallic sounds, avoid. 

Even check tyre brands. If it has 4x fairly new Michelin or Pirelli tyres on, it indicates the owner is happy to spend money. If it has 4x SingSongSunnerXL or something on it, it tells you they like to save money on everything possible and could be an indicator of cost saving/corner cutting when it comes to paying out.

Also, if buying privately FOR THE LOVE OF GOD do background checks.

People quote HPI, but VCheck is better. It's cheaper and will also cover things HPI doesnt such as salvage auctions, previous taxi, police vehicle etc.

1ouzru3,Best cheap EV car.,"At the moment I have a petrol focus, things are starting to go wrong with it, so have decided to sell and buy a cheap EV (or as cheap as EVs go).

I don't do many miles (to and from work 4 times a week, 10 miles there and back) and barely drive my car outside of those times. I have children, but use the big family car to drive them around. The boot would need to be big enough for a fold up pram.

I really don't care for makes, status symbols etc. All I care about is reliability and value for money. Does anyone have any recommendations?

1ouzm6v,Car failed MOT after paying for repairs,"I got an MOT done on my car 2 weeks ago and it failed. I got repairs done on the car at a different garage and then had to rebook another MOT at a different center due to waiting times. 
This was yesterday and even after getting the repairs done, the new center failed my car on the things I supposedly got repairs on, plus something new.
I’m just wondering if anyone has any advice on what exactly my options are here with the garage that done the repairs. I went back to them yesterday and they were not happy and confused as they said they definitely did the repairs but will take another look at it.

Do i have legal ground to just ask for a full refund? I’m scared that if they claim to fix it again it’s just gonna fail again and it’s becoming a money sink.

I didn’t want to have to use different places but due to availability I didn’t have a choice


More info:
Sorry i really am clueless with cars.

It originally failed on 
-‘Track rod end ball joint excessive play near front’ 
- ‘suspension arm ball joint dust cover no longer prevents the ingress of dirt offside front (split) 

The garage couldn’t do repairs on it for a couple weeks so i had to take it to another garage. This garage doesn’t do MOT, so after they claimed they fixed the MOT repairs, I took it to another garage that doesn’t do MOTS.
This garage then failed it again on:
- ‘Track rod end ball joint dust cover insecure so that it no longer prevents the ingress of dirt near side front.
-‘Macpherson strut top bush or bearing has excessive wear or free play offside front’
- ‘Steering locking device missing nearside front (track rod end nut locking pin missing)

This is the first MOT i’ve had to do since passing, so wasn’t aware that it was best just to get all the repairs and everything done at the same place ",5,1762935448.0,20,CartalkUK,1763062547,2025-11-12 08:17:28,2025-11-13 19:35:47,"BenisDDD69 (Score: 20): Firstly, what was failed on the first MOT?

1outbum,Insurance tips for new drivers,"Obviously we all see a lot of people complain about the prices of car insurance, as a relatively new driver im going to give my own tips on how you can get lower quotes on insurance. (I recommend to use Compare the Market. I found the quotes cheaper than other insurance comparison websites like MoneySuperMarket)

I'm 19, but i got my first car when I was 18 roughly 7 months after passing my test, I drive a 1.4L Peugeot 207 which I paid £1100 on insurance with no blackbox. (£800 without a blackbox). 

Firsty, if you're able too add your mother and father to your insurance, this is the greatest determinator on what price you'll get on insurance. If you cannot add your mother or father onto your insurance see if you can get another experinced family member added onto your insurance. 

Secondly, if you don't have a car yet look for a car between 1-1.6L which isn't super popular with new drivers. Corsas and Fiestas are expensive on insurance for new drivers due to how many new drivers have them. Look for cars which ain't super popular with new drivers. Toyota Auris, Volvo C30 are great to look at! 

Thirdly, if you're able too and ain't too worried about having a car yet, get secondary insurance on a family members car. I had secondary insurance on my stepdads car for a couple of months after passing my test. I found this also helped to decrease insurance when I clicked this option. 

Fourthly, how many miles will you realistically drive? Many people put too much milage and deoending on how many miles you'll realistically do you could save money. This can always be increased on a later date if you use up the milage. 

5th tip, what industry do you work at? What job you do technically could be classed as multiple things. Have a little look but make sure you don't lie. 

6th tip, make sure you use a temporary email (search up 10 minute mail) and use a search engine like DuckDuckGo for every new quote. Yes this does seem like a lot of time but using the same email every single time actually increases the price you get due to cookies and other data collection things (i dont really understand myself) but this really does work. 

These are my personal tips for insurance, I do also live in an area which already has cheaper car insurance prices than many areas (South Wales, random town in the valleys) But I was able to save hundreds on my original insurance quote using these tips. Just make sure you don't lie. 

I hope this helps, car insurance is already expensive enough and incredibly unfair on new drivers.",3,1762914865.0,8,CartalkUK,1763062547,2025-11-12 02:34:25,2025-11-13 19:35:47,"sneekeruk (Score: 2): It depends on the age of parents.

Looking to buy a E93 M3 for under £15,000, looking for a Blue or Silver car with EDC, Comfort access and generally a good spec 

I've narrowed it down to these 2, a 80 odd thousand mile car for 15,000 or a 120,000 mile car for £12,500 


With it being a delicate M3 (V8 and Convertible) is it worth getting the higher milage but 3 year newer car or the lower miles 59 plate car 

From my investigations the 59 plate has been passed around with about 7 owners with the last one blacking out the rims and adding some tacky mods 

Not sure about the 12 plate history but seems to be less owners going off MOT milage etc 

Both cars are basically identically spec'd 

There is also a silver 10 plate car I've found for 15,000 but is missing EDC and bit of spec but is 60k miles and supposedly 1 owner 


I only plan on keeping the car for 1 or 2 years, I have another car for daily driver duties so this would just be a weekend car 

All 3 cars mentioned have had Rod Bearings and Throttle Actuators done

Any suggestions or advice?

Personally I prefer the chase in Ronin. It’s the anal level of detail they went to, every stunt was real so if it required somebody getting knocked off their bike, then that required a stunt person to be knocked off a real bike by a real car and it wasn’t like sped up footage or anything, most of it was filmed at 24fps with a hard cutoff of 21fps. Oh and the actors rode along with stunt drivers in specially converted cars with dummy steering wheel on the left side while the stunt driver would be driving the thing discreetly from the right. 

Another not technically chase that I love is C’etait un Rendezvous.
