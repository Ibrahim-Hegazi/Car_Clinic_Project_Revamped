So, I quickly went to the near by car repair shop. They lifted the car and told me someone tried to steal my catalytic converter but failed. However, they cut the pipe, thus the loud noise.

I was supposed to get my car today, but no calls. So, I called to check- another mechanic answered and told me they need to change the converter. I said Sim(1st mechanic) told me my converter wasn’t missing, then he continued to explain some things I have no idea about, but I think he said he ordered something new and then he needs to weld it and the price will be $500.

\- I have a RAM ProMaster 1500 - it is build out for full time living - sink, mini fridge, solar, it's my home and everything I own is in it.

\- I have lived in it for 3 years, traveling all around CO, AZ, UT, CA, WY, MT...and have never had a rodent issue.

\- Last week I had a mouse in the van. Picked up somewhere in southern CO. Caught it, did a thorough deep clean. Two days go by and I found more droppings, now there's a second mouse, caught it again, deep cleaned again. Purchased mouse deterrent packets and put them all over the inside of the van, bought a deterrent spray and sprayed the outside of the van, doors, wheels, etc. Two days later, a third mouse. Caught, but I am at my wit's end.

\- I have no idea how this is happening: all were picked up in completely different counties after a deep clean and with deterrent. I don't know if it's possible that there's a nest somewhere - but my guess is just that they are attracted to each other's scent so now that a few mice have been around I'm drawing them in.

My question is what steps can I take to rodent proof the van further? Does anyone have experience with dealing with rodent-proofing an RV or vehicle at all? I don't know what I'm looking at when I open the hood - I don't see a mouse colony there but I'm not sure where to look. I'll take it to a car wash, but I'm not sure how to do a full undercarriage car wash or if something like that would even help. There are solar panels on top so I don't bring it through a full car wash and usually do it manually just a spray down.

What we did find, however, was a preventative for the rodents eating the wires: Simple Green.  Spray directly on any exposed wires/harnesses, full strength, and let air dry. They really don't like the taste, and it stops your wires from smelling edible.


I live in a (stationary) RV at the moment and the only thing that works for sure is cats :/ Beyond that, double check all your cabinets and food storage areas to see where they've found food - by that i mean, take everything out and visually make sure they haven't gnawed a little tunnel in from the wall: that's where they live, in the walls. That's the only way they'll ultimately sustain a population, is if they've found food; and unlikely you've gained multiple stowaways all at once. 


Edit to add: I don't recommend poison, since they usually live in the walls - you don't want them dying in there. Just have to find their food source and trap them out. "

 yes. you can hold the flat end of the cylinder rod and with a ratcheting or combo wrench screw the nut.. i would highly advice wire brushing the exposed thread clean first..  then try a 3/8-24 nut on it.. see if it will go all the way up..

 after wire brushing the exposed thread. put the proper size on.. both of them.. get them just barely past the threads and use 2 wrenches to LOCK THEM TOGETHER .. now you can use a wrench on the inner nut and on the locked pair to allow you to loosen the factory nut without chewing up the  rod..

The last couple days I’ll get some function out of it in the morning, but as I drive through the day it slowly quits functioning. There is a rattling sound when it does run like the fan is maybe struggling, but when it does blow it blows cold still.

My initial suspicion has been that the blower motor has just gone bad and needs replaced, but wanted to rule out other possibilities before tackling that because it will be either a big expense or hours worth of work. 

The AC is a manual control with a dial, 0-4, and either all or none work. I’ve checked the condenser and don’t see any ice on it, though I can’t visualize the whole thing without quite a bit of disassembly. I replaced the fuse related to the ac system, replaced the cabin air filter (which was very dirty), and there was no impact on the function. Could it be the blower resistor? Or anything else?

1norwaj,What to look for in a mechanic?/radiator replacement?,"Today my automatic 2012 Subaru Outback (~170,000 miles) started smoking/steaming when I was pulling up to someone’s house, and to my very untrained eye, it appears that the radiator hose became disconnected- coolant (I assume) everywhere, and the engine looks like it got scorched. I’m not sure how long it was smoking/steaming while I was driving because I only noticed it right as I pulled up to the house. It also looks like the edge of the plastic that the hose was clamped to broke off inside of the hose. 

I am assuming that this means I need to replace the radiator and radiator hose. I know that my car has other issues, too: I will need a new transmission because it’s only a matter of time until mine fails me (so I’ve been told by a mechanic), and my transmission also has a slow leak somewhere. 

My dad gets a discount on parts, so I was planning to buy the radiator myself and then take it to a mechanic to have it repaired so that I would only have to pay for labor and avoid the markup on materials. If that’s not feasible for me, I may need to consider getting a different car.

I used to avoid going to the mechanic when possible because I could never afford it and now that I’m a little older, I can somewhat afford it, but I feel that the last mechanic I took my car to made me feel like everything they found was a dire situation. so I paid them a few thousand dollars for all of these repairs and a lot of my car friends seem to think that I was being overcharged and that some of the repairs weren’t as immediate as they had made it sound. So I just want to educate myself on the process of getting quotes/estimates and inspections, generally, and what to look for in a reputable mechanic. Do I have to pay for someone to only take a look?

1noqfnu,Sputtering and Runs Rough Before Dying Troubleshooting,"Hi Friends, thank you for any advice you can offer. 

I have a 2010 Chrysler Town and Country, 3.8, approx. 200,000 miles.

Van was giving me no problems but suddenly died on me at a red light, finally started back after about 2 minutes of cranking and made it 1/4 mile home by gunning the engine the whole time. No codes. Seemed like ignition coil symptoms as I have dealt with this on other cars, so I installed a new one along with new plugs and wires. Plugs were sooty and black. Did not fix the issue.

I read online that cleaning the EGR valve might solve it but I dropped the part and broke the wiring harness connector while cleaning. I installed a new one and the van will run roughly at about 2000-3000 RPM if given enough throttle but will not idle. It did run long enough to throw some codes: multiple cylinder misfires and crankshaft position sensor, circuit A. I installed a new sensor but still will not run and now just says multiple cylinder misfires. 

I thought fuel pump was a possibility also as I let the tank get empty enough for the dash warning light to come on about 2 days before all this happened. I can hear it running with the ignition turned on and the van will run roughly if given enough gas before dying, Also I discovered the previous owner installed an aftermarket device called the TIPM Relay System in the fuse box; this apparently was a workaround for a faulty fuel pump relay from Chrysler. I've had the car for about 11 years and never even knew this was installed so it must have worked pretty well. I don't have a fuel pressure gauge unfortunately and I don't see a schrader valve anywhere to hook up to anyway.

1noqar7,.45 Amp Parasitic Draw | 2011 Ford E-350,"Greetings Smart Car-People of Reddit!

First post, so bear with me.

I have about a .45 amp parasitic draw on my 2011 Ford E-350 Super Duty. Kills the battery in about 2-3 days of no use. Using a multimeter, I have determined the draw to be coming from instrument cluster circuit Fuse #26 (10amp). I do not see any loose, or damaged wires around fuse box after visual inspection and there are no codes being thrown.

Other quirks that may help solve:

* The van regularly won't start in park, so I need to drop it into neutral to fire it up most of the time. Neutral safety switch issue? But I don't think that would explain the draw, right?
* The Odometer is off by about 2mph
* The digital display on the radio just recently went wonky on me and is not displaying correctly. Everything else works fine (presets, volume, etc.) 

The van will not start without the fuse, so just leaving it out is not an option. 

Any help is greatly appreciated.

 that is one of the most important things mechanics need to learn.. yep.  its taught in auto schools.. so important that its within the first few days. when you may not understand it. 

 there are easy exercises for the lower back that take only 10 seconds to perform 10 times a day. to build your lower back muscles..  

 if you have had surgery already.. do you really want to get into this heavy. 

 the exercise.. standing , sitting, walking. laying down. Pull in your stomach muscles below your belly button for 10 seconds like somebody was going to punch you in the belly..  release..  do it again a few minutes later. or an hour later.. 

 you have long muscles that go up and down the spine.. you have muscles that go over the knobs on the sides of the spine.. this builds all of those up gradually..  

 your spin is like a childs stack of ABC blocks.  how far can you bend the top of the stack over before the middle blocks fly out.  

 the muscles that go up and down your spine allow you to bend over. the angled muscles stop the spine from popping out of place like the ABC blocks when you bend the stack. 

 this is a free exercise..  oh. and when you are standing there bent over the fender or in the kitchen doing dishes and your lower back starts screaming in pain.. stop.. stand up straight.. kinda balance on your bones .. squeeze the lower stomach muscles tight for 5 seconds and release for 5 seconds.. repeat 2 more times..  poof. lower back pain gone..  contracting the muscle stops the blood flow thru the muscle. no flow. no fresh oxygenated blood.. the muscle starts screaming in pain. i need more oxygen .. your balancing on your bones and squeezing pushes out the old blood.. relaxing lets fresh blood in.. squeezing pushes that out.. and relaxing lets fresh in.. don't believe me. Try it yourself. 

 auto schools can be found at local colleges so you don't end up with a massive school loan.

 step 2B is Negative battery to the frame rail.. less than 0.04 volts ..

 step 2C is Negative battery to the radiator core support where the left and right head lights and turn signal lights are grounded to..  if the headlights are flickering the voltage output of the alternator could be changing..

 Light Green has 2 wires into the connector.. one to the blue high beam light on the dash and the other to the High Beams on the front of the truck.. turn the high beams and monitor the voltage in a conventional way with your multimeter. high beams on.. you should have a steady voltage..

 put the low beams on and back probe into the Tan wire cavity.. again you should have a steady voltage..

 lets do the same with the Yellow wire into the dimmer switch.. that should have a steady voltage.. that comes from the headlight switch in the Headlights on Position.. if you have pulsing power on all three. then we have to go farther..

1nojhe9,How cooked am I?,"Okay, get ready.
I took the rocker off my engine (2TZ-FE, overhead cams) the other day. When I took the intake and exhaust cam gears off I noticed the little dots indicating TDC were not aligned (they are tiny and there are multiple larger dots on the cam sprocket- also my first HG job). 
Took the head off and the engine is TDC, but on piston 2 & 3 instead of 1 & 4. When I try to sand the block down to remove the excess gasket material, I can feel it hitting piston 3 ever so slightly. Piston 2 is in the cylinder with the same variance that piston 3 is out of the cylinder (if that makes any sense how I've explained it).
So, I've put the NOT YET refurbished head back on with a new head gasket, hand tightening the bolts. 
My theory is to first, align the cam gears together with all the dots matched up.
Then, rotate the gears to the incorrect position where I took it off previously (as to not guess).
Then, place the cam sprocket and timing chain back onto the gear.
Finally, rotate the cams back to the correct TDC, and finish the HG job.

I have 2 questions - 

1. Am I stupid? Yes, I know, the answer is yes, but is this a bad idea to try and get the engine back to TDC? Will it damage the valves?

2. The new gasket I have on the car is from eBay. It seems okay but I was told to only use OEM head gaskets after I bought it. Use OEM or use (now dirty) eBay?

TLDR: Is it a bad idea to put the head and cams back on to set the timing correct or is my engine cooked? Also OEM HG or nah

Dont use a graphite one. To get the motor to TDC then just set the crank to TDC, then set your head to TDC and make sure the gears are locked into place with a ziptie or they make a special tool that holds the gears. Then just re assemble. On an interference engine its best to just set the timing with the head and block apart because you could end up hitting a valve if you just start moving gears and the crank independently.

We know that this pipe needs to be replaced – unfortunately, we can’t tell exactly which part it is (high-pressure line, return line, or something else).

Can anyone tell us the exact part and, if possible, provide a part number? I’ve attached the video below.

Fair enough, mechanics don’t need half the features I'm asking for, and ’m not under any illusion that a scanner can magically diagnose a car the way a mechanic can. But I think something like this should already exist.

Here’s what I'm looking for in a scanner:

* Bi-directional capabilities

* Multilingual support (most only support English but some of my friends don't speak English)
* And ideally… not $1,000 like a pro tool

Features I'd like for someone like my mum to have, who doesn't know much about cars and is constantly stressed about her car possibly breaking down:

* codes explained in plain language
* Predictive alerts (Alerts you to problems before they become major) + estimated repair costs
* Severity check (Safe to drive / fix soon / fix now)
* Tech tips, simple guides, tutorials

Some noticeable rust holes on the front fenders. It’s got a prior salvage title from the previous owner, and I believe the engine was replaced but don’t recall exactly what happened. 

For all I know it could be in mechanically great condition and have tons of life left, or it could break down tomorrow. I figure someone else could fix it up, part it out and make more than what they paid me for it, or it could be a good off-roading vehicle, that once it breaks it breaks. 

Anyways, I haven’t driven it in over a year, and was barely driving it before that. I just kinda want it gone. 

I don’t really wanna part it out so I was just thinking of selling it on marketplace for like 1-2k as is. 

I don’t have much experience selling cars, let alone cars of unknown condition. Any advice or feedback? Am I expecting too much? 

I’m located in MN in anyone was interested in buying.

They can have an impact if you use them consistently from a point at which the car is already clean. They tend to overstate their effectiveness on cars that already have some buildup. So, for example, if you were to use one of these products consistently on a new car, they can keep the slow buildup from happening at all. However, if you already have a bunch of buildup, the likelihood of these products having a noticeable impact is very low. I don't know what sort of time it would take for them to reduce that accumulated buildup.

So while they can help with long-term engine health, it's not generally a worthy investment unless you have some unusual circumstances and they are certainly not going to solve any real problems with your car.

The best thing you can do for your engine health is check/change fluids and filters regularly. Oil and gas are both pretty good about keeping their respective systems clean when properly maintained. If your car doesn't have port injection, your valves will eventually get some buildup on them, but a fuel additive isn't going to help with that since fuel isn't sprayed on them. I'm not really sure how people handle that problem aside from disassembling and cleaning by hand."

Bright_Crazy1015 (Score: 3): Just a bit of advice, when pushing a car, use the seatbelts. Pull it all the way out and sling it around your shoulder. You can push a lot harder and one or two of you can probably move it that way vs pushing on the A pillars and trunk lid

Just be ready to snatch the emergency brake or jump in and stab the brakes if you have to. 

With a broken tie rod, you may need to put that wheel on a furniture dolly something. Maybe you can kick it straight periodically, but if the wheels aren't pointed in the same direction, you won't be able to push it forward very easily. It will be easier to push it backward in some situations with broken steering components. Maybe you can zip tie it with large plastic zip ties so the wheel will stay straight once you back it out and orient it?

Personally I would push it back and attach a strap to a tow point or the subframe and pull it, vs physically pushing it, but that's just me. A tow dolly or car trailer would sure come in handy. U-Haul rents both, plus a truck that can haul it. Might consider a local storage lot if it ever comes to that with the apartment complex looking to tow it. 

Re the starter, I have had some luck taking them apart and simply cleaning them, then putting them back in. My Honda ran another 30k miles on one I cleaned after it had failed. Mightve gone further but GF totalled it. Be aware of the position of the brushes in the assembly if you do. They are worn in and should go back in the same spot if you dont replace.

1nory64,Selling an iffy condition jeep?,"
Hey all, I have a 2003 wrangler with around 190k miles. Currently needs a new battery but should run once replaced. I’m not too sure on the condition of the frame. Some noticeable rust holes on the front fenders. It’s got a prior salvage title from the previous owner, and I believe the engine was replaced but don’t recall exactly what happened. 

For all I know it could be in mechanically great condition and have tons of life left, or it could break down tomorrow. I figure someone else could fix it up, part it out and make more than what they paid me for it, or it could be a good off-roading vehicle, that once it breaks it breaks. 

Anyways, I haven’t driven it in over a year, and was barely driving it before that. I just kinda want it gone. 

I don’t really wanna part it out so I was just thinking of selling it on marketplace for like 1-2k as is. 

I don’t have much experience selling cars, let alone cars of unknown condition. Any advice or feedback? Am I expecting too much?

have a 2015 Ford escape, a little over 2 years ago it started stuttering when driving and the error transmission fault would come on.  We took it to a shop that said we needed to rebuild the transmission so we did.  A couple months ago it started having the same problems— had a hard time finding first gear but then once you got going it drove normally, same error.  We took it to a different shop (the first shop is 40 miles away so out of convenience took it somewhere closer) they said it needs a new transmission.  Having just rebuilt it 2 years ago we were a little shocked.  A friend of our looked at it and said there was no transmission fluid so we filled it up and nothings changed.  I was told in a different thread that we are technically supposed to check those levels every month and so it’s our fault essentially it was driving in low fluid.  We’ve never monthly checked transmission fluids in any car so did not know to do that.  I’m aware of the problems of driving with low fluid etc, we didn’t know or had any indicator of a problem otherwise and so here we are.  Our last step would be to take it to the original shop and ask what they can do for us as it seems to me something likely happened in the rebuild that caused a leak?  But finally here is my question, we don’t have much money to replace this car.

1no6j0z,'97 4Runner | Rumble at Idle / Aggressive idle & crawl RPMs / CEL on,"Hello!

I am a serious DIY and repair noob with an older car which I love! I need some help diagnosing...

Make: Toyota

Model: 4Runner

SKU: 3.4L V6 4AT

Milage: \~79K

ISSUE:

The issues all started with a simple misfire on cylinder 4 (confirmed by a DTC check) which caused a CEL to come on. My buddy (a certified auto mechanic) and I replaced the fuel injector for cylinder 4 using a remanufactured injector from RockAuto. We also replaced the fuel filter (also RockAuto and required some plumbers tape to not leak), filled with brand new coolant, and changed out all spark plugs.

Our efforts solved the misfire for a few days, but then the CEL returned...this time with 8 codes and a litany of new issues! I, however, was NOT experiencing engine rumbles or poor driving experience. So, in true idiot fashion, I simply cleared the codes thinking that it was a fluke from all of the time that we had the manifold apart and the fuel pressure drained.

Well, I drove around a bit more and noticed the following symptoms:

\- A new CEL (third in total so far in my story) appeared.

\- Moderate and unpredictable rumble coming up through transfer-case shifter (4WD shifter) and engine bay at idle and low speeds.

I scanned the DTCs again and found:

1. CAT and EVAP tests NEVER COMPLETE. They sit and flash on my **Innova 3011s**  forever until the reader throws ""ERROR.""
2. I have a ""Pending"" P0171 and a ""Stored"" P0171. I am not sure how the exact same code for the MAF detecting a lean run can be both pending AND stored (maybe somebody can help me understand)?

BOTTOM LINE:

I am very new at this and am at critical risk of wearing out my welcome with my very kind friend that has helped me thus far with this vehicle. I really care about this car since it was my grandparents, and is also just a wonderful and useful vehicle...a real classic. If possible, I need some help figuring out what the heck is going on.

1noro2j,2000 Ford Ranger V6,"Long story, bear with me. Sorry.

A few months ago I was driving my 2000 ford ranger when it started making pretty loud engine (like semi) noises, drove it home (just a mile), let it sit, and checked the oil, and there was none on the dipstick. Asked someone what to do, they said just add oil to it, see if it’s loud, test drive it, see what happens. Basically if it’s shot it’s shot is what I heard from multiple people. (At this same time I figured out it needed an oil change September of last year…I’m an idiot I know). So I added oil to it (it only took 1 quart, so made me hopeful it wasn’t actually completely out of oil, just enough for the dipstick). Drove it for 10 minutes, seemed fine. It did leak slightly (just a few drops onto cardboard. But definitely has a leak).

I then got my grandmas car, and didn’t need to worry about it, but have to now. Thought everything would hopefully be fine.

Tried to start it, didn’t start but jumped it and and started fine (was loud, but expected). But now it’s making this loud screechy clicking sound, I tried to get a video, but it’s much much louder then it appears in the video. I let it run for ~15 minutes and it stayed the same. Shut it off, sat a bit, and it wouldn’t start again. I’m afraid to jump it again and drive it…don’t wanna make it worse.

SOO…questions..and advice???

Do you think the engine is shot? Could it be a loud fan and I’m over reacting? Do I just drive it and see what happens?

What should I do..? I’m broke.

Obviously need something to happen with the battery. I have a battery through interstate battery, maybe have a 1-2years left on insurance (depletes over time), so will cost $150? I’ll call and figure that out. Not the important part.

But big question, do I just go get an oil change and ask them when start it and listen to it, if they think there’s any issues with it? If it stops making noise after oil change is it good? I know it has the leak, but I can deal with that and add oil occasionally temporarily.

I’ve called a lot of mechanic places near me and all are charging absurd prices for diagnostics (I can’t afford a $300 checkup to be told it’s another $1500 to fix). If I get an oil change maybe they’ll also check it a little?

Basically need any advice on what I should do.

Thank you so much if you made it through this long rant!! Thank you for anything!

I also will apologize for the longer post this turned out to be but I feel the nuances are relevant here to avoid unhelpful suggestions we've already tried...... looking forward to some feedback from those kind enough to share their knowledge here.  

Backstory: 
I actually bought this POS at a public auction a couple years ago & paid way 2 much for what I got. I was dumb & saw the description said
key ✅️ runs ✅️ drives ✅️

and *technically* that's true. But it's had the same problem demonstrated in my video since we mistakenly rolled it off that yard & me and my hubby can't figure out the culprit of this for the life of us. We are *really* hoping we are able to fix it because we can't just afford to throw the money we've put into it away already if we can help it.  

We are a pretty proficient team together at fixing cars & have honestly tackled some serious jobs on several of our older mechanics special vehicles together before despite no formal training in the field or anything, so a semi-big job doesn't intimidate us as long as we aren't having to rebuild a transmission or something. 

It makes the sound from the attached video every time we try to take it for a test drive, which is rarely & only for distances of a couple blocks or so, and only after we've tried yet another potential remedy (we def avoid driving it other than that due to the noise) that ends up failing to be the issue we are trying to isolate. 

When we picked up this piece, it made the noise right from driving it off the lot which was a huge let down immediately. We were surprised we could drive it at all since once we limped it slowly home that night we got it, we noticed a completely broken sway bar link on passenger side if i remember the correct side. We thought, ""great! That's our problem right there and ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Nope. Definitely didn't fix jack. Grrrrrr! So frustrating! 

Anyway, here's some other tidbits that might help in isolating the problem: we've noticed it only makes the God-awful popping/grinding noise when it's *IN GEAR* and *MOVING*. a.k.a. if we put it in gear, (drive, reverse, etc., it doesn't matter) while holding the brake down and revving the engine it DOES NOT make the noise if it's not moving.

We've already determined it's NOT the:
👉 driveshaft
👉 doesn't need gear oil in either the front or the rear differential any longer. We replaced the front gear oil today, and it was dark & smelled kinda like B.O. and all but didn't have a bunch of metal bits in it. When we checked the rear diff it was bone dry so we filled er up. Clearly didn't fix the problem. 

We are now at a crossroads & don't know wtf to try next. We were thinking of changing out the ATF4 in the transfer case, or possibly even trading out the entire transfer case? But while we've both gained a TON of self- taught experience from YouTube videos & reddit forums on multiple cars,  so we aren't afraid to get our hands dirty & have a little frustrating but educational adventure, the transfer case is heavy & seems a bit more difficult to remove & stuff if that's what is necessary.  I don't wanna F around with rebuilding it or the chain or anything.  But we are down to do a swap if that's what the actual issue is. We've just tried so many other expensive time- consuming repairs & that wasn't it,  so really we are so confused & frustrated and don't want to change out the transfer case if that isn't what the issue is....

..... which brings me to this forum, gracoously seeking solid advice from people who know.  Because lawd knows we are poor & can't afford to take this betch into a shop to diagnose and DEF can't afford for a shop to repair it.  This purchase was the dumbest one I've ever made, personally. Never again! Lol. 

We were also thinking the noise could be related to the broken sway bar link & have a messed up / loose control arm or something.  

Honestly, your guess is probably better than mine,  which brings me here today.  I know this is long & overly detailed but I also know all the little details in auto repair usually really REALLY make a difference, so plz excuse the novel.

So then I took it to a Toyota frame shop and they said that little won’t cause a damaged frame and then fast forward two months which is today I decided to get alignment check and that’s where the second picture comes in.

So my question is what do you guys think is wrong with my car? I am having shaking and pulling to the side problem.

I heard someone say the bad caster won’t cause shaking and it will only cause straight-line stability and steering return.

So I am thinking of just doing wheel rotation and fixing the alignment for the shaking part but I don’t know what to do about the caster ",8,1758656731.0,57,mechanic,1758742402,2025-09-23 19:45:31,2025-09-24 19:33:22,"SupremeOHKO (Score: 14): When you take it to get it aligned they should be able to point you in the right direction.

Desmoaddict (Score: 4): Let's go over some alignment basics. 

Roads are crowned. That means the center of the road is higher than the outsides of the road to allow for drainage. If you roll a ball down the street it will always roll to the gutter. Unless you're on a banked road, you'll always have a pull however minuscule to the drainage at the curb. 

Toe is the front edge of your wheel pointed in towards each other or away from each other. Toe is generally set straight and even. Some vehicles require pressed toe which means there is a spring bar put between the front edges of the tire to push on it to get your final measurement to show what it would be like while rolling. Toe is always set at the front, some vehicles have a allowance to set it for the rear. On the rear it can also affect the center line of the car. Your front end could be straight but if the rear toe is out it will still be turning like a forklift.

Camber is the top edge of the wheel pointed in towards each other or away from each other. Generally there is a miniscule amount of camber with the top edges of the tires tilted slightly in towards the center of the vehicle. Generally not enough for you to identify with the naked eye. Most vehicles will have allowance for this to be adjusted in the front and occasionally adjusted in the back. You generally want this equal across both sides.

Caster most simply is the angle of pivot of your steering. Think of a bicycle, where the steering tube on the frame is not straight up and down it's slightly angled where the wheel is forward. Caster is usually positive which means the wheel is slightly forward of where the top of the strut would be. The farther forward the caster is the more stable the vehicle is. More isn't always better, because it resists steering. You want it just right. A car that cruises at high speed on the Autobahn will generally be designed with a more positive caster, race cars will have a less positive caster so they can make corners quicker. Caster is an interesting one because it is not a tire wearing angle (there's more to this, with how wheel angles are affected during steering, but we're keeping it simple here). Is camber slightly off it won't affect your tires. That's actually good news because you can have your right side camber slightly forward of the left and it helps compensate for that pull that road crown provides so you're not constantly getting pushed to the right into the gutter. 

Subframes are attached to the main body of the car and the lower parts of the suspension. Sometimes the subframes can slip a little bit and it will change your alignment angles. It's actually a trick they use on alignment rack if they are maxing out adjustments and you're still not in spec, they can slip the subframe over to compensate. Many times the subframe needs to be moved because it's not in a centered position. Generally an impact would have to be directly into the subframe for it to be damaged before the suspension arms would be damaged. 

Typical suspension wear is due to the pivot points and the bushings either wearing out or aging. Pivot points get looser like ball joints as they wear. Bushings start to sag because they're made out of rubber and if they're always being pushed in one direction they slowly give to that direction. Once bushings age enough they will start to split and crack which can allow the component to move more than it should and potentially cause additional damage to adjacent components. 

Your first alignment sheet showed an improper camber adjustment. It also showed no compensation with caster to prevent pulling from road crown. Your second alignment sheet shows a similar condition as the first but the toe is being pushed outwards. This is generally from either worn steering components or someone who drives into a curb or parking stop regularly to park their car. The curb and the parking stops are a guideline or safety, they are not to stop a vehicle that's in motion for normal parking.

Edt: forgot to mention the shaking issue.

Typically that is a wheel imbalance. Generally with a wheel and balance you'll find that it hits at different speeds because of harmonics. It'll usually shake within about a 5 to 10 mph range and then that shake will go away and then potentially come back in at a higher speed. This can happen for multiple reasons. I'll give you a short list.. 

Tire wear: some manufacturers don't monitor tire density as well so as you wear the tire it can come out of balance 

Loose weight: One of the balancing weights came loose. Sometimes they just come unstuck because the surface wasn't cleaned properly before they stuck new weights on when they balanced your new tires 

Bent wheel: You change the shape of the wheel it changes how it balances. Heading a pot hole or running it into curbs could do this 

Water: this one's a little obscure, but sometimes if you go to a gas station and fill up your tires, there may be some water in the air hose because their compressor doesn't get filtered and drained properly. Now you have a puddle of water flopping around inside your wheel where there should only be air.

Tire failure: sometimes due to poor construction or due to impact like a pothole the inner and outer layers of the tread area can separate and lead to a misshapen tire. If this happens there is a high risk of catastrophic failure 

Honorable Mention - flat spots: vehicles without ABS who lock up the brakes, or people who like to use the parking brake and slide the back end around, can wear flat spots in the tires from sliding them. This wear is only fixed by replacing the tire. There's also this fun thing with performance tires that are very sticky and soft that if you get them nice and hot and then park them on a cool surface they will have a flat spot that will soften up and regain its shape after about 10 minutes of driving. The performance tire flat spot isn't an issue, it's normal, just a quirk of having high performance tires."
1nooxsm,$3k to get my car after clutch replacement 2006 Ford Mustang GT,"Clutch went out on my Mustang took it too a shop they said clutch fluid had leaked all over the clutch and ruined it needs a whole new clutch about $1300. I said do it they said would be done in a week. I called every week they said will be done Friday, will be done next Friday, should be done this week. 
  Okay they get the clutch replaced but they said the brakes weren’t working right (I noticed there was little extra play in the brake pedal but still seemed to stop fine for me) they said it’s not safe needs a new brake master cylinder. I say alright get it done. They say should be done by Friday and of course it’s not so the next week on Wednesday they called me and said “it’s ready to rip up the road”
So I go over there and they had to replace the battery also because it kept dying? Like yeah if you leave it sitting for 20+ days and only turn it on just to turn it back off real quick probably gunna kill the battery. So extra $160 for the battery. It’s $1650 to get my car out but thank god I have it back feel so much relief. 
Drive it home seems fine I get ready for work and take it on the highway as soon as I hit 45 mph the sterring violently shakes I pull over and notice the car stopped in neutral on a decline like a brake is locked up. So much for “rip up the road”
Take it back to them and like 4 days later tell me a caliper is seized a rotors are warped and one rotor is destroyed because a brake pad was put on backwards??? He said “don’t yell at me but it will be $1500 to replace these maybe less if you don’t need brake lines” so 3k when I just wanted my clutch replaced. I’m not paying for rotor and caliper work and shit I can do that myself but god damn.

1nolh5s,Suzuki Kei Car Problem,"I purchased my Suzuki Palette MK21S K6A (2009 model, 98,500 km) from a dealer in October last year, and at first there were no issues. In June, after driving about 3,000 km, I did an oil change as recommended for Kei cars. The following week, during the summer heat, the oil warning light began turning on and off randomly. At first, I thought it was just a faulty connector or sensor.

Now in September, the issue persists. The oil light usually appears once the engine warms up (after about 10 minutes) or when the outside temperature is high. It sometimes stays on when idling but often disappears while driving. In total, I’ve already driven about 900 km with this issue.

I brought the car to a Suzuki dealer in Japan, and their diagnosis pointed to a faulty oil pressure sensor. We replaced the sensor, but the problem remained. The mechanic then told me it could be an internal engine issue, where lubrication is not working properly. However, he said he could not confirm without a very expensive and time-consuming inspection.

I paid for the oil pressure sensor replacement, but the warning light problem was never solved. I then asked some mechanic friends for advice. They told me that if the engine itself were really at fault, I wouldn’t have been able to drive 900 km without a more serious breakdown. Two of them believe the oil change might have been done incorrectly and recommend doing it again. Another said the oil viscosity could be the issue. The garage used 0W20 oil, but my friend believes this might not be ideal even if officially recommended.

Additionally, Suzuki told me that the previous oil change (done two months earlier) looked poorly done because they found oil deposits and residue, suggesting it was not a clean job.

My intention was to sell the car in October in good condition, since parking costs in Tokyo have gone up and I cannot afford to keep it. I bought the car for 170,000 yen (about 1,150 USD), but now I’m in a complicated situation.

I have a IS250C 2010 (the V6 coupe), was doing oil change the other day and checking the service logs. Apparently, when my car was 90k miles it was recommended by the Lexus dealership to do tranmission fluid change... 

  
I got my car at 100k miles, it's now 128k miles. 

I called my friend's transmission guy today, and I asked for a quote for transmission fluid change. And he asked me why I need a transmission change, if anything's wrong. I just told him my car seem to never had it changed, and I had been procrastinating because of money issues. I want to keep my car around and hopefully not having problems so I would like to have it fixed. Then he said it is too late for it, i shouldn't change it. The parts in the car is probably old and the fluid is new, that might cause problem. He recommended me to not change it, and i asked what if things f up down the road? He said ""when there's a issue. you fix that issue""

So what's the deal?

1nowhj8,2016 Ford F150 Mystery Sound,"Hi everyone,

The sound I’m referring to comes in around the 11-second mark of the video above. It’s been happening for a few months now, and despite showing this video to two reputable shops (one I’ve trusted with both my truck and my wife’s car for years), no one has been able to pin down the cause. I’m hoping someone here might recognize it.

To me, it sounds like a high-pitched whistle—almost like two pieces of rubber sliding against each other. The first shop suspected an exhaust leak but couldn’t find one. The second thought it might be the torque converter, so they flushed the transmission and replaced the fluid, but the noise persisted.

A few more details: the sound only shows up after the engine warms up and mostly in the higher gears. The longer I drive, the more frequently it happens, and it sometimes carries over into the lower gears. It’s most noticeable when I’m on the interstate going up a long hill. It often happens right after a downshift, though not always. The sound only occurs while pressing the accelerator, and when it does, I can feel a slight vibration in the pedal. It also seems to be getting more common the longer I drive with it.

2. Vacuum Leaks
Even if you're getting a smoke test later, you can do a DIY vacuum test:
Spray brake cleaner or carb cleaner around intake manifold, hoses, throttle body area at idle.
If idle changes, you've found a leak.
3. Intake Plumbing
Check between the MAF and throttle body for:
Cracks in rubber intake boot
Loose clamps
Small tears in any hoses connected to the intake
4. Fuel Pressure
If you have access to a fuel pressure gauge, check it.
Low pressure = possible clogged filter, weak pump, or bad FPR.

If it’s lazy, it might not be detecting fuel properly and sending false lean readings.
You can swap Bank 1 and Bank 2 upstream O2s to see if the code follows.

1nop8lc,"Vehicle Not Starting, No Lights/Electricity, No Sound","1999 Toyota Camrey, about 280000 miles, 4 cylinder manual/stick shift. I'm not sure if cylinders equate to engine size, sorry.

This morning, I tried to start my engine to head into town. It'd been sitting in the yard for about a week and hasn't shown any sort of issues as far as I know leading up to this. On turning the key, I found that my car refused to start. None of the lights were turning on, either internal or external, and there wasn't any clicking sound like what I've read happens with a bad alternator.

The car was able to start after being jumpstarted. It started easily when directly connected to the vehicle, but I turned it off and let the charge go into the battery for a few minutes. Thankfully it was able to turn on yet again, and the door light and sound came on this time (and while the electricity was running through the jumper cables), but it was auditorily struggling to turn on. Again, no clicking, it just took longer than usual for it to start up.

I took it to AutoZone to get the battery looked at. The guy said when he initially checked it, it was at 30%, and after it was on for a bit (again, struggling to turn on), it increased to 35%. I cannot corroborate the original 30% as I didn't see the number. He suggested that the battery wasn't being charged by the car somehow, perhaps through something within the vehicle draining the battery, but couldn't say for certain. I don't know how likely this explanation is, as the only real experience I have working with cars is replacing spark plugs, replacing something else within the hood whose name escapes me, and replacing a radiator. I purchased a battery charger in the hope that this would help, though I'm somewhat doubtful that it will.

The vehicle started twice after, both to leave AutoZone and to leave a gas station. It especially struggled on the latter. About 2 hours after parking at another location, it refused to turn on, again no lights, no sound, the car was just dead. Once again, it only responded to being jumpstarted.

Does anybody have any idea about what the issue with my car might be, and if it's something I might be able to fix myself if I find the right tools and parts? Is it the starter? The alternator? Something else entirely? Is something draining my battery? Would I need a professional to get this looked at? Does my battery just need to be charged? I don't understand what's going on here, and I desperately need to make sure my car remains operable.

Some say that it is sufficient to wait 5 or 10 minutes after turning off the engine...

As I AM NOT A MECHANIC AND I AM NOT AN EXPERT AT ALL, logically I would say that the engine oil level should be checked with a perfectly innovative and COLD engine; in fact... with the engine stopped for just 5 or 10 minutes the oil level is always significantly lower than when checking the level with a cold engine, i.e. when ALL the oil has had time to settle on the bottom of the engine.

Thanks in advance to anyone who can give me the right answer.


**Added to give more details**
I am the proud owner of a Volvo V60 D3 first series from 2011 purchased used.
This machine does NOT have a conventional dipstick for checking the oil level and the check must be carried out only electronically... however... if you look carefully in the front part of the engine block very very low there is a very small physical dipstick... even if it is a bit difficult to extract it _(especially when the engine is hot)_.

‼️ MY PROBLEM IS THAT if I check the oil level with this small and hidden physical dipstick
- when the engine has been off for 5 or 10 minutes, the oil level **is perfect**.
- However, when the engine is cold/warm and has stopped for a few hours, the level is EXTREMELY HIGHER, exceeding the maximum level mark by more than double!

- if instead I check with the cold and/or lukewarm engine stopped for many hours, the oil level exceeds the optimal level reference mark found on my dipstick by just over double.

My guess is that switch is faulty, or loose, or maybe you have floor mats that are stopping you pushing the clutch pedal right down.

It won't be an alternator issue. It \*might\* be a starter motor issue. But I think a clutch safety switch issue is much more likely, given that it will start if you push the clutch pedal down hard a couple of times.

1no81uv,2015 Malibu stalls at stoplights after driving a while (no check engine light),"2015 Chevrolet Malibu 2.5 stalls when taking off from a stop (only after warm-up)

Car: 2015 Chevrolet Malibu, 2.5L Ecotec, ~103k miles.  

Problem:  
- When cold or idling during warm-up, the engine runs perfectly fine.  
- After 40–60 minutes of city or highway driving, once the engine is fully warmed up, the car starts stalling at stop signs/lights when taking off.  
- The stall happens quietly, without jerking or shaking.  
- After stalling, the engine does not restart right away: sometimes it takes 2–3 attempts, and even on the first attempt I have to hold the key in the **Start** position for several seconds before it fires up.  
- During these restarts, the engine cranks and starts much quieter than during a normal cold start.  
- Occasionally I also feel about a 10–15% loss of power, and the engine sounds louder than usual while driving.  
- Check Engine light is OFF.  

What has been done so far:  
- In the past, CEL codes indicated faulty VVT solenoids and crankshaft position sensor. After replacing those parts, the Check Engine light no longer comes on. Codes were cleared and there are none stored now.  
- Replaced all 3 VVT solenoids (on engine).  
- Replaced crankshaft position sensor (adaptations reset with Autel scanner only for this sensor).  
- Replaced catalytic converter.  
- Replaced spark plugs with new iridium plugs.  
- Cleaned throttle body (did not reset throttle adaptations with a scan tool, only performed pedal relearn).  
- Fuel system cleaned with **BG 44K Platinum Fuel System Cleaner** (added to fuel tank).  
- Replaced both cabin air filter and engine air filter.  
- Engine oil changed regularly.  
- Transmission fluid replaced 22k miles ago.  
- Vehicle was inspected at a service shop; mechanic said “everything looks normal,” but the stalling issue persists.

From Google. 


The 2015 Chevrolet Malibu equipped with the start/stop system has been reported to experience issues related to engine stalling, particularly when the system attempts to shut off the engine at stoplights. A common problem involves the system failing to shut off properly, which can lead to stalling or erratic behavior, potentially due to a malfunction in the brake pedal position sensor.
 This issue was acknowledged by GM, which was evaluating the root cause as of April 2015, though no recall or service bulletin was issued at that time.

Intermittent stalling when coming to a stop is a frequently reported symptom, often linked to the start/stop system's operation. Some owners have found that the system may not engage correctly after a battery reset or if the throttle body is dirty, which can cause the engine to stall upon stopping.
 Cleaning the throttle body with brake cleaner has been reported as a successful fix for some drivers.
 Additionally, the system's failure to function correctly can be influenced by the state of the battery and the dual battery control module (DBCM), which manages the system's power needs. If the alternator and battery test as functional, a failing DBCM may be the culprit, requiring replacement.

Other contributing factors to stalling include issues with the variable valve timing solenoids (VVT), which can malfunction due to low or dirty oil, leading to hesitation and stalling after stops.
 The start/stop system can also be disabled by shifting into manual (M) mode, which prevents the auto-stop function from engaging.
 Furthermore, the system relies on various sensors, including the passenger seat occupancy sensor, and faults in these sensors or their wiring can prevent the system from operating correctly, potentially leading to stalling or the system not engaging at all."

1no6zux,My car randomly rumbles and throws CEL...any suggestions?,"Hello!

I am a serious DIY and repair noob with an older car which I love! I need some help diagnosing...

Make: Toyota

Model: 4Runner

SKU: 3.4L V6 4AT

Milage: \~79K

ISSUE:

The issues all started with a simple misfire on cylinder 4 (confirmed by a DTC check) which caused a CEL to come on. My buddy (a certified auto mechanic) and I replaced the fuel injector for cylinder 4 using a remanufactured injector from RockAuto. We also replaced the fuel filter (also RockAuto and required some plumbers tape to not leak), filled with brand new coolant, and changed out all spark plugs.

Our efforts solved the misfire for a few days, but then the CEL returned...this time with 8 codes and a litany of new issues! I, however, was NOT experiencing engine rumbles or poor driving experience. So, in true idiot fashion, I simply cleared the codes thinking that it was a fluke from all of the time that we had the manifold apart and the fuel pressure drained.

Well, I drove around a bit more and noticed the following symptoms:

\- A new CEL (third in total so far in my story) appeared.

\- Moderate and unpredictable rumble coming up through transfer-case shifter (4WD shifter) and engine bay at idle and low speeds.

I scanned the DTCs again and found:

1. CAT and EVAP tests NEVER COMPLETE. They sit and flash on my **Innova 3011s** forever until the reader throws ""ERROR.""
2. I have a ""Pending"" P0171 and a ""Stored"" P0171. I am not sure how the exact same code for the MAF detecting a lean run can be both pending AND stored (maybe somebody can help me understand)?

BOTTOM LINE:

I am very new at this and am at critical risk of wearing out my welcome with my very kind friend that has helped me thus far with this vehicle. I really care about this car since it was my grandparents, and is also just a wonderful and useful vehicle...a real classic. If possible, I need some help figuring out what the heck is going on.

1no6ops,Is it ok to have battery charger/maintainer hooked up while car is running/trying to turn on?,"So it seems that I have a fairly large parasitic draw somewhere in my vehicle. I’ve checked the most obvious connection points, pulled fuses, uninstalled any aftermarket accessories, etc.

No matter what I do, it seems like the car just keeps killing the battery. It does it so fast I can’t even check what Amperage it’s pulling. I’ve used my battery charger/maintainer to get three different batteries fully charged up (verified to be in good working condition using 2 other vehicles), but as soon as I plug in the positive and negative side, it practically gets emptied in seconds. I can literally see the voltage counting down on my multimeter. I even tried to use a battery jumper pack, but it also completely drained that in like 20-30 seconds.

Because the battery gets drained so fast, it seems impossible for me to test fuse/relay ports individually using a multimeter.

I’m guessing it’s shorting somewhere, but is it possible for a short to be drawing this much power?

Anyway, I guess my main question is if it’s ok to keep the battery maintainer/charger on the battery while it’s hooked up to the car.

**Original issue:**  
Came back to my car (2009 RAV4 4-cyl, 135,475 mi) after three days of covered airport parking and the battery was dead. Parking lot staff gave me a jump, but the car died again after just a few minutes of driving, before I got on the freeway. Had AAA tow me to my mechanic. 

**What the shop found:** 

* Battery had shorted internally (not drained).
* Alternator and charging system checked out fine.
* They suggested replacing the battery since my last battery replacement was four years ago, when they also had to replace the alternator. 

**What happened next:**

* They replaced the battery (and did an oil change at my request).)
* After the new battery went in, they noticed a very low idle/shaking, and the car wouldn't restart cleanly. 
* They called me to inform me that they'd like to spend more time (at an $80/hour labor charge) to reset the computer memory.
* They tried a computer memory (ECU) reset first as the computer had lost its idle memory.
* When that didn’t solve it, they inspected and found **carbon buildup in the throttle body**.
* They cleaned the throttle body (another hour of labor), re-reset the system, and the idle issue went away.
* This was an additional two hours of labor + $160 on top of the original quote. 

**Summary of order:**  
Battery replacement → ECU reset → throttle body cleaning.

**Questions:** 

1. Is this normal for a 2009 RAV4 with \~135k miles and no prior throttle body cleanings? I’ve never had idle issues before, but I understand the ECU can “compensate” until memory is wiped. Just curious if this is expected maintenance at this age/mileage or if it sounds like I got pushed into an unnecessary service.
2. What can cause a battery that had no noticeable issues to short? I just assumed I'd left a light on before being gone for four days and drained it, but they said that wasn't the issue here.

First some info : My car is a 2018 Ford Fiesta ST Mk8 (german spec) with about 130k km on the clock, It has some mods, nothing crazy, just a full exhaust, intake, dump valve and a remap. 
Today I was driving on the highway at about 180km/h for a solid 10/15 minutes straight, then the car suddenly lost some power and I heard a clear misfire. I pulled on the side, pulled my code reader and had a P0301 code (cylinder 1 misfire).
I went out to hear the exhaust and the misfire stopped, so I cleared the code and restarted the car to see if it would come back, and nothing.. 
Then It just drove like nothing happened on my way home.

1noxibm,Private car sale – buyer taking me to court,"Hi everyone,
I’m being taken to small claims court and would really appreciate some advice.

I sold my Ford Focus Ecoboost privately earlier this year. The buyer viewed the car, test drove it, and bought it in running condition. About 2 months later, he contacted me saying the wet belt had gone and the engine failed. When he took it to a garage, they told him the engine had been swapped at some point and didn’t match what was on the V5.

He’s now claiming under the Misrepresentation Act 1967, saying I sold him a car that wasn’t as described and wants a full refund plus fees. I’ve defended the claim — I have a court date in around 2–3 months, and mediation has already taken place.

My position is:

1) The car was sold privately, not as a trade sale.
2) It was in good working order at the time of sale.
3) The buyer drove it for 2 months with no problems before the breakdown.
4) I had no knowledge of any engine swap.
5) The only time this came to light was after the engine failed and was dismantled at the garage.

I never claimed the engine was original, as I had no reason or way of knowing it wasn’t. I sold the car in good faith and honestly don’t see how I could be liable for something I didn’t know about and couldn’t reasonably have checked.

In a situation like this, in a private sale, do I actually owe him anything? Or is this just something the buyer has to accept as risk once he’s bought and used the car?

Thanks in advance for any advice — I’m pretty stressed about it and want to know where I stand.

-BMW 5 Series 2018
-Toyota Corolla 2020/2021 (Hatchback/Saloon)
-Skoda Octavia 2020/2021 Hatchback

Are these good options? Are there other o
Automatic options which could suit instead?
Any general advice for someone in my situation?

I came across the Skoda Superb, Kia Sportage and Toyota RAV4. Is there anything that has tons of rear legroom that is within the £15-18k price range? I am spending so much time just googling stuff and using auto trader to gander at prices.

Any suggestions? I've been told Kia and Toyota have the best warranty and long term reliability. That's my main priority, something for a family man with 3 kids, plenty of legroom and comfort for the kiddos but also economical to run. Plugin hybrid might be a stretch at this budget...

You'll still see it turn blue, meaning rust is present and it's making black oxides which are stable, whereas red oxides (rust) is not. 

Even when wire wheeling you'll have rust under the surface (try tapping it with a peen hammer after wire wheel and you'll see fresh orange)

Once you've wire wheeled and removed as much as you can, then use a rust converter. I like kurust, it dries hard and glassy.

Once you've converted, wire wheel again and reapply converter. This gets good results, not sure why.

The 12.5% one had a Skoda yeti 2017 plate dsg on the forecourt which had just sold for £18125 this is more than wheh the car was new according to the dealership. The mileage on the car was 35,000.

1nodd35,Student on placement year – should I buy a car or keep my old one?,"Hi all, I’d like some advice on whether it makes sense for me to buy a used car right now.
	•	I’m a student on a year-long placement until August 2026.
	•	I just got my license a month ago.
	•	Income: £1,300/month (might increase to £1,500).
	•	Goal: I need to save at least £7,000 for tuition fees.
	•	Current car: 2008 Nissan Micra 1.2, 101,400 miles. It still runs but I’m not sure how reliable it will be long-term.
	•	Budget if I replace it: under £2,000.

From what I’ve worked out:
	•	A car (insurance, tax, MOT, fuel, etc.) will cost me around £250–£400/month, plus the upfront purchase price.
	•	To hit my £7k tuition savings, I need to put aside about £640/month. That leaves me with about £300–£560/month for everything else after savings + car costs, depending on my income.

My dilemma:
	•	Should I just keep running the Micra until it dies and focus on saving?
	•	Or should I replace it now with something “newer” under £2k (Honda Jazz, Toyota Yaris, Suzuki Alto, etc.) in case the Micra lets me down during the placement year?

Basically, do I risk stretching my budget for peace of mind with a newer car, or do I squeeze more life out of the Micra to save money faster?

If the answer to both of these is yes.  Then have a look on Autotrader for similar vehicles of the same make/model/trim/colour/mileage to get an idea of its current market value.

Insurers will usually agree a cash in lieu settlement if the quotes from your bodyshop/repairer are below 50-60% of the current market value of the vehicle.

They'll pay you the cash to get the work done, and that'll be the end of your claim.  This means they don't write the vehicle off, or put a total loss marker on the MIAFTR database (Get them to confirm they have not done this prior to accepting any CIL settlement).

If you write the vehicle off, they'll give you the current market value minus your excess plus the salvage value they would have received had they salvaged the vehicle (Usually between 10-30%)

Things to consider before you go down the CIL route.  Is it a good runner? May be worth keeping. Or have you had to pump a lot of money in to it recently, and regularly find yourself putting money in to it to keep it running?  If yes, get rid.

Some will be fine and increase a small amount but others won’t insure you etc.

You'd be better off, if you're set on keeping it anyway, on suspension mods."
1no3gk1,Car performance/tuning chips,"Hi everyone, I was just wondering if anyone could offer some help/information on this topic. I recently bought a Vauxhall Astra 1.6T 2013 and since getting it I’ve realised how much it eats petrol. I’ve recently tried making sure I’m driving more economically so that I can maximise the MPG but it’s still just annoying me that I can’t get the average MPG higher than 36. 

I was looking online and found something called “Racechip” which say they not only improve bhp & nm (which is useful for when I wanna have some fun) but also can improve fuel efficiency and the app allows me to put the car into an eco mode so it can achieve this. Is Racechip good or tuning chips in general good? If anyone could provide some help that’d be much appreciated.",1,1758587942.0,2,CartalkUK,1758742402,2025-09-23 00:39:02,2025-09-24 19:33:22,"Chungus_2017 (Score: 1): These tuning boxes don't improve mpg, they usually increase boost which means more power and fuel

Most likely around the same price as a race chip, you might even get a bit more bhp depending on how it’s mapped.

I've used [Quantum Tuning ](https://www.quantumtuning.co.uk/)before to good effect, in my case with a non-flashable ECU they the took it away, remapped it and gave it back a few days later. Got better power AND economy in my '01 2.2 Vectra DTi SRi.

PurpWippleM3 (Score: 1): Let's assume you gain 20% and get up to 44MPG from a £400 remap - which is unlikely, but let's play the game.

That 8MPG improvement will take ~13000 miles to pay for the remap cost, excluding any increase in insurance cost once you declare the remap.

How many miles a year do you do?"

Suzuki Swift. Another fun car, reliable. Avoid the diesel though


Mazda 2 same as the Fiesta underneath has different engines though


Leftfield choice would be a Fiat Panda 100


I wouldn't spend your entire budget on basic runabout because you'll just lose money in depreciation. Plus you probs wanna hold a bit back to help pay for insurance.
