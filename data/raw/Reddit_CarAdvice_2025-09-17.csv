1nixpmn,Rear passenger seatbelt is stuck and cannot be pulled out,"I have a 2017 Chevy Cruze. The other night while going to buckle his seat, my son could not pull out his seat belt.

1nixn0k,EVAP issues after fuel pump replacement,"Vehicle is 1997 Dodge Ram Van 3500. 35 gallon fuel tank, in-tank fuel pump.

  
After replacing the fuel pump, we noticed issues filling it at the gas station. Gas pump would shut off every 3-5 seconds unless filled at minimal rate. Only filled it to a quarter tank to test drive and make sure we did everything right. Van fired right up (it had serious problems starting before due to failing fuel pump) and ran better than it ever has so we didn't think much of it. Next day, I go to fill the tank all the way. When I unscrew the gas cap, there's a HUGE rush of air. I look into it and seems like a EVAP issue but without the engine problems. We take a trip for the weekend and that's when I notice the fuel efficiency is abysmal - not that it's great anyways in these vans, but I've driven one for 7 years now and know what to expect.

  
So tonight, we dropped the tank again, thinking that a line was kinked or we over-tightened the tank straps and constricted something. Not able to find any issue. All our connections are solid, hose clamps are firmly in place, no kinks in the line as far as we can tell. Any advice?

1nixlog,2020 Nissan Versa alternator issue. Need advice.,"Hey guys. Thanks in advance for any advice . I really appreciate it. Been having issues with what i thought(maybe wishful thinking? Lol) was the battery. Twice over the last week i had to jump the car dead in the driveway in the morning. Money was real tight so ive been trying to leave it running as much as possible once i got it going in the morning to try an limit it dying on me while i was out with it. In retrospect, maybe that added to my issues cause from everything i have been reading, it sounds like my alternator is shot. Well i guess i know that for sure now cause she up and died on me in the middle of a busy 4 lane road last night! I panicked of course and get trying to restart it which pretty much drained the battery im guessing. Only dash lights were on. Some passerbys helped me jump it to put it onto neutral and push me accross the intersection and onto a side street. But the power didnt last long enough to get the damn windows up so i left them down. Im hoping i dont have a family of raccoons living in there now!

Anyways, my phone was dead and i was broke, so i walked 6 miles home and left the car there. Obviously i need to get it towed and fixed but i had to wait til a paycheck went in today, which it just has, to (hopefully) be able to afford any of this. Now, as you can tell from this so far....i am no mechanic. But i am a handy guy and i have done brake repairs, oil changes, and transmission fluid changes, among other maintenance of various vehicles over the years. So im trying to decide if i should have it towed to my driveway and tale a run at replacing it myself. Money is a huge factor here ...in that i dont have much of it. If i had a shop that i have used regularly, that i trusted to not overdue it, i would prefer to do that for all the obvious reasons, but i dont have one. For things outside my wheelhouse, i used to use a friend of a friend, but he disappeared one day and is rumored to be in jail. Nice guy tho and a great mechanic, so a shame all-around. So i know this is very long and meandering but i guess my question to you the experts is, in a money-tight situation, given what i said above.....

1) do you think changing a 2020 nissan versa alternator is doable for a handy guy with limited experience? Ive watched videos on it and it doesnt look too crazy but since ive never done it, im sure it will be much more difficult then it initially looks.

2) if i were to get it fixed professionally, would it be better for me to buy the new alternator myself and would guys be alright with that? I say this cause just from some price searching i see that the average prices thru a shop are a lot more then if i were to buy it myself. And i am aware that there are differences in refurbished, new, oem refurbished, and oem new. Dont know if i trust that i am getting what they say, unless i buy it myself but maybe im just paranoid. And cheap. Lol. And i would imagine some shops might balk at me providing the part.

3) this one is crazy specific so most of you probably cant answer this, but i am in Morris county NJ. Do any of you have an idea of what i might be looking at price wise in this neck of the woods and i dont know whats allowed here or not, but have any recommendations?

I need to figure this out pretty quickly as we only have this one car for a family of 3. Plus i need to get it towed off that street ASAP, and i only want to pay for the one tow, so i meed to figure out if im getting it towed to my driveway or a shop, and if its a shop...i gotta figure out which one. So any help or advice is greatly appreciated.  I apologize for the length of this post. Im not good at getting my thoughts out succintly.

Alternators are common first larger repair job for people to do themselves. It probably won’t be easy, but there’s not a lot of damage that you can do with that job.

2) it depends on if the shop you’d use would buy a factory or aftermarket alternator. Aftermarket will save a chunk of money. Some shops will not install them though 

3) I don’t live there. But your alternator appears to be $200-$350 for aftermarket and $600 for factory. Labor is probably around 1-2 hours. The labor rate I’m really not sure of. Varies quite a bit depending on the local cost of living. A common number is $150 an hour. So you’re looking at $350 -$650 for an aftermarket alternator install. Roughly. Could be less. Could be more. A shop probably won’t give you a quote over the phone but if you can get there and walk in and ask they’d give you an answer"

Wide band O2s are a lot more sensitive and faster, so they cost a lot more. The last time I picked out O2s, it was a long time ago, but it was about $80 for a standard O2 and $450 for a wide band. Odds are the part is the majority of the price you were quoted in this case. This is a job you could probably do yourself, but I'll warn you that if an O2 is seized or you're in a rusty area, it can get real dicey real quick.

I have always had this code since I bought the car , at the time I was getting approximately 18mpg .With an aftermarket 02 Sensor.

Currently my gas mileage is very terrible , it's about 9mpg . 

When I just got the car, I could see the fuel trims (Short and long term) fluctuating , the air fuel ratio was also fluctuating . Now the trims are stuck at 1 and the air fuel ratio is stuck at 14:7 .... This indicates to me that something isn't right 

I have a feeling that the ECM isn't seeing the sensor at all.

I have checked all the fuses LAF, the air fuel ratio relay. I have followed the diagnostic process for the code in the Honda Workshop manual , everything passed and all indications points to replacing the sensor. I have done that multiple times and nothing seems to be working . Where I am currently it's practically impossible to get the OEM sensor, expect I import it from the US . 

I believe even if it's the aftermarket sensor, there should be some reading in the live data , like I used to get previously.

So the fuel trims and A/F readings you're seeing are the default values. Meaning the car doesnt like what its being so its using a pre-programmed value which allows it to run in a limp home mode. You are correct that those values are worthless to you in diagnosing the problem. You probably need a better scanner to see raw values. This is a normal function and does not indicate that the engine control module is the problem. In fact, its actually pretty rare for an engine control module to be bad. 

I have no idea what the wire colors signify in your set up. But if you have a 4 wire O2, you can usually figure it out without a diagram. Two wires will be the heater circuit. That should come on with the key and be around battery voltage. But it could also go away after a predetermined time or not be there based on engine temp. It could also be adjustable by the computer based on a lot of factors. Resistance readings through the sensor should tell you which two pins are the heater. The other two should be the O2 ground and O2 signal. Seeing the raw value with a  meter wont do you a lot of good as your meter averages its readings and an O2 switches faster than a meter can see. But you can check the wiring between the O2 and the computer to make sure there is no issue with the signals ability to reach the computer. 

If its an aftermarket sensor, I would also double check how its wired into the car. Maybe a wire is mixed up or maybe the connections arent good anymore. Especially if using crimp connection."

Basically there are 3 levels of breakage and your spark plug porcelain is at level 3 extraction. They also make a Carlyle Kit that contains the porcelain pusher and self tapping extractor.

1nioz4g,Can oil get trapped in the yellow hose of a manifold gauge set? Accidentally sucked PAG oil to vacuum pump 😭😭😭,"So, was trying to follow this method of getting PAG oil into the system through the manifold gauge using the vacuum from the system, but in the YouTube vid, the guy removed the high side Schrader valve and sucked it in there through a straw. My high side service port has the ball springs valve so I couldn't since I didn't know how to remove it. I tried the low side but there was no suction. I can't even remember what I did but somehow I sucked PAG oil and dye right to the pump.

I flushed it out as much as I could but no matter what, the oil window on the pump flows from the dye. Drained it and shot warm and hot water through it. A little 91 alcohol. Some solvent. I then put some vacuum pump oil in it to attempt to pull a vacuum. But first, I figured out how to get the PAG in the system using the manifold gauge. 

The issue now is the window on the manifold gauge set where you see the refrigerant going in has oil and dye in there constantly. I believe, because of this, mist is continuously coming from the vacuum pump. But it might be because the pump itself is messed up from the PAG oil. 

Car holds vacuum well over an hour. Hooked the gauge back up the next day and it was still at 30 inches of mercury. I should mention I replaced the compressor, condenser, expansion valve and a line/hose plus I flush the the lines and evaporator then blew it dry with compressor with an in-line filter 

Questions: 

1. Could the mist be from the flushing?

2. Is there a way to remove all the oil from the manifold gauge, if that may be the cause for continuous mist? 

3. Is it likely that having the system open for a prolonged time due to a large leak or replacing parts made the moisture that bad?

4. If I closed the high/low valves at the gauge and the pump continues to mist the same, could that mean it was just pulling from the yellow hose. (When I pulled a vacuum after replacing a line that had a large leak, I pretty sure I remember mist only coming out for a short while. And then it was clear of mist.

5. Is it likely the pump was still pulling a vacuum correctly regardless? Should I attempt to recharge? 

Thanks

What arguments or documentation help make a strong case with Kia (or the dealer)—for example, maintenance history, frequency of oil changes, proof that I’ve kept up with all required servicing, etc.?
Is there a chance Kia might consider a “goodwill” repair or partial coverage even though the warranty is officially over? If so, how should I approach that: who to talk to, what to ask for?

What are the best channels to contact at Kia (customer service, regional reps, etc.) or the dealership to maximize chances of a positive outcome?

What kind of evidence would mechanics recommend collecting (oil consumption logs, compression/leak‑down test results, photos/video of exhaust smoke, etc.) to support my claim?

Should I get a second opinion? How important is that?

What are the least expensive, reliable repairs in this scenario? E.g. replacing valve seals, piston rings, possibly gasket/seal work, etc. What tends to fail first on these Sportage engines?

Are there any aftermarket or remanufactured parts that are decent quality and more affordable?
* Are there any consumer protection laws that might help me given the small margin over warranty expiration?
* Has anyone successfully escalated to a corporate or regional office (not just a local dealer) and gotten concessions or coverage?

Thank you in advance to anyone who has had a similar issue or who can point me toward resources.

1niog3d,One hour in a brand spanking new Changan Deepal S07,"I love checking out new, powerful, cheap cars and had the opportunity to drive a [Changan Deepal S07](https://www.changaneurope.com/no/modeller/changan-deepal-s07) for an hour today. Sharing the experience here to sort my thoughts and discuss with like-minded car nuts. The company Changan is a whopping 163 years old, but is owned by the Chinese state now. Probably not a first choice for privacy minded people, I guess. Changan is making the Mazda 6e like Dongfeng is making the [Honda e:Ny1](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1iy43n6/same_same_but_different_comparison_of_seres_5/), so they're still entangled with legacy carmakers and have a decent reputation where they come from.

The first impression is good. The exterior design is a generic kid of its time, but pleasant enough. It's a very spacious car with a good fit and finish, really nothing to complain here. Everything fits and feels well. I can sit behind myself - not always the case at 1,90m, or 15 giraffe's spots and ¾ spider's legs in American metrics. My teenage kids need that kind of leg room especially. There's a lot of Tesla inspiration here, from the frameless doors that move the windows every time you open them, to wipers that work by screen selection or if you press the washer button. Shit ergonomics based on a screen are part of that experience, but there are a few good solutions coming with that poor choice: The EU-mandated plings and plongs can be turned off with a quick whipe-and-click, the rear wiper has a dedicated screen spot that you quickly learn to press without looking and most settings are sensibly located, at least. The dealer couldn't tell me how to turn off the radio, but it's easy enough to turn the volume down on the steering wheel. Unfortunately, the steering wheel buttons extrude so far out to the rim that it's quite easy to press them with big manly hands just holding the wheel in turns. In contrast to Tesla, the auto wipers work quite well, though, yet they lack sensitivity settings - they're a wee bit late for my taste.

In general, there are quite a few quirks here. At slow speeds, the car plays a selection of one of three very simple songs instead of a hum or generic engine sound. All three are tiresome and I managed to get enough of them in my one hour with the car. The windows roll down/up by pressing the buttons up/down...eh...yeah, we've seen this in some other Chinese cars like Voyah, but it's surprising every time. The boot can only be opened by screen or key, not not from the outside nor by waving a foot. Like a few other cars, this one does away with having an extra screen for essentials. For example, speed is only shown in the HUD and corner of the screen, blinker direction only in the HUD. So people who turn this feature off will struggle to have essential info in their visual field. What's really odd is that the car doesn't show the current speed limit. That's a first among modern vehicles for me!

The Changan shines in two important disciplines, though: It drives very well and there's lots of room. Among Chinese competitors, this might be one of the most competent rides I've been in. Not as silky smooth as a Seres 5, but very confident and saturated, ESP regulating the car elegantly and you see it all coming while never getting the SUV wobble BYD does. The traction control is marvellous compared to many similar cars, I only ever had the front wheels spin in tight corners; going straight, it was hardly possible to provoke anything. That said, the Changan motor has a meagre 218 hp/320 Nm. That's okay, but lacking compared to the aforementioned Seres that offers 600 hp for the same price. The interior space is well-laid out with a cavernous boot, good 2nd row and a 125 liter frunk. Unfortunately, the latter can only be accessed by opening the hood like you would to service your car, and you have to pull the lever twice - once won't ever do it, it's a safety function. I'd love to see this opening by a press on the car key instead, the hood mechanism is just too archaic for everyday use. The interior is available in a wonderful orange that would probably [make Doug DeMuro happy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXgrVbdetOk).

Bigger downsides are a very eager emergency brake - unless you already have your foot on the brake approaching a slowing car - there's no ¾ rear view from the driver's seat due to a massive C pillar, which the screen and 360° camera help make less pressing. It irked me that the car wouldn't let me change drive mode, a fault that the dealer would look into. There would also sometimes be an error message ""drive direction unadjusted"" when in park - it covers part of the screen and can't be (re-) moved. Strange is that the driver's seat has only 1 saved setting. The seat will revert to that every time you get out of the car (even if it is still technically ""running""), so having two drivers - like your spouse or kids or whatever - means you guys will fight over this one setting. Properly weird, and the dealer said he'd come back to me to check if the one car key and up to four phones you can use to access the car can also hold different driver seat settings. Reviewers have bashed the slow QC charging rate at 93 kW which is truly meh, but if you drive a lot, a 475 km WLTP car with barely adjustable seats is probably not your first choice anyway.

The final, big, shiny point in favour of this Changan is the price. It comes fully equipped at 400k NOK (41k USD, 35k EUR) including winter tires and a hook that can take 1.5t. All with a 7 year/160k km warranty. That's honestly a smoking good deal for a well-laid out, simple, family car.",0,1758044878.0,15,CarTalk,1758137575,2025-09-16 17:47:58,2025-09-17 19:32:55,"Santa_Hates_You (Score: 11): Looks cheap.

1niiohd,Steering wheel shake while driving between 25-40mph,"Hi guys,

I drive a Mercedes E Class Coupe C238 W213 from 2019 and last week I had my annual service, gearbox service and differential service done at a Mercedes Benz Independent Specialist garage. After I picked the car up from the garage I noticed a steering wheel shake while driving between 27 and 40 mph (no braking). It usually happens in 3rd 4th and 5th and when I shift up using the paddles it mostly goes away. For motorway speeds it’s fine, it’s just between 27-40. It’s also very intermittent, like it would probably happen 6 times out of 10 but it’s very annoying when it does happen.
Things I tried in order to fix the issue:
- replaced tyres
- Had all wheels checked for buckles
- Re Balanced all wheels (twice)
- Had a full wheel alignment done
Nothing’s fixed it, so my guess it is related to something they’ve done during servicing.

That way you know you have a good tire that will be there when you need it.

If the coolant overflow tank had too much coolant in it and was spilling out, there may not necessarily be a problem or a leak.

Was coolant mistakenly added to the overflow tank instead of the radiator cap for a top up? Coolant should be added to the rad cap first, but only when the engine is COLD. Once that is full, the level in the overflow can be set to the appropriate mark on the side of the tank.

Hopefully the mechanic used a pressure tester on the cooling system to make sure there are no leaks."

That does sound like an alternator problem to me. The car will still continue to run off the battery until it goes flat. Battery should be placed on a charger and not left dead or it can go bad and not take a full charge. 

If you have a way to measure the battery voltage when the engine is running, it should be between 13.8 to 14.2 volts to keep the battery charged and run the electrical loads on the vehicle. If less than that, it should be inspected/replaced. If the alternator mechanically fails, it can seize up and cause damage to the drive belt. Hope this helps!

My phone is on 6% I’m stuck in the middle of nowhere at 3 am without a paddle.

Tldr: car keeps sputtering to a slow. Don’t know why, can’t call a mechanic till they open in a few hours 


Driving with my lady and the car just starts slowing, I stick my eyes on the dash and the RPM tanks, shes sputtering to a stop. But she doesn’t, she keeps going. I tell the lady to turn back home. But we’re maybe half an hour or more from there. 

5 minutes later the sputtering is back with a vengeance and as we’re trying to get home we finally give in and head for a gas station. The sputtering was getting worse and there’s no shot we could’ve made it home with the car sputtering like that. 

So we get to the gas station and I pop the hood. I am immediately emasculated by the lack of anything immediately wrong and I just poked around for a minute and got nothing done. Now we’re sitting in a parking lot waiting to be able to call someone about it. Anyone online know what could be up? I’ve got nothing to do for the next four hours.

1niin89,Steering wheel shake while driving between 25-40mph,"Hi guys,

I drive a Mercedes E Class Coupe C238 W213 from 2019 and last week I had my annual service, gearbox service and differential service done at a Mercedes Benz Independent Specialist garage. After I picked the car up from the garage I noticed a steering wheel shake while driving between 27 and 40 mph (no braking). It usually happens in 3rd 4th and 5th and when I shift up using the paddles it mostly goes away. For motorway speeds it’s fine, it’s just between 27-40. It’s also very intermittent, like it would probably happen 6 times out of 10 but it’s very annoying when it does happen.
Things I tried in order to fix the issue:
- replaced tyres
- Had all wheels checked for buckles
- Re Balanced all wheels (twice)
- Had a full wheel alignment done
Nothing’s fixed it, so my guess it is related to something they’ve done during servicing.

What could it be? Please give me some ideas
I’ll be going back to them in a few days.

1ni2kcf,2012 Honda CRV - Knocking from front left after brake job,"Update:

During a quick test drive this morning, The knock started getting a little worse, and then a new sound started.  It was not sounding good.  I parked and took a look,  THe left side seemed fine BUT the right side tire was missing 3 of the 5 lug nuts with the fourth about to fall off!

They must have fallen off for some reason, so I put an extra lug from the rear on, and limped home.  After removing the tire and rotor, my suspicion was confirmed.  There were still two bits off the drilled out screws protruding from the hub and preventing the rotor from sitting flush and allowing JUST enough wiggle to prob get the bolts lose. Re re positioned the hub so the stubs matched the holes meant for them, and put it back together.  Did the same on the drivers side, although those were pretty flush.  The rear rotors were aligned correctly because I reused some of the screws.



Hi All,

This is a 2013 Honda CRV, FWD, 100k miles.   I wanted my wife to get new brakes,   rotors, and tire rotation.  And since I did my own brake job on my G37, I decided to do this for the CRV as well.  New brake pads and rotors were purchased from rockAuto.

when I finally did the job this last friday, everything seemed to go pretty well.  In order to rotate the tires, I lifted the front left onto a makeshift jackstand,  and removed the tire.  The then started with the RL, replacing the brakes, rotors, and swapping the tire from the previous tire removed.  fronts to back and backs crossed to front.  So thew final work was done on the Front Left.   I was sure to apply brake lube all the spots recommended, including the sliding pins and such.   The only strange thing I did on the swaping the rotors, was that I had to drill out the two screws that screwed the rotor to hub.  Those screws were frozen in place on three of the 4 tires.  FL included.  I did not replace the screws as the holes in the hub were now full of the old screw.  Once complete, I did a little bit of driving and wear in the apply brakes.  Everything was smooth.

The next day, we drove around quite a bit, but in the evening while driving home, the wife said she was hearing some noise.  from the front left.  I was in the car and did not hear it at first.  but eventually it sounded like vibrating/buzzing sheet metal.  I figured it was the sheetmetal shield that sits behind the rotor.  I took the tire off, inspected and that piece did have the same tone when I hit it.  So a little light bend, and all was god.  The tire went back on.  All good...  Until it was driven for the first time today.  Now it is making the sound in the video.  The second part of the video shows what you can hear from outside.  I could not hear the knocking.  The wife COULD hear the knocking while I was filming.

The sound only starts while coasting.  It stops with throttle and braking.  It is in sync with tire rotation speed.

So I thought I would ask here first.  Some of my thoughts are CV joint. Did I mess something up while that corner was jacked up? Also, putting the tire back on the front left, it seemed that I could sort of continually tighten the lug nuts more than I would normally consider.  IT could have been my imagination, but perhaps the rotor to hub/tire has a gap?",1,1757981403.0,3,autorepair,1758137575,2025-09-16 00:10:03,2025-09-17 19:32:55,"darealmvp1 (Score: 1): Check the inside of the rim to see if anything is rubbing.

I was extremely confused at why as they shouldn’t need to be replaced soon. The noise was also centralized on my front left wheel which was strange. I was being lazy and kept driving enduring the noise. It was really bad today so I decided to have a look at them. 

At some point in the last few weeks, this poor guy (I believe it’s a field mouse) was taking a nap on my caliper unaware that he would be crushed upon me backing out of my driveway and over the next week his bones would dry and wedge themselves to create a noise very similar to worn brake pads under braking.

1niom3k,Can oil get trapped in the yellow hose of a manifold gauge set? Accidentally sucked PAG oil to vacuum pump 😭😭😭,"So, was trying to follow this method of getting PAG oil into the system through the manifold gauge using the vacuum from the system, but in the YouTube vid, the guy removed the high side Schrader valve and sucked it in there through a straw. My high side service port has the ball springs valve so I couldn't since I didn't know how to remove it. I tried the low side but there was no suction. I can't even remember what I did but somehow I sucked PAG oil and dye right to the pump.

I flushed it out as much as I could but no matter what, the oil window on the pump flows from the dye. Drained it and shot warm and hot water through it. A little 91 alcohol. Some solvent. I then put some vacuum pump oil in it to attempt to pull a vacuum. But first, I figured out how to get the PAG in the system using the manifold gauge. 

The issue now is the window on the manifold gauge set where you see the refrigerant going in has oil and dye in there constantly. I believe, because of this, mist is continuously coming from the vacuum pump. But it might be because the pump itself is messed up from the PAG oil. 

Car holds vacuum well over an hour. Hooked the gauge back up the next day and it was still at 30 inches of mercury. I should mention I replaced the compressor, condenser, expansion valve and a line/hose plus I flush the the lines and evaporator then blew it dry with compressor with an in-line filter 

Questions: 

1. Could the mist be from the flushing?

2. Is there a way to remove all the oil from the manifold gauge, if that may be the cause for continuous mist? 

3. Is it likely that having the system open for a prolonged time due to a large leak or replacing parts made the moisture that bad?

4. If I closed the high/low valves at the gauge and the pump continues to mist the same, could that mean it was just pulling from the yellow hose. (When I pulled a vacuum after replacing a line that had a large leak, I pretty sure I remember mist only coming out for a short while. And then it was clear of mist.

5. Is it likely the pump was still pulling a vacuum correctly regardless? Should I attempt to recharge? 

Thanks

1niikpl,Steering wheel shake while driving between 25 and 40mph.,"Hi guys,

I drive a Mercedes E Class Coupe C238 W213 from 2019 and last week I had my annual service, gearbox service and differential service done at a Mercedes Benz Independent Specialist garage. After I picked the car up from the garage I noticed a steering wheel shake while driving between 27 and 40 mph (no braking). It usually happens in 3rd 4th and 5th and when I shift up using the paddles it mostly goes away. For motorway speeds it’s fine, it’s just between 27-40. It’s also very intermittent, like it would probably happen 6 times out of 10 but it’s very annoying when it does happen.
Things I tried in order to fix the issue:
- replaced tyres
- Had all wheels checked for buckles
- Re Balanced all wheels (twice)
- Had a full wheel alignment done
Nothing’s fixed it, so my guess it is related to something they’ve done during servicing.

What could it be? Please give me some ideas
I’ll be going back to them in a few days.

Thanks.

Transmission Faults
A flashing D1 indicates that the automatic transmission cannot select or hold first gear properly, often due to an electronic or mechanical malfunction.

This is frequently accompanied by the vehicle entering ""limp mode,"" reducing performance to protect the system from further damage.

Wrench Symbol Meaning
The wrench warning light most commonly signals a required service, maintenance, or a powertrain malfunction like a transmission or throttle fault.

Flashing, rather than a constant glow, means the issue is urgent and could quickly lead to further damage if not attended to.

1ni649k,"I have a dpf fault code and air fuel reading which is off, where does the problem lie?","🚘 **Car:** Toyota RAV4 2010 2.2 D-CAT Diesel, 74k miles
🛑 **Code:** P2002 – DPF efficiency below threshold (Bank 1)
📌 Background: Just fixed P1497 (IAT high) which was simply an unplugged IAT sensor on the intercooler pipe. Car now drives perfect, but after \~1 hr highway run I got **P2002**.  It is saying I have no block and my dpf pressure is low and raises to around 3-7kpa with revs of around 2500rpm. So it seems normal maybe? My Af (air fuel) Sensor/oxygen sensor live data seems off, but could be the cause of my dpf fault code?

Code has gone when I cleared it but I’m trying to be proactive and try cover everything before it returns and car goes into limp mode no mechanics where I am so fixing on my own

📊 **Live Data (exact):**

* DPF differential pressure: **1.3 kPa**
* DPF PM block: **No block**
* DPF overtemperature: **Normal**
* DPF no activate: **activate**
* DPF thermal deteriorate: **Normal**
* AF Lambda B1S1: **0.0** (should be \~1.0 at idle)
* AF sensor learning value: **1.4 V** (should be \~3.0–3.3 V at idle)
* AFS current B1S1: **−128 mA** (should be −2 to +2 mA)
* Differential pressure sensor (corr): **−0.93 kPa** (should be 0.0 ±0.2 kPa with ignition ON, doesn’t change with revs or engine on)

---

❓ **My Questions:**

1. Does my bad AF sensor data (Lambda, voltage, and current all wrong) explain why I’m getting **P2002**, or is that unrelated?
2. With this exact data, what’s the **most realistic root cause** of the P2002?
3. How do I **systematically troubleshoot** this to make sure I don’t miss anything? (step-by-step checks I can do myself, no skilled mechanics here)
4. If the live data shows **low DPF pressure and no block**, how can I **confirm the DPF itself is not the problem** without removing it?
5. If it’s not the DPF, what should I check next — AF sensor, differential pressure sensor, wiring, ECU?
6. How can I **fix the AF sensor readings being off** and the **differential pressure sensor (corr) being stuck at −0.93 kPa**?,

Can a bad set of idlers and tensioner cause harm to the transmission? Could there be any link to the torque solenoid going bad? 

I had a slight squeal in my engine in January so my automotive shop replaced two idlers, a belt and the tensioner. Started the car up the next day and thought the engine was falling out. Took it in, they made some adjustments…still running rough. They replaced two solenoids. Still rough. The shop said they would replace all four parts from January. I am trusting they did even though it only sounded a bit better and there has continued to be this rough idling and hesitation in 1st-2nd gear, along with a lot of clunking and groaning. 

After that they began saying it’s just an old car and has squeaks, insisting that it wasn’t throwing any codes. This went on through late May. 

In August I had to take my car in for a body work estimate (hit a high curb and dented the front), but found it was also leaking fluid. The body shop says the leak is not related to the curb damage, that the torque solenoid has been bad for a couple thousand miles (not sure how one can tell that?). 

So, I’m curious if the continual idler/tensioner issue may have put too much strain on the transmission, specifically the torque solenoid.

1nis5bt,WHITE SMOKE,"Hi everyone, I wanted to get some opinions about a situation I’ve been dealing with for over a month. The car in question is a 2014 Mercedes A-Class, diesel, automatic. It all started when I saw the engine light on my dashboard come on, so I took it to the mechanic. The mechanic checked it and told me that the DPF needed to be serviced because it was clogged, so we did the DPF and the oil service. After that, he sent me a video showing that the car was emitting white smoke, and we needed to see what was causing it. The problem was said to be that the engine was pushing oil, causing the smoke. So, I was given two options: trade in the car or replace the engine. Since the engine wasn’t very expensive, I decided to replace it with a new one. However, even with the new engine, the problem persists. We’ve checked everything, all the water excess and the accumulations, but the car still emits white smoke. He told me that it’s simply residual, and by warming up the car, it should get better. In a few days, 3-4 days, it should decrease, but I still think the smoke is quite a lot. To clarify, when I start the car, no smoke comes out, or if there is, it’s very minimal. The first 5 minutes of driving are perfect, the engine has power, the car accelerates as it should, and gear changes are smooth. But after 5 minutes of driving, I start to see this white smoke, then I can tell the car doesn't drive smoothly ",1,1758053019.0,4,AskMechanics,1758137575,2025-09-16 20:03:39,2025-09-17 19:32:55,"Background_Exit_1336 (Score: 1): Check for co2 in coolant with tester

1niqz7y,"Hyundai went in for an engine replacement, came back with a number of new issues.","A couple months ago the engine in my Hyundai Tuscan crapped out on me. Turned out there was a recall on the engine that I was unaware of. Took it into a dealer to have it replaced. Things were already off as they weren’t communicating with me or providing me any estimates on timeframe (I know these things take time, but they didn’t offer a loaner and, at the very least, I need enough info to plan an alternative for work).

I received an inspection report with a number of recommendations, to be expected. None of them noted lights being on in the car or any other issues aside from some maintenance based on mileage. The maintenance at the dealership was 4x what I would have paid elsewhere so I declined.

After this, they went radio silent and after coming in directly a couple times I finally got through to a manager and the work was just completed last night. Came in today to pick up the car after waiting a while because “they weren’t sure if it was actually ready yet.”

Got in and noticed several lights on (DBC, AWD, ESC, ABS). Took it right back in. Their response and after a quick test, was that something may have happened to the speed sensor when the engine failed and that it wasn’t covered by the warranty but they could do a diagnostic and fix the problem. I declined noting that the work would be cheaper elsewhere. Also, keep in mind, these lights weren’t on before this point. Not even when it was getting towed to the dealership.

Started driving to the other shop and once I got up past 5 mph out of the lot, there was a lout grinding/hissing sound coming from the engine or somewhere under the hood. Brought it back immediately and they’re claiming that it’s just the brakes but they will look at it.

1nip2kj,Can oil get trapped in the yellow hose of a manifold gauge set? Accidentally sucked PAG oil to vacuum pump 😭😭😭,"So, was trying to follow this method of getting PAG oil into the system through the manifold gauge using the vacuum from the system, but in the YouTube vid, the guy removed the high side Schrader valve and sucked it in there through a straw. My high side service port has the ball springs valve so I couldn't since I didn't know how to remove it. I tried the low side but there was no suction. I can't even remember what I did but somehow I sucked PAG oil and dye right to the pump.

I flushed it out as much as I could but no matter what, the oil window on the pump flows from the dye. Drained it and shot warm and hot water through it. A little 91 alcohol. Some solvent. I then put some vacuum pump oil in it to attempt to pull a vacuum. But first, I figured out how to get the PAG in the system using the manifold gauge. 

The issue now is the window on the manifold gauge set where you see the refrigerant going in has oil and dye in there constantly. I believe, because of this, mist is continuously coming from the vacuum pump. But it might be because the pump itself is messed up from the PAG oil. 

Car holds vacuum well over an hour. Hooked the gauge back up the next day and it was still at 30 inches of mercury. I should mention I replaced the compressor, condenser, expansion valve and a line/hose plus I flush the the lines and evaporator then blew it dry with compressor with an in-line filter 

Questions: 

1. Could the mist be from the flushing?

2. Is there a way to remove all the oil from the manifold gauge, if that may be the cause for continuous mist? 

3. Is it likely that having the system open for a prolonged time due to a large leak or replacing parts made the moisture that bad?

4. If I closed the high/low valves at the gauge and the pump continues to mist the same, could that mean it was just pulling from the yellow hose. (When I pulled a vacuum after replacing a line that had a large leak, I pretty sure I remember mist only coming out for a short while. And then it was clear of mist.

5. Is it likely the pump was still pulling a vacuum correctly regardless? Should I attempt to recharge?

When he changed the alternator BOTH times, and both times the car seemed good and we thought the issue was fixed until the next morning when it happened AGAIN when he went to put the car in reverse / drive. It seems the alternator is putting out too much voltage and the battery gets super hot, but we cannot figure out why. When we used the multimeter with the car running, it stayed at a little over 14 and when all the lights / radio / headlights shut off the multimeter jumped to 18.

1nimhud,Did I get scammed?,"Hey guys sorry for the extremely long post incoming but I’m a pretty young guy and this is my first experience of this kind so idk who to ask. 


I recently bought a truck back in may, when I purchased the truck it came with a 6 month warranty.  2 months in I had a catastrophic engine failure due to  a known issue with these Silverado a collapsed lifter that ate the cam up. 

I used my warranty and they paid out 5,092. The next day I get a call they’re going to need $2,000 from me to order the engine before the work has even began because “the insurance only paid out $5,000 but the cost is $7,200”

At no  point was I ever given a written estimate, so I’m assuming I’ll just get at itemized list once I show up in person to pick the truck up. I send the 2K to get the engine ordered and work behind. 

A few days later I’m told I also need a water pump and motor mounts. The motor mounts will cost $352 and the water pump will be $260. Instead I went out and bought an AC delco water pump myself for 160 and the motor mounts for $48 all brand new with the warranty paperwork for both in the box. 

4 days go buy and on Saturday I’m finally told I can pick up the truck. When I arrive I’m told I have a balance of $562 for lubricants, oils, miscellaneous parts, etc. I work out a deal to pay the remaining balance on Friday they give me the paperwork and I leave. 

I’m driving the truck home and the AC doesn’t work. I pull over to look and the AC belt isn’t even installed so I text a photo to the shop and the owner tells me it came in with no AC belt on I was just getting outside air through the fan. 

I know this is a lie because I work in 95-103° weather and religiously abuse the AC every break, lunch break and my hour drive home. I being up the fact I purchased the truck 2 months ago and there’s no way it came with no AC and eventually they agree to replace the belt for me Monday. 

On Monday I arrive to get the belt installed and while it’s being installed the mechanic tells me I was supposed close out my balance today. Said no we agreed on Friday so I’ll close it Friday. He then says the owner told him something different and I told them well that’s not what he told me. 

I then go look at my bill and at that point I notice the date on the bill is for April and the engine on the bill says “5.7 engine” so now I believe they gave me the bill for another customer who had similar work done but on a 5.7 not a 5.3 and just reused the bill and forgot to change key info. 

I’m starting to believe maybe my whine was never swapped and only the heads and cam were replaced but I’m not sure how to verify this. 
I asked for an invoice or order number/proof of purchase that a new engine was ordered in case I need to use the 3 year/unlimited mile warranty they come with and have received no response only the photo below. 

But that doesn’t prove it was a new engine ordered for me or even that was the engine that went into my vehicle. I want that order info to call the supplier and verify or have it on file to hold them liable in the future if I need to

I know since no written estimate was ever provided that’s already a violation of California’s board of automotive repair. I’m also realizing that $2,000 charge to order the engine is most likely bullshit because the $5,000 my warranty company paid should’ve covered that. 

What should I do guy? I really think all they did was swap the heads and cam but charge me and the warranty company for an engine and I haven’t no clue how to verify that.

- Had all wheels checked for buckles
- Re Balanced all wheels (twice)

If the backflow valve goes bad, then the fuel pressure will bleed off as it sits. That means the fuel pressure has to build up from 0 when cranking which can take a couple seconds.

Bad bearings, I don't know how or why. I just replaced them about 6/7k miles ago but now they're fucking up my braking bad with immense steering shaking and felt response from the brakes and seat. Was told it was bearings and it aligns given when I'm slowing down I can feel it awkwardly rolling to stop. 

Now with that said, I've seen some threads swear that you can't do axles without that axle removal tool and others just use cheater bars with some just even using a torque hammer. 

I'm not about to drop 2k on a few hours of labor and $170 worth of parts. So what should I know about Gen 3 Ford Hub Assemblies? Google has been relatively useless. But with the units being sealed and pregreased I shouldn't have to do anything besides remove axle nut and replace the entire hub, no? The closest video on YT I could find was an F150 and that's what they did. Just removed axle nut and go for it? Biggest thing I'm concerned with is not knowing something small/ stupid that'll make for a wasted afternoon. 

Side question though, from what the shop told me the previous mechanic somehow improperly installed the hub assemblies and that's why I have such an outstanding premature failure, but like, how?

As for how tight the axle nut is.... You won't know until you try it.

They may have loctite on the nut.  That will melt out with just a regular propane plumbing torch.  A long breaker bar and a socket, and try it.

1nitd7n,Bumper repair - is it worth going through insurance?,"Someone’s crashed into my wife’s (29f) parked car outside our house. 2012 Toyota auris. Nothing special but it’s tidy, low mileage, and she only got it 10 months ago after recently passing her test.

Insurance is over £1500 a year as she didn’t want a black box and is still in her first year of driving.

Fortunately, the driver left a note with their number.

Is this worth going through insurance? Considering I’ve had 2 accidents in my 16 years of driving, both of which were no fault of my own. My insurance I think tripled and stayed high for a while. So considering her already crazy high insurance, I think we’d prefer to avoid it. What would you do?

Assuming we don’t go though insurance - I’ll contact some local body shops. However if I can find one nearby & well reviewed, I really don’t fancy spending time shopping around for a quote so would rather just go with them. So if anybody could shed light on what they think this would cost, it would be good to hear.

As far as the law is concerned, semi-automatics are no different to torque converter (traditional), dual clutch (goes by DSG, PDK, DCT, Powershift, etc. they're all brand names for the same tech) or CVT gearboxes, so you can drive any car. As long as it only has a throttle pedal and brake pedal, you can drive it. 

Semi-automatics are generally terrible, or at least the old ones are. My only real world experience with them are early models (2000-2005). They're slow to respond and the shifts are pretty jerky. I'm sure newer models have sorted this out.

Reliability has never really been a problem for single clutch autos/semi-automatic gearboxes. But I would recommend neither of those cars. I'd personally go with a Toyota Auris automatic.

1nin4ey,Help a son before he goes mad: choosing an electric car for non-car-parents under £17k,"Hallo,

My parents are looking at getting an EV for £17k or less and max 20k miles. If we were to move the budget up any further, they’d just get the Volvo XC40 – they were leaning towards that before I asked them, *“If it was hard cash in your hand, could you pay the extra £7k?”* The answer was no. As neither of my parents are car people, but they do plan to move to the countryside in the next couple of years, so they’ll need a car with decent range – especially as my mum has a tendency to put the air con on full blast.

The kids have all left home, so it doesn’t need to be a family car – just something reliable that will last the next 7–10 years . I showed them the Hyundai Kona and Kia Niro. They’re not big fans of the Kona’s look, and the Niro’s price is pushing close to Volvo territory. They don’t want a Tesla either.

They like the 2022 and 2023 versions of the Citroën ë-C4, Peugeot e-208 and e-2008 (they’ve had Peugeots before, which lasted well with little issues – but I don’t know if that carries over to the electric models). They also like the DS 3 Crossback E-Tense. The problem is, all of these are only rated three stars on *What Car?* and I don’t want them ending up with something rubbish but I do think I may be over thinking it.

What they want is a car that will last, with a nice interior. They’re not doing long journeys, so a real-world range of 160 miles or more would be fine.

I drive a Mercedes E Class Coupe C238 W213 from 2019 and last week I had my annual service, gearbox service and differential service done at a Mercedes Benz Independent Specialist garage. After I picked the car up from the garage I noticed a steering wheel shake while driving between 27 and 40 mph (no braking).

Things I tried in order to fix the issue:
- replaced tyres
- Had all wheels checked for buckles
- Re Balanced all wheels (twice)
- Had a full wheel alignment done
Nothing’s fixed it, so my guess it is related to something they’ve done during servicing.

1nifonw,Coolant leak - carshop wants us to wait 3 weeks to diagnose?,"Would really appreciate any advice because i have no clue right now. We (my dad and siblings) were on our way back home from a 2 hour trip yesterday and the red warning light came on saying ""switch off engine and check coolant level"" so we did that and it was lower than normal. Topped it up with bottled water and drove to the nearest service station and bought universal coolant of a similar colour (pink/orange). The warning still came on and as we were driving again, the engine temp got high to the point of overheating. So we pulled over again and called RAC. We checked the resevoir again and it had gone down rapidly so it was most likely a leak.

Took forever, but we got towed by the national highways to the service station on behalf of RAC and because it was late we decided to take onward travel and go home by taxi and have the car towed home. I think this was a mistake now as they didn't diagnose it and again had it towed by a 3rd party. Should've had it towed to a garage but we didn't know it was a coolant leak then.

We have extended warranty with carshop (as well as breakdown assistance) but they want us to wait 3 weeks just to diagnose the problem! And also have us drive it to them somehow even though we told the person on the phone it's a leak.

My guess is you have something similar - a hose or tank has perished or come loose. I think if your car was chugging coolant into the cylinders, you would notice some other problems.

I diagnosed my Z4 by making sure the coolant tank was full and then driving round my house in a loop for about 20 mins to get it hot. Parked up and had a look under the bonnet with a torch. It was immediately obvious where the leak was. I suspect you could do something similar to narrow down roughly where it's coming from, and then you can probably find out the likely part from some googling - people on the internet will very likely know the cooling layout of your car and it shouldn't be difficult to find the info

However as I now have much more cashflow ive been eyeing up a few cars with much bigger engines, more specifically the bmw e39 530i/530d estate with the 3L M54 or M57. The reason for this being they are extremely comfortable, im quite tall and fairly slim build and my arse goes numb after sitting in alot of econoboxes for more than a few hours at a time. In addition to this i have some issues with legroom where my knees will hit alot of small hatches steering wheels unless the seat is all the way back and the small storage space and space for other passengers isnt that great.

On the other hand, the e39 estates gigantic boot and plentiful legroom is a huge upgrade. Its comfort is like gliding through the air on a magic carpet, also the car has smooth power delivery and is one of my favourite cars to look at with some of the most iconic bmw styling of all time. I also have a love for wooden accents in interiors which we just dont see anymore apart from in the ultra luxurious models of today.

I will be doing alot of motorway miles averaging about 120 a day so being able to cruise in comfort and with elegance of a massive estate is ideal.

Admittedly insurance companies arent as fond of this idea as I am and im struggling to get any quotes. I wouldnt mind paying up to 15K a year for insurance since if my wallet is going to get twatted then I might as well enjoy it, yes its more expensive but money comes and goes and I want to own one of these cars before emmisions regulations take over and make it less feasible to own a petrol/diesel car. but I cannot find any quotes at all which is infuriating.

I’ve clocked up ~50,000 miles in that time, mostly motorway (London ↔ Sheffield twice a month, plus trips often out to Plymouth, Newcastle etc.). I need something larger now (roof, boot space, dogs, camping gear etc.) — two large dogs, gear for races in France/Belgium/Germany etc.

Here’s where I’m currently at:
	•	Lease offer: New Audi Q5 on PCH for £700/month + £700 deposit.
	•	Other car at home (Fiat 500e 24 kW, 2022) handles local stuff without dogs.
	•	Key needs:
 • Large boot & roof capacity for camping gear and dog space
 • Good on long motorways, reliable at high mileage
 • Reasonable ongoing running / servicing costs (fuel, insurance, maintenance)
 • Prefer premium build if possible, but willing to compromise for value

⸻

Questions / what I’d love feedback on:
	1.	Is £700/month for the Q5 too much, given the usage & mileage I’m doing?
	2.	Would an estate (used or nearly new) give better value over 3-5 years for someone with my usage?
	3.	What make/models should I be looking at if prioritising: space, motorway comfort, long-life, dog-friendly load area + roof carry?
	4.	Should I lean more toward buying / HP rather than leasing / PCH given the mileage and wear/tear (with dogs etc.)?
	5.	Any gotchas folks with similar situations have experienced (excess mileage, depreciation, servicing premiums etc.)?

1nicxl8,Stick or Twist…,"Hi everyone 

Reaching out for some opinions…

I have a 2015 Astra which is served me well and I have an electric car as the family car..

One part of me says upgrade the Astra but do I go petrol or electric as the prices for cars seems to all be the same.. if I look at a 5 year old bmw with 12 month warranty off of bmw it’s £20k, if I look for something cheaper but still with some performance it nearly always ends up being 20k.. now the sensible side of me says keep the Astra as I only use it to go down the tip in or town but after driving the electric I feel it’s literally standing still when I drive it - I don’t use it for work so sits on the driveway 

Should I be listening to the devil 😈 on left shoulder that says waste £20k or listen to the sensible devil on my right shoulder ?

Or is there other cars that do have some performance that are in the 5yr old low mileage category that I’m missing ?
I looked at a VW Arton that was a little cheaper at £17k but anything you filter tends to end up being the same number even ironically a bmw i4 that is over 60k new but on bmw approved used it’s £25k and only a few years old ??? 

Or sit and wait and see what the car market does … 

Strange post but it’s bugging me especially as guys do love a toy … I looked at motorbikes as a toy but it seems the insurance is ridiculous for a superbike these days … but I can go and buy a M135 and only pay another £50 a year on my car insurance - weird even if I try and put the bike as TPFT it won’t even quote me 🙄

As an adult I’ve been to many car shows and have owned many cars, many of which have been modified.

I’ve just finished watching the latest Top Gear video on YouTube, the Hypercar Boss Chat! Great video, fascinating insight, but my most interesting takeaway was that the CEO of Koenigsegg and the CEO of Singer both said quite firmly that EV’s are the far superior option for a daily driver, with the Singer CEO going as far as actually owning a daily driver EV which he said he absolutely loves.

📌 Background: Just fixed P1497 (IAT high) which was simply an unplugged IAT sensor on the intercooler pipe. Car now drives perfect, but after \~1 hr highway run I got **P2002**.  It is saying I have no block and my dpf pressure is low and raises to around 3-7kpa with revs of around 2500rpm. So it seems normal maybe? My Af (air fuel) Sensor/oxygen sensor live data seems off, but could be the cause of my dpf fault code?

Code has gone when I cleared it but I’m trying to be proactive and try cover everything before it returns and car goes into limp mode no mechanics where I am so fixing on my own

📊 **Live Data (exact):**

* DPF differential pressure: **1.3 kPa**
* DPF PM block: **No block**
* DPF overtemperature: **Normal**
* DPF no activate: **activate**
* DPF thermal deteriorate: **Normal**
* AF Lambda B1S1: **0.0** (should be \~1.0 at idle)
* AF sensor learning value: **1.4 V** (should be \~3.0–3.3 V at idle)
* AFS current B1S1: **−128 mA** (should be −2 to +2 mA)
* Differential pressure sensor (corr): **−0.93 kPa** (should be 0.0 ±0.2 kPa with ignition ON, doesn’t change with revs or engine on)

❓ **My Questions:**

1. Does my bad AF sensor data (Lambda, voltage, and current all wrong) explain why I’m getting **P2002**, or is that unrelated?
2. With this exact data, what’s the **most realistic root cause** of the P2002?
3. How do I **systematically troubleshoot** this to make sure I don’t miss anything? (step-by-step checks I can do myself, no skilled mechanics here)
4. If the live data shows **low DPF pressure and no block**, how can I **confirm the DPF itself is not the problem** without removing it?
5. If it’s not the DPF, what should I check next — AF sensor, differential pressure sensor, wiring, ECU?
6. How can I **fix the AF sensor readings being off** and the **differential pressure sensor (corr) being stuck at −0.93 kPa**?,
