1og5oy4,Honda dealer wants $8.6k for a transmission leak on my Civic — am I getting ripped off?,"
Hey everyone,

Got a 2013 Honda Civic with about 139k miles. Took it to the Honda dealer for a leak and the tech confirmed it’s coming from the transmission case. They pulled the shifter linkage cover and said no leak there, but found a bad fluid leak from the intermediate transmission case gasket.

Dealer says I need:
	•	Reman transmission (code BY001) – around $6,205
	•	Rear main seal (EN19) – around $2,445
Total quote: about $8,600 😬

They’re basically saying it’s bad enough that it’s not worth just resealing.
Car drives fine otherwise, shifts smooth, no codes.

Before I drop that kind of money —
	•	Is replacing the whole transmission actually necessary?
	•	Can a trans shop just reseal it cheaper?
	•	Are these prices normal for dealer work?
	•	Or am I better off selling it / driving it until it gets worse and topping off fluid for now?

Appreciate any advice or real-world experience with this kind of leak.

1og5b3q,Timing chain stretch symptom?,My 2011 VW 2.0 TSI sometimes has a sudden moment of power loss under full throttle and then continues fine. Idle seems to be a bit rough and it has thrown codes for low fuel rail pressure. I’ve changed most of the high and low fuel system over the last 2 years so all parts are relatively new. Could it be timing chain related? This engine is known for having tensioner issues. Wouldn’t I get timing related codes? The high pressure fuel pump is run off the engine timing so it could make sense? Any thoughts before I spend £2k on a timing chain.,1,1761433452.0,4,MechanicAdvice,1761507151,2025-10-25 23:04:12,2025-10-26 19:32:31,"Infinite-Jury-4167 (Score: 2): It’s best to get this diagnosed properly from an independent specialist you trust.

This is the best video on it all here:  https://youtu.be/L5EvMjoeMvU?si=K2YcuAKr-2IL3dAC

On my previous 2011 MK6 GTI the chain, tensioner, guides etc cost me £1300 so £2k seems way too much! 

If you have replaced fuelling parts and didn’t use originals to save money they won’t last as long (if it were to be any of those items and not the chain)

Other things could be leaky injectors, carbon buildup, air leaks, PCV failure, intake flaps, rear main seal leak - there is just too many things to guess.

1og4pil,Issues with my VW Beetle / Fuses,"Hi all,

First time here, not well versed in car maintenance, but in this economy I’m trying to be.

Couple of issues with my 2009 VW Convertible Beetle that I’m trying to figure out. Most seem electrical and I’ve been told I might have a power drain after a battery went out only a year in.

Here’s the list and what I’ve been up to:

Main issues are that the driver window won’t roll and button seems dead - power locking seems slow too. Hatchback won’t open or respond and button seems dead. Trunk won’t open with internal switch or on the fob. 

I understand the trunk especially might be a whole different issue, but today I was focused on the window and hatchback. Everything pointed to checking the fuses first but as soon as I did I was more confused.

I’ve attached the images from my car, including the car and my fuse box. I was looking at 30 and 38 as possible culprits when I realized - the fuses seem to be all f-cked? All of these issues are recent and I’ve never touched the fuse box, so I haven’t changed anything. 

Using the online source linked below and my manual, it seems that some things are lining up. Any insights? Could this be the power drain issue? 

Thanks all

That's what the steering rack uses to turn your front wheels, and it's also the main thing that gets adjusted when doing an alignment. 

It should be pretty much perfectly straight. Yours is severely bent, which shortens its effective length and pulls the toe angle of that wheel really far inward. That kind of bend only happens when there are really hard impacts, so it's also structurally weakened. It absolutely needs to be replaced, but the good news is that it's a fairly straightforward repair that shouldn't be very expensive, especially if you were to do it yourself. That alignment will also really need to be done once it's replaced.

The vehicle is 2017 Mazda 6 GL Wagon, 2.5L engine with automatic transmission

**The Problem**:  
Whenever I accelerate (either forward or reverse), I hear a distinct ""ping"" sound coming from the front left wheel area (audio in video). The sound only occurs when:

* Starting from a complete stop
* Maneuvering in parking lots at low speeds
* Going uphill

Importantly, the noise does not occur when:

* Driving normally at speed
* Going over bumps or potholes

My theory is that, since the sound happens during acceleration but not over bumps, I suspect it might be related to the axle/CV joint rather than suspension components, but that's just a guess. I have also checked if the wheel is properly tightened (it is) and if the brakes where ok (they are, and the rotors and pads are new on all four wheels).

The previous owner disclosed that the car was in a front-left collision and was repaired at a reputable shop. He mentioned he never experienced this issue though. The car otherwise drives perfectly - tracks straight, shifts smoothly, and has no engine codes.

How would you recommend diagnosing this? What could be causing this ping sound?

1ofyvg9,2006 Camry blown head gasket,"I’m helping a friend change his nephews head gasket on a 2006 Camry with the 4 cylinder with 167k miles. 

I’m used to working on fords. 

What are the best brands and the brands I need to stay away from when getting parts?

I was planning on doing head gasket, head bolts or studs, intake manifold gasket, possible exhaust manifold gasket, valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, front cover seal, timing kit, water pump, thermostat and thermostat housing gasket. Possibly resurface the head if needed. Anything else you recommend?

I’ve looked on rock auto and I’m not seeing any oem gaskets. I was going to go oem on head gasket, valve cover gasket, and oil pan gasket if you guys agree. What other gaskets should I get oem? 

Looking at the head gasket kits on rock auto they have a whole slew of gaskets. Is it necessary on these to replace the valve stem seals and everything in the kit? If I got the kit with the valve cover gasket in it, would it be alright? I’ve never had luck with aftermarket valve cover gaskets. They don’t seem to last long. I see the kit has front cover seals, maybe an egr gasket? I’m not sure what everything else is without having the car and looking for it.

Also the timing kits have a bunch of parts. Oil pump gears, VVT sprockets, VVT solenoids, cam sprocket, crank sprocket. Is it necessary to replace all that? Or just go with a basic timing kit. I’m more than capable and have all the tools unless there’s a special tool required…

Is there anything I’m missing? 

Thank you guy! And maybe gals!",1,1761416909.0,4,MechanicAdvice,1761507151,2025-10-25 18:28:29,2025-10-26 19:32:31,"Optimal_Cupcake2159 (Score: 1): Those 2AZ-FE engines don't have EGR valves, so that's one thing that won't need doing at least. I can't say much for brands, but aftermarket is usually fine, just don't go for bargain basement stuff. 


You'll probably need to check if the head is warped. There's a limit on how much can come off the heads, since it can start to change how valve clearance and timing works on these engines. 


Unless there's very good reason for new timing components, that might not be necessary. New water pump and thermostat probably wouldn't hurt.


167k is pretty low miles for a Camry, even for the 2AZ-FE, I'd be surprised if the timing stuff needed replacing.


But the amount of head warpage if there's any could shut the whole show down, I'd start from there. If it wasn't ran overheated though, it should be fine.

1ofu5jn,Looking for a second opinion,"Brought my truck into a shop last week for brakes and a slow leak of something from the engine area because I’m moving and wanted to make sure it was safe to tow with. Shop ID’d the leak(s) as the transmission and oil pan gaskets and got to work replacing them. The replacement oil pan gasket still didn’t seal so they held the truck for a few extra days to get more and also did some free work on the driveshaft (after they noticed the U-joint was nearly shot). The new gaskets still didn’t seal so they replaced the entire oil pan and a full week after I dropped it off, I finally got the truck back. 

The next day (yesterday) I ran some errands around town and then hauled my trailer to the house to start loading it with my stuff. About mid afternoon, my friend and I took my old couch in the trailer to the dump and came back to keep working. I don’t recall noticing any leaks or drips at this point but I wasnt paying extra close attention either so it’s possible I missed a small one. About 3 hours after that, we called it a day and I drove my friend back home and dropped the trailer off at the storage lot. As I pulled out of the driveway I noticed a puddle right under where the engine had been. When I got back home I went to check the puddle and realized it both smelled like oil and was larger than I had thought. I checked a small area where it pooled and saw that it was red (transmission fluid I assume). There was no puddle where the truck had been parked before the dump run (the engine was over different spots each time). I parked the truck in my driveway and checked underneath and found some small drips coming down from different areas around the engine and transmission. I checked it again two hours later and the small puddles under the drips had grown but at a waaay slower rate than what would’ve been needed for the big puddle from earlier.

I took the truck back to the same shop first thing in morning (and confirmed that the puddles hadn’t really grown overnight) to see what they could find. The mechanic checked it and said the new oil pan had a drain plug that hadn’t been installed correctly so he fixed it real quick and topped off the oil and transmission fluids. The transmission barely needed anything apparently but the oil was down around half a quart. He mentioned there was still a minor drip from the front and back of the oil pan but said I should be safe to tow my trailer Monday. He recommended I swing by before leaving just have the oil level double checked before I set off and said I should get it looked at in more detail once I get to my new city.

I just want some reassurance I suppose that I’m not gonna burn up the engine or something towing a trailer 800+ miles across two days. The inconsistency with the leak is what really had me worried. The mechanic said it should be fine as long I keep the oil level topped up if it leaks during the trip.

1oftvbn,SOS discontinued part ‘92 GMC G3500 Box truck,"Hey everyone,

Tl;dr My outer bearing welded itself to the spindle on my trucks knuckle/spindle assembly. Spindle is mostly okay - but I’d rather replace it, resleeve the spindle, or put my box on an entirely different vehicle as a last resort. Called a bunch of places with no luck, looking for other options that maybe I’m unaware of


I’m on a road trip and I’m stranded in Idaho until I get this fixed. Once I source or fix this knuckle, I’ll upgrade the front end components at the same time (so don’t comment on how bad everything else looks haha)


Here’s the full story: 400 mi into road trip, odd noise starts. I don’t have the experience to know what was happening but it was obviously bearing failure. Climbing a hill out of Coeur D’Alene Idaho, feel a pop and car pulls to the side. I pull off the road with the wheel screeching extremely loud. Lift it, remove the wheel, nothing visible. I slowly roll off the highway, wait a few hours, then roll back into town. I stopped at an auto parts store (now sure I destroyed my bearing) and removed my hub. The outer bearing was welded to the spindle. I had to cut it in 4 places and hammer it off. 

The diameter of the outer portion of the spindle is now around 1.034-6” but the new bearing is 1.026” and the spindle is gouged. Taking that much material off the spindle and keeping it round is impossible without a machine shop - none of them have returned my call. 

I’ve found the part number online and have all the vehicles it was on (it’s a short list) and I’ve called 20 different salvage yards around the US with no luck so far. I’m waiting to hear from two of them. I’ve tried posting in the classic car parts forum but the 1988-98 forum hasn’t had a post in years. I’ve posted to Facebook and had over 500 people respond to my post in the town I’m in, but nobody has had the part. 

It’s part number 475084 for GM https://www.gmpartsgiant.com/parts/gm-knuckle-asm-strg-r-h-475084.html",1,1761404848.0,9,MechanicAdvice,1761507151,2025-10-25 15:07:28,2025-10-26 19:32:31,"Kootsiak (Score: 2): If you can weld or know a good welder, [there are aftermarket billet spindles that have to be welded in](https://www.wideopendesign.com/off-road/axles-and-components/spindles-and-wheel-hubs).

I looked into this after having the 14 bolt on my 2500HD weld it's bearings to the spindle, but I ended up grinding off most of the melted bearing race, finished it off with hand files over the course of two days and put new bearings in it. Then I kept driving it for another few years.

I'd suggest:

Transmissions- manual transmissions and the introduction of the synchro into common use, the introduction of the automatic,  the introduction and common use of the CVT, and the phase out of transmissions in EVs

Differentials- overview, introduction of the limited slip differential, a look at AWD

Carburators to mechanical fuel injection to throttle body injection to MPI systems, ending in direct injection into the cylinder instead of above the valves

Bearings and oil, from Babbitt type to modern

Leaded gas and how it helped the engines of the time but was bad in all kinds of other ways

Tires from inner tube to bias ply to radial

The rise of computer technology and complexity, sensing, and how it helps safety

1ofo9mu,BMW E46 330i hesitates and stalls when warm,"Hi all,

  
I recently bought a 2000 BMW E46 330i (manual transmission) and only managed to drive it for about an hour and a half before it started having issues.

  
The car starts perfectly and drives mostly fine whilst the engine is cold, although there's a very slight hesitation when accelerating (noticeable, but nothing major)

However, once the engine warms up, the throttle response becomes noticeably delayed (I estimate a couple hundred milliseconds but it feels like it takes half a second or more). If I press the accelerator quickly, the RPMs drop sharply and the engine sometimes stalls. It still starts fine when warm, but the throttle behaviour changes completely.

  
If I ease onto the throttle very gently (and slip the clutch a bit) I can drive it somewhat normally. But if I try to take off quickly in first gear, the RPMs drop and the car either bunnyhops or stalls. It's getting a bit embarrassing in traffic because it takes a few extra seconds than it should just to get moving from a stop plus there's a lot of revving.

  
The same thing happens if I lift off the gas completely and then get back on it quickly - like when trying to rev-match or accelerate hard. The engine bogs down badly before recovering. Testing this in neutral shows the RPMs dipping to \~400 before recovering and revving ""normally"" again. I have also noticed the oil-light popping up on my dash around this time or right after turning the car back on when it stalls (I assume the low RPMs is causing weak oil pressure?)

I haven't had a chance to do any proper diagnostics yet, and I can't take it to a mechanic for another couple of weeks. I'm hoping to get some advice or ideas on what could be causing this issue. I suspect the MAF sensor or a vacuum leak but that might just be wishful thinking.

I bought the car from an older gentleman who claimed it had been regularly maintained and that he'd owned it for three to four years. After the purchase, I discovered he'd actually only owned it for about three to four months. Because of that, I can't really trust any of the information he gave me about the car (i.e maintenance or how well it drove during his ownership)

The car drove ""fine"" for the first couple of days after I bought it. It had also been on a long drive of around 250km before the sale, and the issue wasn't present when I first got it. I believe it was raining at the time that this issue first popped up...

Sorry if this explanation is a bit messy. I really appreciate any help or suggestions. Thanks!

Just noticed today, there is a small dent roughly the size of a US quarter on the driver side door. Definitely smaller than 2 US quarters.

Given the placement, it’s impossible I did it myself. It was either there prior to me taking the car (my fault for missing it) or it was caused by somebody opening their car door recklessly and hitting my rental. There’s no paint damage and I didn’t even notice until I looked back at my parking job and the sunlight was hitting it perfectly. 

As a first time car renter, I’m understandably quite rattled even though i myself did not cause any damage, not that it matters regardless. I know enterprise has a damage circle to gauge whether it’s wear and tear or not.

Am i screwed? Should I report this or just let it go until return and see if they notice ? I’ve had the car in my possession for less than 24 hours if that makes a difference.

With four post starter solenoids, the big 2 are B+ in and out. The small 2 are key+ in to engage the solenoid, and B+/cranking power out to the coil. As, the ignition switch loses ignition power when cranking.


So yes, you are losing power when cranking. The generator is not active when cranking either, if the system is wired correctly. The generator itself has nothing to do with starting, or running the engine. There is no vehicle harness, or need for a genetic to provide power on a bench test. 


You can remove the vehicle wiring from the equation completely, and should be able to get it to start and run properly. Or, you can start with whatever you have now, and verify your signals through the switch as is. "

Sure, the 3800 has been swapped into lots of different vehicles and it's old enough there isn't any substantial engine/chassis module integration that would cause major issues. 


That being said things like this are generally a labor of love, where the person doing it is writing off their own time as the cost of the hobby. If you want to just drop the car off and write a check, and pick up a driving car in a few weeks from a performance/specialty shop (no normal auto shop will touch a job like this) you could easily be into it for 10k if you want it to look/drive as if it came that way factory. If you want to rebuild the engine/transmission before it goes in it add any upgrades that will also cause the bill to climb very quickly.


Do what you will but keep in mind often times people that want performance from their car have it in their mind that they should mod the car they have since they already have it, and that's fine if you like the car that much, but just understand it's usually not saving you any money to mod what you have vs buying a car that is a better performance oriented platform when you are talking taking stuff to this level.

I was about 5 minutes from home so I drove slowly but every time I hit a bump I heard a loud thud and also I head some like squeaking noises. I know absolutely nothing about cars so I called my dad and he didn’t seem to know either. I checked again this morning and none of the tires were flat and nothing seemed to look wrong with it.

All plugs out or just removing one plug, checking that cylinder, reinstall the plug and move on? 

I was at some tech event years ago and the instructor made a solid argument about not putting as much emphasis on max compression. Pull all the plugs so the engine spins as fast as it can. Compare compression readings on the same number of compression “hits.” (I usually stop cranking on the fourth “hit.)You’ll hear each time whichever cylinder gets compression. If the head gasket is blown, or the head is warped, or timing is off, you’ll find it much easier. 

I haven’t really checked max compression on an engine in 15 or so years. I doubt it’s a head gasket issue if it didn’t get too hot, but a chain guide can break, a vanos unit could be stuck, the fuel filter could just be filled with shit, or something completely unrelated to hot rodding around. I can’t really think of anything other than timing or fuel that would cause that many cylinders to misfire. 

Are there any other codes and what kinda scanner are you using? A lot of the little pocket ones don’t always get all the codes. Can you watch misfires on your scanner? (Focus on finding something different between the worst misfiring cylinder and a non misfiring cylinder)

1ofi5qr,HELP!! Is this PCV breather hose seated properly?,"I just replaced my air intake hose in my 2012 Honda Civic EX 1.8L and from every video I’ve watched it seems like they get that PCV in deeper but I just physically cannot put it in further. (I also fixed the clamp after I took this pic I know it wasn’t on right). My car has been cranking more/stalling after a few seconds. Sometimes it won’t catch at all. The air filter was extremely clogged I replaced it along with the intake hose bc there was a rip (which could’ve been from my partner yanking on the air filter box so I have no idea if it was there before the stalling or not). I cleaned the throttle body and EGR valve. I went to start it after all of this and now it stalls but with a thud so I’m hoping it’s just a result of the PCV not being fully seated. I took it to an auto repair shop before this and they replaced the Crankshaft sensor bc the check emission light has been on and off for over 2 years now. The code was P0335. I think this is a separate issue of the stalling but the check emission light is also still on after the sensor replacement, maybe it just takes time to clear? I had a diagnostic scanner put to it over 2 years ago when the light first came on and was told it was nothing to worry about, unless something has progressed. Auto repair shop couldn’t tell me what was wrong after the sensor replacement and then I had a mobile mechanic come look at it and he said he believed it was carbon buildup, clogged Cat, or maybe even needs a new O2 sensor.

My truck has been making a strange noise that I can’t quite pinpoint. It sounds like it could be coming from either the belt or the radiator fan. I drove it about 2.5 hours last weekend to go camping, and near the end of the drive, I noticed the noise starting — though it was fairly quiet at that point.

Later that evening, when I started the truck again, the noise was noticeably louder. I checked the coolant level and found the reservoir completely empty. I accidentally refilled it with the coolant I use for my Honda, but I drained it right away, replaced it with the correct coolant, and bled the system properly.

After that, the noise did quiet down a bit. However, I’ve noticed that it’s still louder when I start the truck or when I turn left or right, and it’s not as bad when I’m driving straight.

1ofgezd,Question about fuel tanks and pumps,"I changed a fuel pump over a couple of weeks ago and have still been wondering what stops short circuits from happening inside and causing ignition/explosion.

The pump assembly has a wire going downwards that plugs directly into the pump, which sits surrounded by a plastic bubble, but is not entirely sealed from the bottom and the top is open. Kind of like a tall donut. There is a bucket shaped clip that holds up a rubber disc into the bottom of the pump base but the disc is not entirely round and would not stop fuel from coming up.

From this I'm just wondering if low level currented wire meeting with petrol fluid is not really a hazard, cause surely it's possible for fuel to slosh around a bit and have drops land in the top and go in the small 2mmx2mm squares of the plug where the wire connectors sit. Is this just not an issue? Let alone fuel rising up quickly from the bottom during incline driving, around the pump body and getting in where the wires are? It also seems that tanks have a mid-level-floor with a hole in it to reduce sloshing and also the pump sits partially down through the hole and relatively deep in the fuel. What if a few drops landed in multiple plug holts and 'connected' them, I would have thought that would definitely be a problem - or maybe just almost impossible to happen, a 1 in 500 million type incident.

Hello. I replaced my car battery after the battery light came on while driving. I got it replaced at an autozone. They tested the battery and said the alternator was good and charging but the battery needed to be replaced. After they installed it  the car wouldn't stay on. I had to start it about 3 times for it to finally stay on. However it would idle very rough. I decided to drive home. It would take a while for it to gain speed and it would almost turn off every time I had to stop. At home I let it idle for a while thinking it needed to relearn how to idle. But nothing. Connected a code reader and had misfire codes in cylinder 1 and 4

I took it to the mechanic and they clean the butterfly valve, replaced the spark plugs and coils, replaced the fuel pump and clean the catalytic converter. Still nothing. Drove it back home and now it doesn't even start. It cranks but won't start.

Any ideas?

1ofthfb,Can steering angle sensor cause so many issues with my 2005 D5 120kw Volvo v70?,"Hey everyone! 

Recently my V70 started acting up. First it started with anti-skid error message appearing, after that it was an ABS service required popped message, and after that it was several intermittent and seemingly random errors appearing, like the low oil pressure, transmission service, immobiliser, engine check light, limp mode activating and instrument cluster not working properly. The car also just doesn’t start from time to time (engine turning but not starting), this is usually fixed after few attempts. 
I hoped that it might be cause by faulty battery, but after swapping the old battery (which was pretty old and didn’t hold charge properly) for a new one, nothing has changed. 

Anyhoot, did diagnostics on it and this is what came out. My question now is: Could this really be cause by faulty steering angle sensor? Or is it more likely that it’s some larger system like the ECU? How would the steering angle sensor cause the car not starting for example? 

Any help is greatly appreciated! ",1,1761403903.0,3,AskMechanics,1761507151,2025-10-25 14:51:43,2025-10-26 19:32:31,"Interesting-Look-381 (Score: 1): Not the steering angle sensor.

My engine is a Z16SE and in a lot of 0-100 videos people tend to shift at 5500-6000rpm (according to the engine specifications, it reaches the max power at 5600rpm). But my car, after 4500 or 5000 rpms in first gear, the speed doesn't seem to increase much and the engine sounds louder in an unsatisfying way. It feels like the engine is begging for me to shift at 4500. But second, third and other gears can take 5000-6000rpms just fine. 

Is that an gearbox or clutch problem? My clutch is supposedly new from Sachs bought and mounted 2 years ago.

We took it for an oil change locally again today and the counter guy said they don’t carry that oil and none of his suppliers carry that oil because it’s a weird oil to put into trucks. Normally they just put 5W40. I asked him to check what was done when we were away and he said they put a 5W30 gas engine oil without even saying anything to us.

We are in the market for a new car, and we are thinking somewhere in the £15k-£18k range. We would be happy to go lower for something that fits the below however we don’t necessarily wish to go higher than £18k.

We are both auto drivers, and want something that has: (1) reliability, (2) infotainment/modcons; (3) decent MPG.

The daily commute is 15 minutes, but I work as a lawyer. I could be anywhere within a 2-hour radius 5 days per week.

As we have a growing family (5 and 2 year old), we knew that our time with the Yaris was limited.

We have looked at a VW Tiguan and Hyundai Tucson. We would be open to other cars, and unfortunately the better half isn’t a fan of Estate cars so that writes those off.

1og5wl3,Could someone explain car lease and hire purchase to me?,"I come from a priviledged background where both my parents were fortunate enough to be able to outright buy nice low mileage second hand cars. They also earnt enough to just pay the garage/petrol bills without really thinking, so we never talked about these things, and now I'm realising how ill-equipped for this I am!

I am now working for minimum wage and with more than £400 a month going out on a train season ticket, I am in no position to drop thousands on a reliable car.

I need to learn to drive and am very nervous about it, so am looking for an automatic gearbox to take out some of the stress. I can see the overall advantage of a hybrid monetarily but that does, of course, increase the price. Would a petrol hybrid (not a plug-in) make a massive difference to petrol costs? Again, I don't really have a sense of mileage/petrol use as I don't currently drive.

I don't understand the pros and cons of each agreement, particularly why you should choose one over the other? My partner has had a horrid run of luck with cars breaking down so we're also considering paying for a maintenance package for peace of mind, but is that really worth it considering how little I am earning?

I am looking to reduce my train season ticket outgoing, possibly to around £200 a month if I drive to work once a week, or I could reduce it to 0 if I drive to work every day. What would you recommend to a new driver? Is it good practice to do it every day or would that be too overwhelming?

hire purchase - you are basically buying the car, but split the payment over xx amount of months, with interest baying paid, say the car is worth 20k and you want to do it over 24 months, that will be 20k divided over 24 months plus interest, once paid off, you get to keep the car.

I would say, learn to drive a manual.  
If you have a manual licence, you can drive both auto and manual vs having a auto, you can only drive auto.  
Plus insurance are cheaper for people who hold a manual licence.

having a hybrid vs non hybrid saving, this comes down to how much driving you are doing and where.  
if you are doing mostly city and town driving and not really going to go above 40 miles plug in will be better as on a plug in tend to have about 40 millage on the electric motor when doing about 20/30 mph vs a non plug in hybrid is like a mile or 2. Also if you get a like a 1l small car like a Aygo, that will be better then a non-plug in hybrid as small engine and a light car.

my last car was a 1.4l turbo petrol and my current car is Auris hybrid 1.8l, the petrol car was better on fuel on the motorway but the hybrid is better when doing local driving.

if you plan to learn and get a car for work, you will need to look at the fuel cost, wear and tear, parking cost etc, which you find that the train is better. I need to go the office once a week i pay £6.10 for a tram ticket, if i was to drive, i will be driving in rush hour but the cost of parking will be around £8/9 per day.

Once you pass, drive to as much as you can, this you will build up experience.

1ofytz4,Timing belt or chain?,"Hi everyone

I'd just like to start with the caveat I have very limited knowledge of cars in general, but I'll try my best to properly explain the situation.

I bought a car two days ago (seat ibiza 1.4 se sport coupe 2013) and at the point of purchase I asked if whether or not it had a timing belt or a timing chain. As the car had 70k miles already. Due to partial service history he wasn't entirely sure until he ""checked"" and confirmed to the best of his knowledge  that it had a chain.

Although today I have been informed by some people that they believe it actually has a belt not a chain, and if it hasn't been done, then that it is something that due to the age and mileage, it will be ready for.

I am just curious if there is way to definitely know what it has, due to me having basically no service history to look through. And if it does have a timing belt, do I have a case to request a partial refund for potential costs due to being told at the point of sale it had a chain and not a belt. (I do like the car so I wouldn't push for a full refund, just an amount to cover the unexpected cost).

The only reason it's come to my mind is that I took it for a good drive today and I noticed a small ticking sound that got me thinking about stuff.

Any form of insight would be massively appreciated.

Thank you.

After catching up with my parents over the whole fiasco, my Dad has very kindly given his car to us as he’s been thinking of giving up driving for a while now anyway. So we’ve now got one car between us! A 2012, 2L Diesel Mondeo. For our second car this means that we now have a larger budget of £8k, and I quite like the look of several Toyota models so we’ll explore our options there. Thanks again! 

*Original Post*

On the app so sorry for the layout! Also I’ve come out of my lurking and actually logged back in for the first time in 3(?) years to ask for advice!

Both mine and my husbands cars have been written off in the same week. Mine, in an accident where someone went into the back of me. My husband’s failed his MOT in a massive way and the car is simply not worth the repair price. We’re not sure what to do next vehicle wise.

My car was a 2014 BMW 1 series, 1.6 diesel. I loved it for the great mileage and cheap tax, also super comfy. My husband’s car was a 2002 BMW M3, 2.5 petrol (absolutely not practical but he also loved it). 

We both had these cars before we met and now our circumstances have changed. We have a large dog and would both like 5 doors and a large boot to accommodate him. Also, we’re moving 80 miles away within the next couple of months. My husband will only go into the office once every 3 weeks, but I will have to commute a total of 160 miles every day until my contract ends in July. I will then be looking to commute no further than 5/10 miles. Our family and friends live near where we currently work so we’ll be doing the journey about once or twice a month. The commute for both of us will be mostly duel carriage ways/motorways but we are moving to the middle of nowhere. The local roads and walks are essentially potholes or mud. My BMW was so low it basically scrapped the bottom and front bumper the majority of the time there… 

Sadly, because of moving costs we only have £3k - £4 for each car and neither of us want one on finance. I appreciate the budget isn’t brilliant, and we have thought about having one car, realistically this wouldn’t work for us though! 

Any advice on what kind of car to get is really appreciated as it’ll have to be a car that’s good at multitasking. My husband was considering a 1.2L, manual Suzuki Swift. I don’t really mind, but something that has reasonable tax and good MPG would be a bonus.

Thank you in advance! 

EDIT: Wrong car! My husband’s car was a 2002 325i “M-Sport”, not an M3 (my mistake). He sold it to a garage on eBay who have the funds and means to repair it.

Option 2: Opel/Vauxhall Corsa F, 1.2 petrol with 75HP. This one is from 2021, unknown history since it’s imported from Italy. There is some slight cosmetic damage that needs to be fixed, but shouldn’t be that expensive. It has done 74000km (46000mi). This on is a 5-speed manual and the agreed on price is 6500€ (+about 500€ for cosmetics).

1ofmfsm,Is it worth buying my Cat N car back?,"Hello,

Long story short, a lady drove her car into 3 parked cars and wrote all 4 vehicles off.

At first the insurers said mine was fixable, but then they got in touch and said it was a total loss. I am negotiating the value they will pay out and hope to hear back soon.

I was shocked to hear mine was a write off since it didn't look too bad (compared to the others). To my knowledge, it had a punctured tyre, scratched alloys and body work, some dents and a missing wheel trim. I called back. They haven't given me a report despite me asking, but they said it is a category N and therefore none structural damage.

I can therefore buy it back if I was wish. I think I am looking at a value payout of approx £12,500 and can buy it back for £4000. I have sent one repairer pictures and they said they can repair it for £1500. I will also need to have it transported there.

Therefore my questions are:
- is it worth it?
- could the insurer be incorrect with their category and could there be structural damage or will they have given it a thorough inspection?
-similarly, should I be getting an independent inspection on the vehicle?
- am I likely to come up with issues in the future?
-does driving a category N car put existing insurance up?

For context, I wouldn't be able to buy this type of car for £5500 (cost of buying back and repair) so while it is a bit of a faff I think it economically makes sense. Any advice welcome!

Given your description £1500 sounds high. Feels like more of a £1000 repair depending on damage some pictures would help?

Just beware, typically once your insurance pays out your policy will be cancelled and the rest of your policy £ will be non refundable and no more courtesy car etc.

If £12,500 was their first offer to you, there is usually always wiggle room for more and worth making a little fuss about. Potentially get an additional up to £1k depending how accurate their current valuation is. Get some quotes for your car on hpi websites as proof."

Personally, I think PCP is sortof a scam. Consider it like a subscription for a car you never own, if you want that sort of thing.

HP is an option, but I prefer a personal loan. The rates you can get from a bank are normally better than offered by a car place, you can borrow as much or as little as you need to and you own the car when it's paid off. The difference between HP and a loan is you need a deposit for HP and you're locked into their interest rates instead of being able to shop around.

As a pro-tip, if your dealer offers you a discount for taking out *their* HP plan and you know you can get it cheaper as a loan, ask if you can pay it off without a penalty, and then borrow the loan amount and pay off the HP agreement leaving the lower loan repayments.

EDIT: PCP is good if you want a cheaper monthly payment, a new car every 3 years and don't want to pay for servicing, but it's the most expensive way to do this IMO
