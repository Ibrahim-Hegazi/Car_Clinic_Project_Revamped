One day, while driving a longer distance, the check engine light begins flashing, car has reduced engine power, jerking and has an unstable idle. Last time this happened(about 2-3yrs ago), me and my dad(hobby mech.) changed the O2-sensor and it was fine again(check engine light came back after a short while, but car worked fine).

 I dont have the space for own repairs or easy acces to tools where i live now, so i took the car to a mechanic for diagnosis, and he told me he didn't really know excactly what was wrong, pointing out the muliple error codes and saying it could be the O2-sensor, but it could also be bad spark plugs or the catalytic converter. So he wasn't really sure what i should do, especially since the O2-sensor was changed not too long ago, but it could also just be that we installed a bad sensor. Im a broke student so really want to avoid spending money on something that doesn't need fixing(if it is the catalytic converter then lord have mercy).  Should i just make him replace the o2-sensor anyway? or does it make more sense to change something else?

I would perform a capacitive discharge at the battery. With the key on, disconnect both battery terminals and short them together to drain a capacitor memory from the modules (just 5 or 10 seconds with the terminals touched together is plenty). Before reconnecting the battery terminals, turn the key off. Now connect the positive battery terminal first, then the negative terminal to finish. Note: All basic settings will have gone away... the factory radio will be in safe mode and want a code, the one touch windows will not work (need to set window basics).

Blows a fuse right as you go to start it

Starter was bad, changed it to no avail.
Disconecting both wires from starter doesnt help

Got the whole fusebox out took it appart no oxidation neither on the motherboards nor plugs, rang through the board with a tester everything is good

Checked the starter trigger wire the whole way from the starter til the fuse box everything is alright

Theres 3 identical relays in the fusebox switched them all around which didnt help, changed all of them to brand new ones which also didnt help

Havent looked into the positive cable (big one) comming off the starter since the fuse blows only when you go to start it and its always live.

Came to the conclusion maby the issue is in the ignition itself took that out havent had a look at it yet but i came upon a gps tracker wired to my car while taking the ignition out.
Wondering if the tracker could be the issue since it also has a imobiliser

(Maby previous owner installed it to steal back the car after selling but couldnt get it since its almost always behind gates and rage quit turning the immobiliser on?)
A wild guess

The image added is from the tracker brands website which raised me some suspicion cuz what i understand is that you have to get rid of a wire and the tracker acts as the wire but would it blow a fuse if they remotely turned immobiliser on?

1o0mzi5,OBD light keeps coming on and off ‚Äî PM sensor fault? What should I do?,"Hey everyone, Need a bit of advice here because this has me scratching my head.

About a month ago, my OBD came on. I got it scanned and it pointed to the PM (particulate matter) sensor. Turns out the coupler/connector was a bit loose. I re-seated it, cleared the code, and the light went off. The car ran perfectly fine after that.

Fast-forward exactly a month later, the light comes back on again. Got it checked once more and the same PM sensor fault popped up. Mechanic said the sensor is working but getting weak, probably on its way out. Haven‚Äôt replaced it yet.

What‚Äôs confusing is that after driving around for a bit (roughly 1,800 km since the first time), the check engine light turned off by itself again. No new codes, car feels normal, mileage is decent, and there are no DPF warnings or limp mode issues.

So now I‚Äôm wondering what to do: 

‚Ä¢	Can I safely drive another few hundred km before replacing the PM sensor? 

‚Ä¢	Could driving with a weak PM sensor harm the DPF if it starts misreading? 

‚Ä¢	Or should I just replace it right away to be safe?

For context, this is a mahindra 3xo diesel. I do a mix of highway and city driving, and it‚Äôs been regenerating fine as far as I can tell.

I have already ordered the pm sensor from mahindra. But they are taking over a month now.

Should I be worried or just schedule a replacement soon and keep driving for now?",1,1759861742.0,2,MechanicAdvice,1759952016,2025-10-07 18:29:02,2025-10-08 19:33:36,"LWschool (Score: 1): It‚Äôs perfectly normal behavior for a failing sensor, for the code to go on and off based on driving conditions.

1o0gbhs,$450 for starter cleaning on 2020 Hyundai Sonata Limited (fair or rip-off?),"
Hey everyone, looking for some advice before I approve this repair.

I have a 2020 Hyundai Sonata Limited that sometimes has trouble starting. It‚Äôs random. sometimes it starts fine, other times it won‚Äôt start at all. I‚Äôve tried jump-starting it and even wiggling the starter, which sometimes gets it to work.

I took it to a Hyundai service center and they said the issue is with the starter. But instead of replacing it, they‚Äôre charging me $450 for:

‚ÄúMisc: R and R starter, clean B+ terminal, and replace nut.‚Äù

The guy told me that they have to clean the starter but I cant find that service anywhere else.

The diagnostic fee was $270, but they said it‚Äôll be waived if I get the work done there.

Another service center near me quoted $506 to replace the starter entirely, which seems like a much better deal than paying $450 just for cleaning.

They also told me I need rear rotors and brake pads. I already have my own brake pads if that makes a difference. They're charging 800 to replace rotors and brake pads on the rear. 

Does $450 sound fair for what they‚Äôre calling ‚Äústarter cleaning‚Äù? Would it make more sense to just replace the starter for $506 instead? And is it worth doing the rotors while they‚Äôre already working on the car?

Any advice or experience with this would be really appreciated.",1,1759847275.0,3,MechanicAdvice,1759952016,2025-10-07 14:27:55,2025-10-08 19:33:36,"lampministrator (Score: 3): For cleaning some corrosion?  That can be cleaned up without removing the starter, no doubt.  Also if it's corroding, they should be looking at the cable and cutting the cancer out, and putting a new end on.  

Secondly, If this were my shop, I'd have done the cleaning already as part of the diagnostic.  They don't KNOW that's the issue until it's cleaned up.  Some strange times we live in where the tech won't go that extra step -- just to be sure they are right.

The brakes --  That is a 2 hour job.  800 (even if that includes rotors) is extremely high.  You should be paying half that.  You're already ass deep right now, you're going to pay the diag fee if you bail.  It might be worth the money you save on the brake job to get it to another shop and have the starter replaced and the cable repaired correctly."

Seats, carpet, probably the headliner. all those items can be cleaned, but there will be damage from the process The question is what is underneath the seat covers or growing in the foam and cardboard of other parts. the hvac system needs to be purged to do a proper job. when you start introducing fluid into the system, vent, etc. you start ruining things but it needs to happen.

This comes down to budget, time and your definition of clean. I‚Äôd probably run an ozone machine inside for over a week, perhaps longer. Not continuous because that will burn the machine out but a few times a day to try to kill whatever is inaccessible. If you‚Äôre not trying to replace the interior, I would probably start with mold and mildew sprays, carpet vac, power washing and sunlight.

Most molds are killed off by temperatures of 60-70¬∞C (140-160¬∞F). I do t see any way to get the temps this high without your car interior melting down, but if you have a choice where to park, make it bright sun.  

Honestly, you may just wanna get a donor car and swap interiors. worst case get a couple replacement seats and rhino line the inside.

There are a few exceptions, particularly if the vehicle is not drivable. The body work itself is not that bad, so you might get a quote from a body shop for a respray. Get a trade in quote of your Tesla with the damage/bad paint and then compare that to an expected trade in for a good condition Tesla.¬† Obviously if your trade in value minus the cost of repair exceeds the cost of the good condition trade in, it's not worth it to pay to have it fixed before trading it in¬†


If you really want to sell it as is, you could also auction it. That's a pretty good way to get a good value out of a vehicle that has a known issue. Since you have several guys bidding who generally know the value of cars, you end up with a pretty reasonable price and don't have to worry about getting low balled.¬†

1o0ut1n,Knock sensor replacement engine code P0330,"Hello, thanks in advance, I appreciate your time and input.

Recently my 1998 Lexus Es300 gave a check engine light code of p0330.  

The autozone printout suggested a new knock sensor as well as an intake manifold gasket and an intake plenum gasket.  

A mobile mechanic who I have used in the past suggested both sensors, the wiring cables and harness as well as the gaskets, but to only buy parts from the dealership.  

Checking online, autozone uses Dorman products, which have pretty bad reviews for their Sensor/wiring kits that while affordable can have problems very soon.  Napa has the same kit but under their ""Napa solutions"" line.  

The Napa line looks to have much better reviews but I am hoping for input on the drawbacks of using parts that are not from the dealership and anyones opinion on the NAPA parts.  

  
Thanks guys",1,1759879743.0,3,autorepair,1759952016,2025-10-07 23:29:03,2025-10-08 19:33:36,"No_Recommendation671 (Score: 1): 
For a critical and labor-intensive job like replacing knock sensors on that engine, using OEM (dealership) parts is strongly recommended. While NAPA's premium lines are generally considered good quality aftermarket options, the high cost of labor to access these sensors means you want the most reliable parts possible to avoid doing the job twice.
## Parts Quality: OEM vs. NAPA vs. Dorman
 * OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer): These are the parts your Lexus was built with (or the direct replacement from Toyota/Lexus). They are engineered specifically for your vehicle and have the highest likelihood of performing correctly long-term. For sensitive electronics like knock sensors, this is the safest bet.
 * NAPA (Premium Lines): NAPA parts are often a significant step up from budget brands. They are a reputable aftermarket supplier, and their parts can be a good value. However, for a sensor buried deep in the engine, even a small increase in failure rate compared to OEM can be a costly gamble.
 * Dorman: As you noted, Dorman has a mixed reputation, especially for electronic components. While they offer affordable solutions, their sensors have a higher reported failure rate, making them a poor choice for a job this difficult to access.
## Why This Specific Repair Matters üîß
The check engine code P0330 indicates a fault in the circuit for the knock sensor on Bank 2. On your Lexus's V6 engine (the 1MZ-FE), the two knock sensors and their wiring harness are located underneath the lower intake manifold, deep in the ""V"" of the engine.
 * High Labor Cost: To replace them, a mechanic has to remove the entire upper and lower intake manifold. This is a multi-hour job, and the labor will be the most expensive part of the bill.
 * Harness is Crucial: Your mechanic was smart to suggest replacing the wiring harness. The original harness becomes extremely brittle from heat and age, and it's often the cause of the P0330 code, not the sensor itself. Never replace the sensors without replacing the harness.
 * Do it Once, Do it Right: Because of the high labor cost, saving a hundred dollars on aftermarket sensors is not worth the risk of one failing in a year and having to pay for the entire job all over again.
## Final Recommendation
 * Buy the knock sensors and the sub-harness from a Lexus or Toyota dealership. The peace of mind is well worth the extra upfront cost.
 * If the OEM parts are absolutely not in the budget, the NAPA parts are a much better second choice than Autozone/Dorman.
 * Ensure your mechanic replaces both knock sensors and the harness at the same time. This is the correct way to perform this repair and prevent future issues. üëç"

1o09fj8,Intermittent Issue my Mechanic Can't Solve,"This is for a 1999 Mercury Sable LS 3.0L with only 50,000 original miles on it.  Since near the beginning of this year I've had an intermittent issue that's super annoying.  First of all, I don't drive much, and basically just go to my local stores a couple of times per week.  Every so often when I go to start my car when I'm leaving whichever local destination, the engine starts, and then putters out initially.  Then if you keep trying to start it, it gets worse and won't even turn over.

The only thing that resolves the issue is letting the engine sit for a few hours until it cools all the way down, and then it will start and stay running normally.  So each time it happens, I have to take an Uber home, let it sit for a few hours, then take another Uber back to where I left it so that I can start it.  This has happened three or four times already this year.

The problem is that my mechanic shop, who is extremely capable, and I've been going to them for many years, never can duplicate the issue to be able to pinpoint what it is exactly.  They've driven it around some, turn it off, then turn it back on, and it starts.  That happens to me 90% of the time too, but every so often the issue resurfaces.

They suspected it could have been a couple of things.  My fuel pressure was originally really low, so they changed the fuel filter, and now there is proper pressure, but that evidently wasn't the issue.  They also replaced the Camshaft Position Sensor.  The issue still persisted after that.

Then I did happen to read on Reddit from a user who had a very similar issue.  He said that he cleaned his mass airflow sensor with the special solvent spray they make for it, and it fixed it.  So I did the same thing near the end of May of this year, and I haven't had the issue again until yesterday.  I literally thought that I resolved it myself, but evidently after about four months, it resurfaced again.  I really don't know what to do at this point.

I don't want to have to replace my car for something like this, but if I can't resolve it, I really have no other choice since I never know when I'm going to get stuck someplace with it.  If can just pinpoint exactly what the issue is, I can finally get it resolved.

The bottom line is that it's obviously related to some type of temperature sensitive issue since it only happens (intermittently) when the engine is heated up to normal working temperature, and only after when it's driven around, not heated up at idle.  Then when it cools down, it's able to be started again normally with no issues.  Any suggestions?

I have a similar issue with one of my vehicles. When it gets hot, the fuel system gets really hot as well. I finally figured out to pour some water on it and the truck will start right up. It seems like something with the fuel getting too hot, vaporizing, and essentially vapor locking the engine.


My advise is to drive it normally, but carry a couple bottles of water. If it does the fault, pour the water on the fuel rail and then see if it will start.

Okay, I was wrong about that previous alternator statement... the positive wire goes directly to the connection post of the alternator, but as noted here, when disconnected, the post does not show a short to ground or the case of the alternator... but the positive wire does show the 95 ohms.

So the 95 ohms from the positive cable to ground is persistent. The cable harness appears to split and go to only 3 locations; the alternator, starter and main (large) fuse and relay panel in the engine compartment. With their power wires disconnected, neither the positive terminal of the starter or alternator show a short or 95 ohms to ground. They are open, so it makes me think those devices are not internally shorted.

But the fuse box (PHOTO), where the + power cable connects to it, with that + power cable disconnected, still shows 95 ohms to the negative terminal under where the cable connects... which I don't understand.. unless there is a hidden power connection somewhere that I can't see that is shorting this out.

Another point, measuring either side of each fuse from either/both the positive cable and/or the negative cable of the battery, I get NO resistance! How is that possible? LOL

The camera is pointed directly at the front differential, and this type of noise is a classic symptom of problems within it.
Primary Suspect: Front Differential
The whining noise you're hearing is very characteristic of failing gears or bearings inside the differential. Here are the common causes:
 * Low Differential Fluid: This is the best-case scenario. If the fluid is low, the gears and bearings aren't properly lubricated, causing them to whine from excessive heat and friction.
 * Worn Pinion Bearing: The pinion bearing supports the pinion gear, which transfers power from the driveshaft to the ring gear. When this bearing wears out, it creates a high-pitched whine that changes with speed and acceleration. This is a very common point of failure. * Worn Ring and Pinion Gears: If the gears themselves are worn or damaged, they will no longer mesh correctly, resulting in a whining or howling sound.
Other Possibilities
While less likely based on the sound's apparent location, here are a few other things that could cause a similar noise:
 * Wheel Bearing: A bad wheel bearing can also produce a whining or humming noise. However, this sound is usually more noticeable from the wheel area and may change when you turn left or right.
 * CV Axle: While the CV axle is visible, it typically makes clicking or popping sounds when turning, not a consistent high-pitched whine during acceleration.
What to Do Next
 * Check the Front Differential Fluid: This should be your immediate first step. A mechanic can quickly check the fluid level and condition. If it's low, black, or has metal shavings in it, you've likely found the source of the problem.
 * Get a Professional Diagnosis: üë®‚Äçüîß It's highly recommended to have a qualified mechanic listen to the noise, preferably with a stethoscope, to pinpoint its exact source. They can confirm if the issue is the differential, a bearing, or something else.
Do not ignore this sound. A failing differential can eventually seize up, which is a serious safety hazard that could cause you to lose control of the vehicle."

Shop puts the new one on and says the crank snout is all scarred up and when he pressed it on it went on pretty easy and says that the crankshaft will have to be replaced they even used a laser tool to measure the pulley placement etc.

Can a bad crankshaft snout make the car still continue to make the car run hot if the pulley can't be mounted on to the crankshaft correctly? Is it not spinning as it should which results in a lot higher engine temps? They think this was the root cause of all of the other issues and it's just finally got so bad that it's got to this point.

Your line of thinking is correct.
Here‚Äôs a breakdown of why this happens and answers to your questions.
How a Damaged Crank Snout Causes Overheating
The issue stems from the relationship between the crankshaft, the harmonic balancer (which is the main crank pulley), the serpentine belt, and the water pump.
 * Crankshaft Snout: This is the front-most tip of the engine's crankshaft where the main pulley, the harmonic balancer, is mounted. It requires a very precise, tight fit.
 * Harmonic Balancer: This pulley drives the serpentine belt.
 * Serpentine Belt: This belt wraps around several pulleys to power essential accessories, most importantly the water pump and the alternator.
 * Water Pump: This component is crucial for your cooling system. It circulates coolant between the engine and the radiator to dissipate heat.
When the crankshaft snout is scarred or damaged, the harmonic balancer cannot be pressed on securely. This creates two major problems:
 * Pulley Wobble: The balancer won't spin true. It will wobble as the crankshaft rotates.
 * Belt Slippage: This wobble causes the serpentine belt to lose proper tension and slip. The squeaking noise you heard was a classic symptom of a slipping belt.
Because the belt is slipping, it's not turning the water pump pulley at the correct speed. A slow-spinning water pump cannot circulate enough coolant to keep the engine cool, especially at higher RPMs like on the highway. This directly leads to the overheating you experienced.
Answering Your Specific Questions
 * Can a bad crankshaft snout make the car still continue to run hot if the pulley can't be mounted correctly?
   Yes, absolutely. The incorrectly mounted pulley is the direct cause. It prevents the water pump from working effectively, leading to overheating. This explains why replacing other cooling system parts like the thermostat didn't solve the problem.
 * Is it not spinning as it should which results in a lot higher engine temps?
   Exactly. The crankshaft itself is spinning correctly, but the power from its rotation isn't being transferred properly to the belt and, subsequently, to the water pump. The slipping belt is the weak link in the chain, causing the water pump to underperform and the engine temperature to rise.
The fact that the new harmonic balancer was ""pretty easy"" to press on and then fell off confirms the mechanic's diagnosis. The crankshaft snout is damaged and can no longer hold the pulley correctly. Unfortunately, replacing the crankshaft is the correct, though expensive, repair."

No_Recommendation671 (Score: 1): 
Your friend's suggestion that the low RPMs are a factor is correct, but it's more of a contributing condition than the root cause. Driving at a very low RPM in a high gear puts the engine under a high load, which can exaggerate underlying issues. The ""hiccuping"" feeling you're experiencing is likely one of a few common problems.
Most Likely Cause: Torque Converter Shudder
This is a very common issue in automatic transmission cars, including the C6 Corvette with the 6L80 transmission.
 * What it is: Inside your transmission, the torque converter has a clutch that locks up in higher gears (like 6th) at cruising speeds. This creates a direct mechanical link from the engine to the wheels, improving fuel efficiency. When this clutch or the transmission fluid gets old or worn, it can slip and grab instead of engaging smoothly, causing a shudder or vibration that feels exactly like a ""hiccup"" or driving over a rumble strip.
 * Why it fits: This problem almost always happens under light acceleration in overdrive gears at low RPMs, precisely the conditions you described (60 mph in 6th gear at ~1,100 RPM).
 * The Fix: Often, this can be resolved with a transmission fluid change (a ""flush and fill"") using the correct, high-quality fluid (ACDelco DEXRON-VI for your car). Sometimes a specific friction modifier additive is also required.
Other Potential Causes
While less likely than torque converter shudder, these are other possibilities:
 * Engine Misfire: A weak spark plug, ignition coil, or spark plug wire can cause a misfire under high load/low RPM conditions. The engine struggles to combust the fuel-air mixture properly, creating a stumble or hiccup. Usually, a persistent misfire will trigger a Check Engine Light, but a very minor, intermittent one might not.
 * Active Fuel Management (AFM): Your 2008 automatic Corvette has AFM, which deactivates four of the eight cylinders under light load to save fuel. Sometimes, the engagement or disengagement of this system can be felt as a slight shudder. A malfunction in one of the AFM lifters could also cause a more noticeable issue.
 * Dirty Sensors or Throttle Body: A dirty Mass Airflow (MAF) sensor or throttle body can send incorrect information to the car's computer, causing slight hesitations under steady cruising. Cleaning these is often a simple and inexpensive first step in diagnosis.
What To Do Next ü§î
 * Confirm the Symptom: See if you can reliably reproduce it. Note the exact speed and RPM. Try applying slightly more or less throttle to see if it changes or goes away.
 * Test in 5th Gear: Use the paddle shifters to manually put the car in 5th gear at the same speed (60 mph). This will raise the RPMs. If the hiccuping disappears, it strongly points towards a torque converter shudder or a load-related misfire that only occurs at very low RPMs.
 * Scan for Codes: Even without a Check Engine Light, there might be ""pending"" trouble codes stored in the computer. An auto parts store can often scan these for free.
 * Start Simple: Consider cleaning the MAF sensor and throttle body first. If that doesn't work, a transmission fluid service would be the next logical step, as it's both a likely fix and good preventative maintenance."

What's Happening?
The buildup you see is a classic sign of a slow fluid leak. Oil or transmission fluid drips down from a failing seal or gasket, and as you drive, it collects road dust and dirt, creating this thick, greasy sludge. Gravity causes it to accumulate on lower parts of the engine and transmission, like your starter.
Possible Sources of the Leak
Given the location on your 2019 Honda Civic, the leak is most likely coming from one of these places:
 * Valve Cover Gasket: A very common leak source. The gasket at the top of the engine can become brittle and leak oil down the back of the engine block.
 * Rear Main Seal: This seal is located between the engine and the transmission. A leak here is more labor-intensive to fix because the transmission usually has to be removed.
 * Oil Pan Gasket: The seal for the oil pan at the bottom of the engine could be leaking.
 * Transmission Seal: It could also be transmission fluid leaking from a seal on the transmission case.
What You Should Do
Don't panic! While it looks messy, this is often the result of a slow leak that has built up over a long time.
 * Clean the Area: The first step is to have a mechanic thoroughly clean the engine and transmission to remove all the old grime.
 * Diagnose the Source: After cleaning, drive the car for a day or two. The source of the leak will become obvious as fresh fluid will trace a path from the failing seal. Some mechanics may add a UV dye to the oil to make the new leak show up clearly under a blacklight.
 * Get it Repaired: Once the source is identified, you can have the specific gasket or seal replaced.
It's a good idea to get this checked out to prevent the leak from getting worse or the dripping oil from damaging other rubber or plastic components over time."

The symptoms described‚Äîengine revs going up without a corresponding increase in speed, especially after shifting‚Äîare classic signs of a slipping clutch. Your mechanic's initial diagnosis is very likely correct. At 94,000 miles, it's a very common time for the original clutch to wear out.
## What's Happening with a Slipping Clutch?
Think of a clutch as the connection between the engine and the wheels. When it's working properly, it firmly locks the engine's power to the transmission, making the car move. When the friction material on the clutch disc wears down over time (much like a brake pad), it can no longer create a solid grip.
So, when you press the gas, the engine spins faster (you hear the RPMs go up üîä), but that power isn't fully transferred to the wheels because the clutch is slipping. This results in poor acceleration and the feeling of having no power.
## Clutch Replacement Cost
A clutch replacement is a significant repair, not because the parts are extremely expensive, but because it is very labor-intensive. To access the clutch, a mechanic must remove the entire transmission from the car.
 * Estimated Cost: For a 2013 Hyundai Elantra GT in the New York area, you should expect the total cost for a clutch replacement to be in the range of $1,500 to $2,200. Prices can vary significantly based on the specific shop's labor rates and whether they use OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) or quality aftermarket parts.
 * Cost Breakdown: Typically, about 60-70% of the bill is for labor, with the remaining 30-40% for the parts (clutch disc, pressure plate, and release bearing).
 * Pro Tip: While the transmission is out, it's wise to also replace the rear main seal of the engine. This part is inexpensive, but replacing it later would require removing the transmission all over again. It's a smart preventative measure.
## Is It Worth Fixing?
This is a personal financial decision, but here are the key factors to consider:
 * Car's Overall Condition: You mentioned your mechanic says the car is in good shape otherwise. This is a huge point in favor of fixing it. You know the car's history, which is a major advantage over buying another used car with unknown problems.
 * Cost of Repair vs. Value of Car: A 2013 Elantra GT in good condition is still worth several thousand dollars (likely in the $5,000-$7,000 range). A ~$1,800 repair, while expensive, is far cheaper than replacing the car.
 * Future Reliability: A clutch is a ""wear and tear"" item, just like tires or brakes. Replacing it isn't a sign the car is failing; it's a necessary part of its long-term maintenance. A new clutch will restore the car's performance and should last another 80,000-100,000+ miles.
Conclusion: Yes, if the rest of the car is well-maintained, investing in a new clutch is almost certainly a worthwhile repair. It will restore the car's drivability and give you many more years of service. Before agreeing to the work, simply ask for a detailed, written estimate that breaks down the cost of parts and labor."

I have an AE101 Toyota corolla from 1998 with a 4A-FE engine and it won't start. It cranks, but wont even try to fire. I've got a strong spark on each of the plugs and there is fuel in the rail.

The fact that you have a strong spark but the engine won't even try to fire with starting fluid is the key giveaway.
This classic combination of symptoms almost always points to the spark happening at the wrong time in the engine's cycle.
Why It's Likely the Timing ‚öôÔ∏è
An engine needs three things to run: fuel, spark, and compression, delivered at the correct time.
 * You've confirmed spark.
 * You've manually added fuel (starter fluid), bypassing the car's fuel system.
Since adding a guaranteed fuel source did nothing, the problem isn't a lack of fuel. This leaves a major issue with compression or timing. A slipped or broken timing belt causes both of these problems at once.
The good news is that the 4A-FE is a non-interference engine. This means that even if the timing belt snapped, the pistons and valves would not have collided, so you likely haven't suffered catastrophic internal engine damage.
What to Check Next
Here are the steps to diagnose this, starting with the most probable cause.
1. Visually Inspect the Timing Belt
This should be your number one priority. You don't need to take the whole engine apart.
 * Remove the upper timing belt cover. It's usually held on by a few 10mm bolts.
 * Once it's off, look at the belt. Is it still there? Is it shredded or missing teeth? Is it very loose? If it's broken or damaged, you've found your problem.
2. Verify the Timing Marks
If the belt is physically intact, you need to check if it has ""skipped a tooth.""
 * Using a socket and ratchet on the main crankshaft bolt, manually turn the engine clockwise until the timing mark on the crankshaft pulley lines up with the ""0"" mark on the lower timing cover. * Now, look at the camshaft pulley. Its timing mark should line up perfectly with the mark on the engine's backplate or valve cover. * If the crankshaft mark is at zero but the camshaft mark is off by one or more teeth, the timing has skipped. You will need to replace the timing belt and reset the timing.
3. If Timing is Correct, Check Compression
You mentioned being nervous about this, but it's a crucial step if the timing turns out to be correct. You don't necessarily need to put the car on stands. As long as you can access the spark plug holes, you can do the test.
 * Rent a compression tester from an auto parts store.
 * Remove all four spark plugs.
 * Disable the fuel and ignition systems (usually by pulling the 'EFI' fuse or relay).
 * Screw the tester into one spark plug hole, have a friend crank the engine for 5-6 seconds, and record the reading.
 * Repeat for all cylinders.
   Low or zero compression across all cylinders would also point back to a major timing issue.
Addressing Your Other Concerns
 * Crank/Cam Sensors: On the 4A-FE engine, the necessary sensors (pickup coils) are typically located inside the distributor. If they had failed, you would have no spark, but you've confirmed you have a strong spark. So, these are very unlikely to be the problem.
 * Distributor Cap/Coil: You are correct. A bad cap, rotor, or ignition coil would result in a weak spark or no spark at all. Since your spark is strong, these components are likely fine.
 * ECU: An ECU failure is possible but extremely rare and should be considered a last resort after all mechanical possibilities have been exhausted."

1o0ts73,How to question the mechanic without offending?,"Ive had a hell of a time with my Hyundai Veracruz. 

I bought the damn thing and two weeks later the head gasket blew. The dealer only offered a discount through his shop for an engine replacement. I agreed because it was a good deal price wise as I had asked for quotes from other shops but didn't want to go back to that place for any future work as I didn't  trust them. They did charge me for an oil change in addition to the new engine install.

Well a couple weeks later  it was making a weird rattle noise upon startup with a cold engine, and there were some engine lights codes. Not too long after that the AC started to fade.

My Dad tinkered with the AC before he told me to take it in and said he was sure the compressor was bad and there was probably a leak. I decided to take it in to a mechanic a friend recommended so we could find out about the rattle noise. 

That shop said we needed a new O2 sensor, they also caught the Y exhaust pipe needed to be replaced, and the car was missing 3 quarts of oil.  The noise I heard was the timing chains from lack of oil. I asked how as the oil change wasn't long ago and he told me he wasn't sure why the oil was missing and said he'd ask the mechanic. He kinda rushed me off the phone before I could ask about the AC so I asked if he could email me the quote.

The quote he gave me for repair doesn't include a new compressor - just to add freon and a charge for the dye. It quotes for the new y pipe too and that's it.  It doesn't mention adding more oil or fixing whatever was going on with the oil leaking.  

I'm not trying to say we don't trust their judgement, we just need a better explanation of everything. I don't want them to get annoyed or think I'm questioning their expertise. But my dad knows what a broken compressor looks like so we're just wondering what happened there? Maybe they fixed it?
Also I'm worried about the oil. Are they planning on not adding oil or did they decide to give me 3 quarts for free?  Why is it missing oil?

As for the oil; I would hope they're giving it to you for free but they may not want to touch the last guy's incorrect head gasket job. While you're asking about the a/c testing they've done, mention that you noticed they're not charging you for it and you want to confirm they're correcting the level. Once again, specific polite questions. If they say no, ask them to document the low oil for you and raise hell at the dealer. If it's a chain shop (pep boys, brakes plus, etc) they may also tell you to do this when you ask.

How much ac work does your dad do? Because I suspect he saw it not engaging and called it broken.

On the other hand if he saw damage on the outside of the compressor unlikely without a loud bang and metal falling out) or the wiring and the shop claims it's fine, I would get a second opinion before doing any AC repairs.

If you're extra skeptical of their work I would usually suggest asking for the old parts back but it sounds like everything they quoted could be done without removing anything if they're doing a weld repair to the exhaust. If they're suggesting you remove and replace the y pipe, then there should be old parts to request. If they refuse without good reasons, I would take my vehicle back and never return. Anyone carrying out the work on the receipt is taking the old parts off and probably paying to dispose them.

The fuel pump will constantly run gas up to the engine and back to the tank, so it doesn't take as long as you might think. And it'll be a little smokey for the first tank of gas that'll have some diesel mixed in. After that, should be good to go. 

Side note: the reverse of this is not true. Gasoline in a diesel truck is a very bad thing. Good chance it'll be a complete fuel system replacement of around $10-15k on modern diesel trucks. If you accidentally put gasoline in a diesel - don't even turn the key. Don't start it, don't turn it on. Open the hood, disconnect the negative battery cable (to make sure some idiot along the way doesn't start it). And then call a tow truck and take to a mechanic."

My wife drives a 2002 Chevrolet Camaro V6. We bought it lasts October and it's giving me an absolute run for my money with the intake manifold gasket and failing twice. The cars already leaked a ton of coolant to the engine and it's clogged up and burnt out the catalytic converter at this point. 

Looking at a new replacement. 

But I don't want to replace it until I know for sure the car is no longer leaking coolant to the engine and pumping that garbage into the exhaust. 

Are there any great ways of diagnosing internal coolant things? 

I can no longer open up her gasket because I snapped a bolt off in her intake manifold and I don't want to extract it unless I absolutely have to. I put UV tie in her coolant to address any external leaks. And I did find one because of a missing o-ring.

I have a 2014 Mini Cooper base model. 111,140 miles, 1.5L engine, automatic. 

Posting this from another account because my main one got hacked :/

I took it in because I had a hard brake, and when I pushed down it felt like a rock skipping (I hope this description makes sense) I already knew my alignment needed to be done, so I scheduled an appointment.

When I took it in, they said my brakes are fine, and I got my alignment done. They also flushed my brake lines. I drove my car home, and noticed my brakes are soft, that I had to press down harder to brake. I called them again and told them my brakes are soft, and they scheduled me the next day.

They told me they bled the brakes, and also told me that my master cylinder needs to be replaced and this caused my brakes to be soft. I didn‚Äôt ask them because I was just so overwhelmed with all the information (I know nothing about cars!) but how was this missed the first time? If they are under there checking my brakes and rotors, how could they miss my master cylinder being broken?

They told me they didn‚Äôt have the part, that I would have to go to a specialty place. I bought from a second hand mini dealership, so I said I would just go back there. I asked them if I can still drive my car, if it‚Äôs still safe to drive. They said yes. I drove off with little to zero brakes. I was at the point of needing to use my hand brake/ pumping my brakes just to get myself home. 

Fast forward to now, I spent $200 on a tow to get it 16 miles away to the dealership. They just messaged me saying yes my master cylinder needs to be replaced. When I bought the car, I purchased a warranty. Luckily this work is covered. However, they also informed me that my front brake pads and sensors need to be replaced, as well as my spark plug. For that work I‚Äôm getting quoted $958.09. Again, how did the mechanic shop that I originally went to miss this?

Is the first shop really bad? Or am I getting sold up on stuff by the secondhand dealership? I‚Äôve had issues with the dealership in the past, I needed my alignment done and he took it in twice to a place because they didn‚Äôt do it right the first time and when I got my car back after I still needed it done, which is what I did earlier this week. 

I‚Äôm already $700 in with the alignment, brake flush, and tow, so understandably I‚Äôm a little uncertain about dropping another $1000. There‚Äôs a certified mini dealership in the area, I‚Äôve been thinking I can take it there for a quote for my brake pads, sensors, and spark plug but I‚Äôd still have to wait for my master cylinder to get repaired. At this point I‚Äôm out a car for 5 days and I need to work!

I was talking to the dealership today, and I have to wait for the warranty work to be approved, and they don‚Äôt have loaner cars. I could be out a car for a whole month.

TL;DR
Conflicting diagnostics from different mechanics, is the first one just bad at their job or is the dealership lying to me?

I got this 2013 Ford Edge SEL (163,989 miles) from my girlfriend 6 months ago. While she owned it, for months, she was driving with the brake light, abs light, service advance and advance trac lights on her dash. 

We took it to a mechanic once it was time for me to buy the vehicle, and we got the codes P193C-00 and U3000-49. Apparently they cleared the steering wheel angle, and then they suggested we replace and reprogram the ABS module ($1100ish). Problem is I am not in a financial position to have that done.

When I got the car after getting it repaired at the mechanic, all of those lights have come on and off several times, usually for weeks at a time before randomly cutting off for another few weeks. That being said, I have had no issues driving it! There isn't any steering wheel locking up, no hydroplaning, so brakes locking up, it all feels fine.

So, what the fuck is happening here? I feel frustrated because from my research, there isn't a clear answer. There's people who have spent the money to replace the module but it didn't fix their issue, and as I said, I don't have the financial means to mess up on finding this problem.

1o0msaz,Front cylinder misfires on twin cylinder Suzuki motorcycle engine.,"TLDR: Front cyl missing, Suzuki C50 VL800 2017 3700 miles

I‚Äôve seen a few threads on forums about Suzuki Boulevard issues with its front cylinder. Mostly older bikes.

I thought I‚Äôd share this.

2 months ago the fuel pump failed on this bike and was replaced. It runs fine afterward until 2 weeks ago, it starts to misfiring.

* Rechecked the fuel delivery = OK
* Checked spark plugs, wires, ignition coils, fire = OK and same on both cylinders
* Checked injectors spraying pattern = OK and same on both cylinders
* Checked compression = only 90 psi on front cylinder
* Checked valves clearances = OK

Engine evidently ran rough ( mostly on one cyl.), but starts A1.  
I took a laser thermometer to compare the engine output temp. at both exhaust ports and the front cylinder stays much cooler, confirming an issue with cyl. #1.

So, I came to the conclusion that I have an intake valve issue, since when it is cold, there are sometimes light backfires going into the intake of the front cylinder. When hot it tends to go away, but since the compression is low, most unburnt gas ends-up burning inside the hot exhaust pipe, making intermittent pop noises.

I also knows, often rich fuel mixture due to faulty fuel injectors, a malfunctioning fuel pressure regulator, a dirty air filter, or issues with engine sensors like an oxygen or airflow sensor may cause engine misfires.

I could exclude all of the above like dirty air/fuel filters, since the fuel pump is new, the airflow sensors were swapped, having a low compression in one cylinder is most likely the real cause.

What was puzzling is how do you come up with a burn/worn intake valve on a very low mileage engine that has a perfect valves adjustment?

I took a propane torch and injected a slight amount of propane into the front cylinder through the throttle body intake port of cyl. #1, while monitoring its temperature. Turns out that the rough idling went away immediately, the engine smoothed out, and cylinders‚Äô temperatures even out too. It ran like new with a slight amount of LPG supply. I did this for few days until my propane bottle runs out of gas, leaving it cooling down between each test. When the engine reached normal running temperature or the cooling fan started, I shut the engine off.

I think getting the low compression cylinder to ignite, forced the cylinder into normal temperature

and the valves to seat properly again. I don‚Äôt know if something contaminated the fuel or got stuck on the valves seat, but...runs like new ever since.",1,1759861315.0,3,AskMechanics,1759952016,2025-10-07 18:21:55,2025-10-08 19:33:36,Queasy_Author_3810 (Score: 1): I'd just start with spark plugs and coils

1o0gdf7,How to deal with rust?,"After recently buying a car I've been googling about what to do about rust after getting some very split advice irl and it seems to be the same online. 

I've read that it's not worth fixing professionally because of cost and diy won't work well. To leave it and use the car untill it rusts completly or just sell and buy one without rust. That even professionals don't fix rust because it never works. 

But also rust should be fixed asap to minimize spread. To keep and eye on everything and fix with touch up pens or similar asap. That even dyi can last but don't leave it like it is whatever you do. 

Or dyi never works but having it fixed by a professional actually does. Only by removing the old piece of metal and welding a new one can the car be restored. 

It feels like I'm missing something with so conflicting advice. Where's the nuance? Surely a car isn't suddenly doomed the second rust appears. Surely people with new cars don't get a whole new hood every time a rock chips a bit of paint off. Surely people with older cars aren't completly wasting money by doing dyi repairs. 

Also what would you do about the car in the pictures? It's a 2011 Astra and running fine. The rust in the 4th picture has gotten a fair bit worse since I took the pictures a few months ago but rest is the same. 

Thanks!

I own a 2015 Volkswagen Golf, petrol, automatic DSG.

I'd also be fine with an in-between solution, that I do most things myself but still bring it for a check yearly.

  
What would be recommended; do mechanics in yearly checking do more than the basic list in the manual? Like lubricating certain points or checking things?

Also, if I do an oil change, can I reset the service date in the car's system somehow? I have a basic OBD2 scanner, but also a (basic) VAG specific OBD scanner. Not sure if it's possible with that, or a more professional system needed.

My beater Yaris overheated because of a water pump leak. I got the pump changed but its not returning coolant from overflow tank  to the radiator (after cooling down overnight). so it runs low on coolant at some point and loses the heating, and would eventually overheat. 

First thing I did was change the radiator cap, still the same issue. 

Hoses are firm but not unusually stiff. 

Temps on OBD2 are up to around 90c until at some point it loses enough coolant they keep going to low 100s. By then I fill it back manually from overflow.

No coolant is disappearing until it overfils the overflow tank. Oil and coolant look fine. No smoke from the exhaust at any point.

1o079te,2006 Lexus IS250 2.5L 4GR-FSE stalling while driving and going into limp mode. Automatic with 150K KM/93K Miles.,"Hey everyone,

I want to preface this by saying I‚Äôm comfortable with mid-level repairs myself, so if it‚Äôs something reasonable to DIY, I‚Äôm happy to give it a shot.

I've got my 06 is250 with 150k KM (93,000 Miles) with stalling and limp mode issues while driving.

Yesterday it began having issues starting, where the engine will start for a second or two and then turn off again.

I've plugged in an OBD scanner and checked my codes, throughout the time I've had this problem I've had 4 codes:

* P1235 (I only get this code when my car goes into limp mode, It doesn't go into limp mode every time it stalls)
* P1603 (Comes up everytime I stall)
* P1604 (This code started appearing after the car would struggle to start sometimes)
* P1605 (Comes up everytime I stall)

I have tried several things:

* Cleaning my throttle body, it was quite dirty and I thought maybe it was this (It was not).
* I've cleaned my fuel system with Penrite total system cleaner (Didn't really do anything).
* I've tried with a different battery because I thought my battery was causing the starting issues (it did not).
* I've tried doing the ""ECU relearn"" (This has done nothing).
* I changed my PCV valve (Nothing has changed)

I did change my water pump 2 weeks ago, and the car drove fine until about a few days ago. Can it be related to this? I did have to unplug the injector/driver module to get at it.

The car drives fine, I have not noticed a loss of power. It can stall at any speed, whether its a full stop at traffic lights or travelling 50k/hr, 100k/hr (30Miles/hr and 60miles/hr).

The car has no issues starting up when it stalls, only when starting from being turned off for a while can it struggle a little bit.

Ask me more questions for info you need, I‚Äôm honestly lost at this point, so any advice or things to check would be really appreciated.

Is it okay for the car to be on grass for that long?

Put the car on insulation boards or pavers under the tires?

Should the car be started every once in a while and driven?

Should the car have the battery disconnected, the fuel topped off with stabilizer in it and not worry about starting and driving it around?

I have a 2017 Buick Encore with the 1.4L turbo engine. A few months ago I had a P0299 DTC which deals with the turbo and it losing power/possible leaks. There were no obvious leaks so I replaced the waste-gate actuator and turbo feed line, cleared the code, and have been good up until recently.

Last week after driving the car, it smelled like something was burning and brought it in to a local mechanic. The mechanic said it was the turbo burning oil/coolant and it was on it's way out. I recently found a TSB that includes the 2017 Encore and turbo and that if it has a **P0299 code that is active**, the GM dealer can diagnose and replace the turbo for free (if it qualifies). The independent mechanic quoted me $2600 to replace the turbo otherwise.

Is it worth driving the car like it is in hopes I can re-trigger the P0299 so I can possibly get it fixed for free via a bulletin, or should I bring it in and just get it fixed? Any input would really help as I could really use that money elsewhere. Thank you!

I purchased a 2021 Mazda CX-5 about six weeks ago, and currently dealing with recurring brake issues and could use some mechanics' insight.

  
Before buying, I took the vehicle for a PPI at a Midas near the dealership. Mechanic recommended to request dealership to replace the rotor and caliper because of significant rust on the inner side of the rotor and suspicious inconsistent paint on one caliper.

The dealership initially stated on bill of sale that they would ""fix"" the driver's side brake which I made them correct to ""replace"". Few days after purchase, they confirmed that the car was ready.

When I picked up the car, I immediately noticed vibration in the steering wheel when braking at high speed (around at 100km/h). Dealership acknowledged the issue, stating the new rotor was defective, and claimed they would get a new one and use a special machine to ensure that car would run perfectly. This took about another week.

After receiving the car, I left it sitting for about a month while I was working out of town. I recently drove it back to town and noticed scratches and rust on the inner side of rotor again.

  
So, my concern is that the issue recurred so quickly, even with whatever the ""special machine"" they had to use, makes me suspicious whether the dealership just resurfaced the old rotor instead of installing new ones during the first or second attempt. 

And caliper was never replaced (still same painted one), is it likely the problem with caliper?

I'm not sure if dealership would still handle this issue if I bring it back to them even after 6 weeks, but is this level of rust/scratch normal after a month of sitting in Canadian climate?

  
I'd appreciate for any advice.",2,1759796806.0,9,AskMechanics,1759952016,2025-10-07 00:26:46,2025-10-08 19:33:36,"Queasy_Author_3810 (Score: 6): You let it sit for a month? Fuck yeah it's gonna rust in canadian climate. You let that shit sit for 2 weeks in canadian climate and it'll rust lol.

All this to say, ladies and gentlemen, is that if you're ever in doubt, aka don't have absolute 100% faith in the place you take your vehicle to, you ask for your old parts back. 

My personal take is that they just resurfaced them for whatever reason, which makes no sense given it cost that much in labour to do so, it's cheaper to replace.

1o0053z,"MB Dealership overfilled my oil, now its leaking oil","2006 MB C55 AMG 5.4 V8 Auto.  
  
Title. I brought my M113-based Mercedes in for an oil change, they didn't pull both drain plugs, leaving oil in it when they filled it back up. Then drove it on a 450 mile out-of-state business trip. Error lights coming on telling me that it was overfilled, took it back in as soon as I got home, and they syphoned the remained out. Oil level (Digital dipstick) said everything is good. 3500 miles later, I am 1.6 liters low on oil, and there is a visible oil near the back right of the block when you take off the skirts under the motor.

Before you say ""can't prove that the leak started after the oil change"", the ""Mercedes 30-whatever point inspection"" came back all green; this means¬†**the dealership asserted**¬†there was no oil dripping from the bottom of the car when they inspected it. If a dealership saw fresh oil dripping they would have been frothing at the mouth to rope me into a rear-main seal or oil pan job (12 and 5 hours of labor respectively),¬†**so clearly it wasn't leaking prior to this oil change**.

My question is this: What should I be asking for here? I am confident that the leak was caused by the excess oil pressure from the overfill of oil. My list of asks is as follows:

1. Locate the oil leak and repair it.
2. Compression testing on all cylinders
3. Spark plug inspection
4. Visual inspection of cylinder walls/piston rings (borescope)
5. Oil change
6. Service B¬†(due in 5000 miles)
7. Cleaning of the oil on the bottom of the car

Is this realistic? Should I be asking for more? If the walls are scored beyond repair, can I demand they source a new block? Any terms or laws (Massachusetts) I can throw at them to help my case here?

Overfilled oil does not cause excessive oil pressure. I'm not certain of the design of your engine, but the only thing I can think of off the top of my head is maybe some sort of crankcase breather could have been blocked/plugged and may have resulted in said leak.

No real reason to pull/inspect plugs, compression test, and visually inspect the cylinder bores unless you are having some sort of ""related"" drivability issue. Over filled oil isn't going to cause cylinder wall damage. REALLY overfilled oil could cause a consumption issue pulling past the oil rings, but it's unlikely you have that going on.

What is Service B? Why do you think they should just do this for free?

If they are liable for the leak, then yes, they should repair the leak and clean the underside of the vehicle. That's really about all they are liable for."

I need to know what the next steps are when dealing with an independent high-end used car dealership which is now not replying to my email or answering phone calls.

-The day after purchase, I discovered a fault with the exhaust actuator. Following my report of this issue, it was confirmed that the exhaust system had been modified and that the actuator was not attached. Something, I was not made aware of when purchasing the vehicle. I would have never purchased the vehicle if this beeping noise had been identified. 

I had to take the car a few days later to a local garage to diagnose the double beeping noise (out of my own time and money). I paid for an independent diagnostic inspection, which confirmed the issue but also stated that once the car was returned to its original specification, the exhaust actuator should operate normally.

At that time and after a lengthy phone call on the 19/08/2025, you declined to accept a refund (even though it was within the first thirty-days of purchase) and instead advised that the vehicle would be returned to its original factory specification. You then stated that you had contacted the previous owner to recover the original exhaust components in order to restore the car to its stock condition. On that basis, and in good faith, I agreed to allow you the opportunity to carry out this work.

However, despite these assurances and the subsequent work carried out, the fault remains unresolved. The vehicle therefore continues to exhibit the same issue as when it was first reported. I dropped the car to you on 15/09/2025 and didn‚Äôt receive my car back until 30/09/2025. An inconvenience but I was prepared to wait. This was more than enough time to deal with this issue.

Right here you should have returned the car to the garage, handed them the keys and waited in their office until a full refund was issued to your bank. You didn't do that however, no fault of your own, so let's move on.

>I had to take the car a few days later to a local garage to diagnose the double beeping noise (out of my own time and money). I paid for an independent diagnostic inspection, which confirmed the issue but also stated that once the car was returned to its original specification, the exhaust actuator should operate normally.

You absolutely should NOT have done this. It is the dealers onus to sort ANY problems within 6 months of purchasing the car (if it's within 30 days you can get a full refund instantly hence the comment above). They get ONE chance to sort that specific issue, and if it comes back you are entitled to a refund (minus proportional value lost via miles added etc).

>At that time and after a lengthy phone call on the 19/08/2025, you declined to accept a refund (even though it was within the first thirty-days of purchase) and instead advised that the vehicle would be returned to its original factory specification.

On that basis, and in good faith, I agreed to allow you the opportunity to carry out this work.

If the declining of the refund was within the 30 days of purchase, what they did was ILLEGAL. This is under the Consumer Rights Act 2015.

More info here: [https://www.autotrader.co.uk/content/advice/how-does-the-consumer-rights-act-protect-you-when-you-buy-a-car](https://www.autotrader.co.uk/content/advice/how-does-the-consumer-rights-act-protect-you-when-you-buy-a-car)

Ultimately I assume the 30 days has now passed, however the declination of a refund within that time is something to very much highlight. They CANNOT decline a refund within that time especially considering the circumstances you report.

Now that it's within 6 months and outside 30 days, they have 1 chance to fix the issue, which they have now used. The issue still persists so you are entitled to a refund (just not full, they are allowed to take a relative amount off for the value lost via miles or any damage caused to the car udner your ownership).

What you need to do is contact Citizens Advice here: [https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/) and give them an outline of the situation. They will be far better than any of us redditors at giving you assistance. They will likely ask you to send a written letter (yes a letter on paper) with tracked delivery and a deadline for them to contact you. This is the first steps of legal action. 

You also should leave a honest review on every single platform you can find for the dealer, as it should be made very well known how dodgy this dealership is. It's important you make this review as factual as possible, do not include any personal feelings (they will try and take the review down hence the word of advice).

If it were me personally, I would also be contacting a lawyer for advice and a potential court case depending on the value of the car. What they have done is absolutely illegal.

Avionykx (Score: 3): In a previous life I used to deliver fuel.  
People are correct in that fuel in the UK comes from 1 of 4 refineries, and all the base fuel is the same. 

The difference is in the additives. So no, a particular brand doesn't have ""trash"" fuel over another. Are some of the additives beneficial for your engine? Yes. They all put a lot of money into developing them. 

I'd imagine that unless an engine is specifically tuned for a very specific fuel octane/additive mix there'll be no real benefit to anyone really driving on the road.

Most people would probably get exactly the same results by using Tesco base fuel and then once every 6 months putting in a capful of additive off the shelf like RedX or whatever is available these days. 

  
The only really valid question is do some cars run better on different octane fuel? Absolutely. It's not something I've subscribed to in the past. My Land Rover / Range Rover and before that endless range of hot hatches didn't give a damn about the fuel but my current petrol V8 has a noticable difference when on higher octane fuel.  
  
The worries of old came from stories about particular forecourts having tanks that were contaminated. This might have been valid years ago but now testing is so strict that there's very little chance of that happening.

If you want to hate on a particular forecourt for having trashy tanks then that could be, in some stretch of the world, be possible. However you can't then go and translate that to the same brand 20 miles away.

Basically, it's trying to guess the range based on your current driving, but it can't predict the future, it can only make in-the-moment estimates based on a very limited dataset. It'll start off thinking it has enough fuel for 210 miles (if you have three gallons left and the car can do 70 mpg). But then you only drive 10 miles and stop. Then another 10 miles and stop. So it's going to revise its range estimate downwards. If you drive 210 miles in 21 journeys, your fuel consumption will be much worse than if you do it in one journey.

Also, for the purposes of protecting the manufacturer from liability if you run out of fuel and get stranded, the computer will always be very, very, very conservative in its estimates.

> Also what's the best way to be fuel efficient in a diesel anyways? Any different from a petrol?

1o0fr2o,Why is it so hard to buy a used car in the UK right now? Our saga is genuinely insane.,"Right, I just need to vent this because I‚Äôm starting to think the universe actively doesn‚Äôt want us to buy a new car. Has anyone else experienced anything this ridiculous?

**Car 1:**

Found a car we liked, pulled the trigger, paid the holding deposit. Booked an AA check for the hand-over day. Then, I get a call saying the garage needed to postpone the check because of an *outstanding finance agreement* on the car... for a previous buyer! Despite my deposit, this mess cost me a **¬£100 AA cancellation fee**. We walked away immediately.

**Car 2:**

Found the next one (thankfully the AA gave us a discount for the next check). This one looked perfect on paper. We went to get it checked and it came back with multiple issues that would have been an instant **MOT fail**. It had only just been MOT'd *the day before* for us by the seller. Sketchy as anything, so that was also a no-go..

**Car 3:**

We actually managed to get the next car delivered! However, on the way down, the engine management light came on. It spent two weeks in a local garage with a suspected injector fault, which the dealer covered the **¬£600 cost** to fix. Great, we thought.

Nope.

It then transpired there were **metal filings in the fuel tank**, immediately ruining the brand new injector. Upon starting it up, it was confirmed to be a faulty fuel pump. The dealer was good enough to take it back and has since replaced the fuel lines, pump, tank, and all four injectors. At this point, we just decided to cut our losses and get a refund.

**Car 4:**

We thought we were done looking, but then a few weeks later we found ""the one"" - top spec, low mileage, exactly what we wanted, even if it was ¬£4k more than all the others.

During their pre-sale checks, they found a pending fault code. They suspected it was a lambda sensor, changed it, but the fault code persists. They've now told us they'll refund our holding deposit and we should let them carry on trying to fix it.

Honestly, what is going on? Is the used car market just completely cursed right now, or have we got the worst luck in the country?

1o0agpc,Exposing the GVE London & George Scam,"I think it‚Äôs about time I shared my story about the GVE London scam. Many of you have probably seen the Reddit post about an Aston Martin V12 Vantage being impounded by the police, well that Aston Martin was mine.

I‚Äôm sharing this story in the hope that the person who unknowingly bought my car might eventually get his money back. I have evidence to support everything I‚Äôm saying in this story.

I handed my car to GVE London in late July to sell it on a Sale or Return (SOR) basis. From the moment I left the car there, it was nothing but lies. After later speaking with both the police and the buyer, I learned that the car had actually been sold above asking price as it included some repair work and delivery. This sale happened in late July.

At that time, I knew nothing about this sale. Around ten days after the sale (when the car was already at the new owner‚Äôs home, taxed and insured), I got a call from George at GVE London. He claimed he had an offer on my car ¬£10,000 below the asking price. Naturally, I declined. He said he‚Äôd get back to me.

Let me remind you my car had already been sold ten days earlier for more than the asking price. The man is a complete liar and made this offer up.

A couple of weeks went by, and I still hadn‚Äôt heard anything from GVE London. Then one day, I received a parking ticket from somewhere eight hours away, up north. Shocked, I immediately called GVE London. They told me the car was still in their showroom and hadn‚Äôt been sold. They claimed my number plates must have been cloned and advised me to dispute the ticket. So I did.

At this point  five weeks after my car had already been sold, I was arguing with a parking company under the belief that my car was still with GVE London. Meanwhile, I could still see my car being advertised on their social media, Autotrader, and PistonHeads. I didn‚Äôt think much of it at first, because surely they wouldn‚Äôt still be promoting my car that wasn‚Äôt in their showroom.... right?

Another week passed, and then GVE London went into administration. That‚Äôs when I discovered my car had vanished. I immediately reported it stolen to the police, but by then, GVE London had completely shut down and no one was answering calls or emails even though David was informing the public they are still open.

To cut a very long story short: my car was eventually found, impounded, and taken from the person who had unknowingly bought it. The police investigated and ultimately returned the car back to me. In the five weeks that the buyer had possession, the logbook was never changed and no official paperwork was completed ,clearly done on purpose so I wouldn‚Äôt discover the sale. 

The police later put me in touch with the buyer, who wanted to speak with me and I eventually agreed because he had the service book and spare keys I needed back.

All I can say is the buyer is an absolute gentleman. An older man who had been searching for the perfect Aston Martin V12 Vantage for over four years. Mine was his dream car, and he was happy to pay above the asking price for it. He was driving his grandchild to the shops when armed police surrounded him and seized the car. He nearly had a heart attack.

He apologized for putting miles on the car and even for the parking ticket that was sent to me. He returned all the paperwork and spare keys to me, knowing full well he will likely never get his money back.

I‚Äôm sharing this story because I want George and David to understand the lives they‚Äôve destroyed through their lies and greed. Going bankrupt is one thing, but deliberately deceiving people and stealing their money is something else entirely.

When I discovered my car had gone missing, my life fell apart. I was later diagnosed with depression, and I can only imagine what the other victim went through too. I'm hoping by telling you this, it prevents others from being scammed by George and it encourages others to come forward to tell their story too. 

Even though I want to move on from this situation and I was the lucky one, I want to do everything I can to help the buyer get his money back. I since learnt David the owner of GVE London has fled to Dubai. Again I know this because one of my wife's work clients is David's best friend. So If anyone needs any help or information please reach out to me.

1o06qhm,2017 S3 CarPlay?,"Hi,

I've just purchased a used 8V S3. It has the Audi Smartphone option on the screen but no usb socket next to the 12v plug. I noticed on the previously connected devices that someone had connected via CarPlay. Does anyone know how I can also connect via CarPlay?

Thanks",1,1759816718.0,14,CartalkUK,1759952016,2025-10-07 05:58:38,2025-10-08 19:33:36,"getdtrick (Score: 2): I have 66 plate S3 and I believe all the facelift 8V S3 comes with carplay by standard, but wires only. There is a usb-a socket in the storage under the armrest. I plug my phone in there and the Audi Connect Option then changes to Carplay in the menu.

1o05g8m,Skoda Scalas seem expensive,"The Skoda Scala ticks a lot of boxes for me in terms of getting a lot of internal space for quite a compact car. I know car prices have gone through the roof generally but can't help but think they seem to be overpriced for what they are. They are not exactly a premium car. Any better alternatives to look out for?

An A3 is an alternative which looks nicer, interior is a lot better but it‚Äôs low on standard equipment. Mk8 Golf is good for standard equipment but people have issues with the infotainment. Honda Civic Hybrid is too expensive. 

What about the previous gen 2021 Honda civic, loads of boot space, leg room for rear passengers (not head room however), packed with every feature as standard- heated seats, adaptive cruise, reverse cam and it looks better subjectively - http://www.autotrader.co.uk/car-details/202509296732716?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios-app

The thing that put me off was the ridiculous spec options, which seems to be a feature of modern VAG cars.

I saw loads of examples of top level trims that didn't have climate control as it was an optional extra, even on that trim! I just thought it was mad that most of those Monte Carlo trim cars were 16k plus and just had manually adjustable air con!¬†"
1o024ck,Mercedes Benz A200 or Suzuki Swift Hatchback,"Alright guys we've got beauty and the beast here and I need advice on which to pick. 

I'm choosing between a 2018 Mercedes Benz A200 and a 2021 Suzuki Swift Hatchback. Both automatics. The Mercedes has 38,000 miles and the Suzuki has only 6,000 on the clock. Both are priced the same. My job involves A LOT of driving both in urban and rural areas.

In the research I've done it seems the Suzuki is a better fit however I've found complaints about its speed since it's such a small car. Also my main issue with it is that it's UGLY! it's boxy and boring with cloth seats. Whereas the Merc is much more stylish and comfortable looking, as well as having a lot more power. The issue with the Merc is I've read they're less reliable and aren't as efficient.

So do I buy the ugly reliable car with barely any mileage or the sexy sleek Mercedes with more miles and potential more problems?

What you're really asking here is ""Should I go for the sensible, reliable option, or should I go for the badge recognition and a bit of leather?""

I live between the UK and Iceland, mainly the latter, so when I come back to the UK to visit I'm always hiring cars. The A200 is on the cheap end of ""premium"" rentals, and I only made that mistake once. Immediately moved to a C-class on my next rental.

Sure, the interiors are nice, they feel ""luxury"" when you're sat in them, but unless you're looking at an AMG badged A-class, they can't pull a skin off a rice pudding and their engines are mated to either a 7 or 8 speed auto or a DCT which never knows what gear it wants to be in.

If I was in your position and was mainly relying on it for work then I wouldn't be thinking about ""sexy and sleek"" or what the car looks like to other people, I'd be thinking about something low mileage that I can rack up the digits on, and my first question would be when it does eventually have an issue, is it going to be cheap and simple to repair.

With a modern Mercedes, while they're nice cars to look at, the answer to that question is never yes once it's out of warranty.

Personally, for a work car I'd go for the Swift or look at something in between that's a happy compromise.

Ziemniok_UwU (Score: 2): Are there no other options? Surely something simple but proven like a Golf or if you want it to be more stylish Leon or A3 is a better choice.

If you absolutely must choose between those two the Merc is the better option but the 1.3L engine leaves a lot to be desired.

Car 2: newer 2017 but 1.0 L SE with 90k mileage. Still got service history and 2 owners only as well.

I heard these cars are not like Toyota or Honda that engines are reputable for reliability, and new models come out each year. Shall I choose the newer one with high mileage or old beautifully maintained with shorter mileage?
