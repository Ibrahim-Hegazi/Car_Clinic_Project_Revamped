I think the prices are excessive. You could get the cylinder head rebuilt rather than replacing with a new one. Thermostat housing and water pump would likely have easier access with the cylinder head off so that price seems very excessive. And likewise the turbo would need to come off to remove the head so it should just be the part with minimal labor. 

Is it possible that they are giving you a high price in the hopes that you will trade your car in for scrap value and then you would buy a new one?  Personally I would take this to an independent shop that perhaps specializes in VW or European vehicles and see what they charge for this work.

My Family Isn't Listening To My Concerns And I'm Worried About The Integrity Of The Car (specifically the engine),"My family owns a 2020 Kia Sportage. Recently we just ran out of the coolant. We couldn't get the coolant right away, so I did some research and learned that water is a good temporary solution for low mileage distances. After so much research and comparison, I finally found the coolant we needed. Before we left to Autozone, my sister poured a full xtra large polar pop cup of water in the coolant thing, when she had put half of that earlier. 

Her reasoning was because it had ran out fast, but had she not done that, the coolant thing would've gone empty fast like it did before. I was counting on that so we could just pour the coolant in. We open the hood and we see it's no longer empty, but filled with a dark blue liquid. Obviously the old coolant mixed with the water. We drive back home assuming it would go down when driving, but it didn't.

Doing more research, I learned if we don't drain the old coolant mixture, we could possibly break the engine. I was being very a adamant about the situation, but they swear it'll just ""run out"". Mind you the AC isn't working properly either with these issues I mentioned and I know that's not a good sign either. Please give me the best advice you can, and if possible is there a way for me to drain the coolant without having to jack up the car.

teknogroover (Score: 2): I would determine where the coolant leak is, first. You can rent a cooling system pressure tester from AutoZone or O'Reilly's for free, or purchase one on Amazon. This way you can pressurize the system when it's not super hot and look for the leak. Also check your oil to make sure there's no water/coolant in it. If there is, the oil will appear milky or like chocolate mousse. This would indicate a blown head gasket or cracked head or block and the coolant is being turned into steam. You exhaust will smell sweet and have steam coming out of the tailpipe. You can also get a test strip that you can dip in the coolant to check for exhaust/carbon, which would indicate a bad head gasket or cracked head/block. Once the leak is located and repaired, you can drain the coolant by locating the petcock valve on the radiator (usually on the drivers side and the bottom of the radiator), and unscrewing it to drain the coolant. To get the old water and coolant out of the block, you can remove the thermostat and flush out the block and head with a garden house. Then get some compatible coolant and mix it with distilled water 50/50, or get premixed coolant."

1mhrokv,"Intermittent Problem - No Start, No Sound","My Honda Fit 2015 (automatic, 120k miles) occasionally has issues with starting.

I turn the key, lights and radio come on but the car doesn‚Äôt start. No sound, nothing.
After a couple of tries (once it took so many) it finally starts.
I thought shifting to neutral while braking helped at first but not always.

It happened for the first time last month, for 1-2 days.
Then it stopped and I drove it normally.
Now it started again and I‚Äôm so scared of getting stranded.

Since it happens intermittently, how can the mechanic diagnose it? 

When I take the car to them, it might just magically work. Is it possible for them to visually diagnose the problematic parts?

The other problems remain: low steering effort, too much road feel from bumps, and the steering wheel requires excess travel to turn the car.

Sometimes the hoses delaminate internally, making it act like a one-way valve.  Brake goes on when your press it, but doesn't come off when you release.  This will mimic a sticking caliper even though the caliper is fine.  And this gets worse as the brakes get hot.  When they're cold they might work normally for the first few stops.

You can test this by trying to compress the caliper piston.  If you get a lot of resistance, try again but with the bleeder screw open.  A huge difference tells you the issue is upstream from the caliper, and it's usually due to the hose.

If you replace the hose, go ahead and replace the hose on the other side, since you'll have the system open and need to bleed it anyway.

1mhowb4,Chasing a Binding Caliper Issue,"2006 GMC 5.3 2wd - Binding driver's front caliper. Not enough to notice when driving, but enough to create enough drag to warp the rotor and create pulsating brake pedal. I did the 2019+ swap where I replaced the calipers, rotors and pads with the new model parts, plus braided soft lines. I wanted to do the upgrade anyway and figured this would most likely eliminate the problem, so 2 birds with one stone. It did not. Identical problem with new parts, so I know it's not in there, and it's isolated to the same corner as before, so it is somewhere behind the soft line in the system 

So now I need to really chase the problem. I am just not sure where the likely culprit will be. The only thing I can think of is the hard line for that corner or maybe the ABS module where the lines go in. Trouble is I don't want to have to do the ABS bleed with the computer every time I empty the system if I have to do it a few times. I have replaced the brakes numerous times without issues by just doing a vacuum bleed or having my son pump the brake pedal, but I always hear about how you have to do a ABS bleed with a scan tool.

1mhnakl,Help Me Solve a Mystery: Lexus 2007 RX 400h ‚Äì ABS Lights After Mass Airflow Repair?,"Hey all, hoping someone here can help me figure out what‚Äôs going on.

A few weeks ago, my 2007 Lexus RX 400h (3.3L V6 hybrid) stalled in the middle of an intersection. I coasted to a safe spot and had it towed to a local shop I‚Äôve used for basic maintenance.

They told me the mass airflow sensor had failed. I agreed to the repair. When I picked up the car, the dashboard was suddenly lit up with brake-related warning lights, and none of the power windows worked. These were not issues before the visit.

I asked what happened. They said they weren‚Äôt sure but now believed I needed a new ABS system.

That felt odd, so I had a mechanic friend scan it. He pulled codes **C1345** and **C1368**, and explained the brake learning had been ""undone"". He didn‚Äôt have the right tool to fix it, but said a shop with **Techstream** could likely perform the relearn.

I called another shop and confirmed over the phone that they had Techstream. After inspecting the car, they also told me I needed a new ABS system. When I asked if they had tried the relearn process, they said they used something else and recommended full replacement ‚Äî $2,000.

So before I spend that much, I‚Äôd like to ask:

* Could this really be a coincidence?
* Is there any connection between a mass airflow sensor and the ABS system or power windows?
* What causes brake learning to be lost?
* Should I keep searching for someone who will try the proper relearn process with Techstream?

I‚Äôm not a mechanic, but I respect the detective work involved in good diagnostics. Would really appreciate any insights from those who‚Äôve seen something like this.

Thanks.

I changed my gf's oil and it looked funny to me and had her take a video. I was worried about what felt and looked like metal shavings and we took the car to the dealership to be inspected. After the inspection the service person insisted that the video is normal and the mechanic checked the oil (the fresh one) and found no metal shavings. Furthermore, we took the old oil and said that it had very small and little specs of metal but told me that's normal. I asked for the old oil to be tested but told me that could not verify the old oil is actually the oil that came out from the car. 

They said that further inspection would involve inspecting the oil pan. They said there was nothing they can do at the moment and to have the next oil change there in order for them to inspect the oil since they need tangible evidence in order to warranty out the car. The car has a powertrain warranty up until 70k miles. How should I proceed? 

Some additional information: at 50k miles the car radiator fans would stay on for some time after the car was off. I noticed that the coolant level dropped and I topped off to the full line and hasn't dropped since. Eventually a CEL popped up for the thermostat and we got it replaced under warranty.

In other words, it's opaque, it looks like milk. In contrast, something like Pepsi is dark, but you can see through the bottle.

I wouldn't put too much faith in the dealership here because they simply aren't motivated to identify warranty issues. Warranty claims are paid for by the manufacturer at a below market rate. Not to be cynical, but if a major issue occurs out of warranty you can either buy a new car from them, or pay them to fix it. It's a win-win situation for them.

Personally, I would pay to send a sample to the lab. If they find coolant in the oil I would trust them. If the dealership only trusts samples they can verify came from this car what you do is very simple.  
1. drain the current oil from vehicle,  
2. refill the oil with the the old oil you just took out (the one the lab say has coolant in it), and  
3. drive to dealership say that the oil on the dipstick looks milky.

The oil + water slurry does not lubricate as well as pure oil, so the excess metal flakes you're seeing could be a result of this."

Are you hearing grinding when steering? Have you checked inner tie rods for looseness? Does your steering feel loose and is vehicle wandering back and forth? Wandering at higher speeds is also a sign.


Another thing is to check your struts. An easy way to test struts is pushing down on vehicle around hood and trunk. It should feel stiff. If it pushes down easily struts are generally bad.

Also the axles and wheel bearings. If you are hearing any weird noises or grinding or wobbling sounds in any of the 4 wheel areas when the wheels are turning your wheel bearings may be bad. The axles in the front wheels can also make noises when moving if axles are bad. 

There is a lot to suspension and impossible to diagnose whats bad and whats not via video. Suspension is hands on using feel, sight, and sound.

It has around 82k on it and the service book shows it's been looked after, serviced yearly including 4-5 of the services done at a VW dealer. The owner also serviced it prior to selling. 

Since purchasing it, I have noticed that the car, only on its first start up from cold, will idle rough when I do anything that adds any sort of load to the car. Pressing the clutch, turning the steering, turning on the AC. It will only do it once, after that it runs perfectly fine. It only lasts 4-5 seconds but you can feel the car shaking during this. After that, when the cars warm, no issues. If I let the car warm up and then do anything, no issues. 

It's just strange because there are no issues whilst driving apart from very very minor engine shakes as the cars idling, just the engine running. I'm probably being abit harsh on it but I can feeling the engine running compared to my brother's Mk7, again a 1.4tsi but it's an auto.

The error codes relate to the **pre-catalyst (upstream) oxygen sensor**, often called the **lambda sensor**. Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

# Code: 11351B: Upstream oxygen sensor heater circuit ‚Äì Resistance above threshold

The heater circuit in the upstream oxygen (lambda) sensor is showing too much resistance, which could mean:

* The heater element inside the sensor is failing or broken
* Wiring to the sensor has high resistance (corrosion, loose connection, damage)
* A problem with the engine control module (ECU) power supply to the heater**üîß**¬†



# Code: 013013: Pre-catalyst oxygen sensor bank 1 (Electrical test) ‚Äì Circuit open

The ECU has detected an open circuit in the lambda sensor wiring or the sensor itself, suggesting:

* The sensor might be unplugged or damaged
* There‚Äôs a break or corrosion in the wiring
* A blown fuse or faulty ground connection

  
**Status: ‚ÄúUnkritisch‚Äù = Not Critical**

Although these faults are not classified as critical (won‚Äôt immediately damage the engine), they can lead to poor fuel economy, increased emissions, suboptimal engine performance



# Recommendations:

1. **Visual inspection:** Check wiring and connector at the upstream oxygen sensor; look for loose, frayed, or corroded wires
2. **Test or replace the sensor**: The sensor heater circuit or the sensor itself may need replacement. Commonly, upstream sensors fail before downstream ones.
3. **Clear the codes**: After repairs, clear the codes and test drive. See if they return.
4. **Don‚Äôt ignore for too long**: While not urgent, this issue affects how well your engine runs and should be addressed soon."

1mhb3g0,Suzuki GS500F 2004 only running on 1 cylinder,"Bit of a particular situation that has a few variables, I'm looking to get thoughts from people before I start doing too much to it.  
  
**TLDR**  
One of my cylinders is struggling to idle, can only run both when starting with throttle added. 

**So before this:**  
Bike sat for 2 years with old fuel in the carb, I bought the bike, cleaned the carb, ran into a couple issues and basically the carb has new jets and I'm very confident it's healthy enough. It might need some adjustments but I do think it's clean and working.

I've also got:

* New sparks
* New air filter
* New oil/oil filter 

**The current issue:**  
So I can start the bike really easily with no throttle but it only runs on 1 cylinder just under 2k rpm.  
When it's running on 1 cylinder, if I add any throttle at all it will instantly kill the engine, no bog or rev just the slightest bit will outright kill it.   
  
If I start the bike with a good amount of throttle I get both cylinders to run and I can control it quite easily with the throttle, the response feels pretty good IMO.  If I then let the throttle off the bike will settle down and go back to running on 1 cylinder or potentially it has died on the come down as well once. The warmer it is the easier it runs and it might hold out on 2 cylinders a bit longer too..

**My lead suspects:**  
I definitely have an exhaust header leak, I've seen some smoke around it. One of the bolts were sheered before I got it and I've had the exhaust off and on. So I currently can't fully clamp down the exhaust header on that cylinder. It might also be below torque spec as I still need to get a smaller torque wrench. I don't think this \_should\_ cause these issues but it is also the only thing I know of that is different between the 2 carbs/cylinders.  
  
I also might need to adjust the idle mixtures screws and the idle rpm adjuster.   
Currently both the idle mixtures screws are at factory spec (3 turns out) and I havent touched the idle rpm adjuster yet. I think my next step should probably be to adjust these but I was somewhat concerned this might not be the right way to get around the issue. 

**Next up:**  
Those 2 things are currently in my plan of what to start looking at next but if anyone has experience with this and has anything they think is worth checking I'd appreciate some ideas.",1,1754307674.0,8,mechanic,1754422792,2025-08-04 11:41:14,2025-08-05 19:39:52,"PapaSmurfEgr (Score: 2): I had a siezed exhaust valve on mine, likely due to being dropped/ crashed by previous owner.

Using a T30 Torx screwdriver remove the two screws and the horn pad/air bag will pull out. It may be necessary to grip the screws with needle nose pliers and pull them out a bit more to clear the screw openings if the pad hangs up once the screws are loosened. 
Once the pad is off rotate the wheel and inspect for any loose screws or other components, once corrected reassemble in reverse order and reconnect battery cable.

I'm at the very beginning of building a dash cluster, I want it to display oil temperature and etc so I can get real temperature readings from the COMMAND unit and maybe activate some of the other AMG sensors that are hidden in the COMMAND system.

I had a quick look at some of the Youtube tutorials and quite frankly most people's clusters looked disgusting and far from anything that would look like it should be in a car like this.

While yeah, these cars have hit rock bottom it's also a future classic (barring electric cars) which I want to keep up to date with the modern world.

I also want to keep the original wiring cluster, and dash/stalk functionality so building a custom loom is completely out of the question. It's quite advanced enough as it is and has a fibre optic mess of wires anyways. My biggest issue with that is that it predates MOST so I'm quite limited to what hardware I can choose.

As you can see so far I've chosen deliberately not to try to shove an aftermarket head unit in and I'm running Vanilla Android 14 on an ARM Cortex-A7 with 2gb of RAM (essentially a Raspberry Pi 2 for want of better analogies)

At present all the sensors work including the door sensors, etc, and I have installed front and rear cameras, as well as a rear reversing camera making it about as modern as any other car.

I have many another app/connectivity including Spotify, Google Maps, Waze and Google Home, although I haven't quite figured out how to get Google Assistant to respond even though there are multiple microphones to choose from.

When its connected to my phone via USB or WIFI I can get it to do everything including opening the garage door.

The biggest nuisance value without rewiring literally everything is the outdated COMMAND system vs. MOST that would be in a car just 2 years younger. While symbolically they look compatible extrinsically speaking the bus and the bandwidth available multiplies significantly enough that they're incomparable.

I feel like Alice tumbling down the rabbit hole taking on this project. Redoing the entire loom from a 2005+ car is not really on the question of things I want to entertain.

Unfortunately it's a game of this vs. that the 2.6 litre M112 is much more reliable than its later 3.2 and even 3.7litre versions and there is a reason to the madness in choosing this car vs. one in Australia that was never recalled for an engine design fault that could cost $15k odd to redo if the wrong thing were to break. 

The 2.6litre M112 also retains the reliability of dual timing chains, and comes with the 5 speed auto that is very sedate and quite capable of powering an AMG55 by comparison, so it's very under tuned and probably the last well built Mercedes until about 10 years later.

My name is not Tvarsish and I don't want a bunch of unfinished projects including a McLaren and a Porsche that will probably never legally see the road again.

1mhqtcq,Power Loss + White Exhaust From 1 Tailpipe,"**Summary**

My 1994 GT (5.0) mustang randomly had a huge loss in power, clunky acceleration, and rich white smoke from driver side exhaust.

I initially thought it was an injector, so I have injector cleaner in my gas tank. That's most likely why the right side is a little smokey. That, or it's the H pipe on the dual exhaust. I wish I could tell you whether or not it smells like super rich exhaust vs. exhaust with coolant, but I don't trust my nose there.

I recently had the radiator, thermostat, and hoses replaced. That came with a coolant flush and top up. Interestingly, leading up to this issue, I had a low coolant light come on (right after the replacement) leading me to think I was burning it. Unfortunately, I didn't visually see how much my reservoir had at the time of the radiator service, so I don't know where I started vs. where I was before adding more coolant when the light came on.

**Considerations**

* Idle is ""ok"" even with slight acceleration in park, but when I took it for a half mile drive around the block, there was a ***cloud of white smoke behind me*** and the engine was chugging pretty bad.
* Cylinder 5 piston has more gunk than the other 7 which are generally spotless. This is in line with the theory that bank 2 is where it's occurring (driver side exhaust). I inspected cylinders with a borescope during my leak-down tests.

**What I've already tested/checked**

* **Seafoam injector cleaner** via gas tank
* **New sparkplugs** (while I was checking to see how the old ones looked - nothing too telling)
* **Leak-down test (2x)** \- 85-90% pressure retained making me think it's not head gasket. I used a borescope to get all pistons to TDC before using a reputable leak down test kit. I was actually very surprised how well these tested... maybe too good? Did I do it wrong?
* **Lower intake manifold gasket** didn't appear to be the cause either, but I haven't installed the new one and put it back together yet. Up until this point, my theory was this gasket had a leak at the water jacket. See this video: [Lower Intake Gasket Before Removal](https://imgur.com/a/sU3jcU9)

**Theories**

* ""It can't be injectors since exhaust is white and not black.""
* ""it can't be head gasket because leak down test was good twice in a row.""
* ""It doesn't appear to be the lower intake manifold gasket due to it's in-tact appearance.""

What do you think? I'm happy to add more media and

Those the smoke colors, and yours is white. 

5-10% on a leak down is a healthy engine, and you seem to be just on the wrong side of that. Consider reporting the actual cylinder by cylinder results from each test. 

At any rate, 20+% is a major issue, and 10-20% is something relatively small but that could get worse with time. You might be right in the middle of that ‚Äúworsening‚Äù.

A cooling system pressure test would be worth doing, but I guess you‚Äôve taken the manifold off which changes things.

Hi everyone,
I made a mistake when installing my winter wheels on my BMW 120d F20 (rear-wheel drive).
I accidentally mounted them diagonally ‚Äì mismatched widths and offsets between left and right.
The MFK inspection in Switzerland flagged it, and now I want to correct it properly.


---

üõû Wheel specs I have (OEM BMW):

8.0J x 17 ET34

8.5J x 17 ET37
(All four tires: 225/45 R17 94H M+S)



---

‚ùå Current (wrong) configuration:

Position	Wheel	Offset

Front left (FL)	8.5J x 17	ET37
Front right (FR)	8.0J x 17	ET34
Rear left (RL)	8.0J x 17	ET34
Rear right (RR)	8.5J x 17	ET37


They are mounted diagonally instead of symmetrically by axle.


---

‚úÖ My plan to fix it:
Swap front left ‚Üî rear left, resulting in:

Axle	Wheel spec	Offset

Front (FL & FR)	8.0J x 17	ET34
Rear (RL & RR)	8.5J x 17	ET37



---

üîç What I want to confirm:
Since both sets are technically compatible, which one is meant to go in the front for a correct OEM staggered setup on a BMW F20?

Should I run:

8.0J ET34 in front and 8.5J ET37 in rear
or

8.5J in front and 8.0J in rear?


I assumed the narrower/shallower offset wheels (ET34) go up front, and the wider/higher offset (ET37) go on the rear to compensate for rear track width ‚Äî but I‚Äôd like confirmation before I fix this.

1mhnuyp,I recreated a voice AI that cut return trips by 80% for a mobile mechanic ‚Äî curious if tools like this could work for others,"Not sure if this is the right place for it, but I‚Äôve been working closely with a few mobile mechanics and wanted to share something that‚Äôs been kind of surprising.

A recurring issue I kept hearing was how often they‚Äôd show up to a job with the *wrong part*. Customer says ‚Äúcar won‚Äôt start‚Äù ‚Äî you assume battery, turns out to be starter. ‚ÄúWeird noise while braking‚Äù ‚Äî turns out to be CV joints, not pads. Now you‚Äôve burned time, gas, and the customer‚Äôs side-eyeing you like you didn‚Äôt ask the right questions.

So I built a voice AI that acts like a smarter intake assistant. It picks up when the customer calls, walks them through a series of short but targeted questions (like: ‚ÄúDo you hear a clicking when turning the key?‚Äù), then texts the mechanic a quick summary and likely cause before they leave the shop.

One of the mechanics using it recently said this cut his backtracking trips by around 80%. He actually made an extra $3,200 in 3 weeks because he could knock out more jobs without losing time to part runs or misdiagnosed calls.

It‚Äôs not perfect ‚Äî still testing and tweaking ‚Äî but it got me wondering:

# Would something like this actually be useful to others here?

* What‚Äôs your process for diagnosing over the phone?
* Do you usually just bring a few parts ‚Äújust in case,‚Äù or trust your gut?
* Would you use something like this, or prefer to talk to the customer directly?

Totally open to criticism, feedback, or ideas. Not trying to sell anything, just geeking out on solving a common problem and trying to learn from people who do this every day.

1mhmk5l,what's wrong with this caliper?,"this caliper doesn't slide straight. it pivots on one slide pin slightly, the upper half sliding in more than the lower half. in the video, I press and release the pedal twice. press... release, press... release. the problem is more clear the second press/release, towards the end of the video.

also, the caliper applies too much clamping force when not applying brake pressure. it is extremely difficult to spin the hub in its current configuration.

in addition, the upper outer retaining pin, when fully seated, makes contact with the rotor (making a terrible noise). it seems as though the bracket is too close to the rotor somehow on the upper half, almost as though it's seated badly. see picture: [https://imgur.com/a/xzt5gWq](https://imgur.com/a/xzt5gWq)

I apologize for the angle in the pic. when you look at the bracket + rotor dead on, it seems as though the upper half (or at least the pin) is closer to the rotor than the lower half. I have not yet compared to my FR (this is the FL) but that one definitely does not make the noise.

I did not install this bracket and have not serviced it.

I just rebuilt my front calipers. cleaned the two bores on the bracket, replaced and greased the slide pins, replaced the slide pin boots (one-piece tube on the bottom, two-piece cap and sleeve on the top), cleaned out the bore and replaced the piston boot and seal (there's just a single piston). and replaced the pads, which were down to the groove + new hardware (just the four pins). both sides of the rotor (on this side) have light rust rings (you can see it in the pic). I think something was seized up before. prior to this job, I was getting barely any stopping power.

when I spin the hub I get a mild tumbling rocks sound, so probably the wheel bearing on its way out. but the hub does not move or wobble (I attempted to wiggle it by hand). the rotor 'seems' pretty smooth and flat to me after running my finger on it and watching the runout via the upper pin, but maybe I'm missing something.

First thing I did was check pressure. The first pic is the reading with the compressor disengaged. I jumped the compressor at the relay to get it to engage and the needle dropped to mid green HOWEVER as you can see in the second pic refrigerant started spraying out the high side port.

Also of note the AC did blow cold out the vent with the compressor engaged. 

I checked for continuity in my low pressure and high pressure switches. The readings were 002 for the low switch and 005 for the high. I also checked for power to my relay and I swapped out the relay with a known good one. No problems there. 

The last thing I did was jump the high pressure switch to see if I could get the compressor to engage that way but it would not. Same with the low. Any thoughts advice or direction to search next? I can do the work myself but I‚Äôm limited on my diagnostic abilities.

Additionally, the car has been driven for 100 plus miles since with no issues or code after the install. Car feels super smooth actually.

Long story short, is it easy to cross thread spark plugs, and will there always be symptoms associated with this problem?

Of course if you did, it's not likely to be a problem until a) your next spark plug change, at which point it's just time for a new head, or b) one or more plugs randomly shoots out of the head.¬†

1mh43c3,Three lug that nuts wont budge on one tire?,"Hey there, I got a question to pick y'alls brains about.

I got a 2017 Subaru Forester around 53k miles, 2.5 Automatic. I did a brake change a few days ago, and got three of the four done. But on the front driver's side tire, there are three of the five lug nuts that either wont budge, or they move very slowly as if they're stripped or something. 

We bought this car a year ago, and this is the first time replacing them. We haven't had a single reason to remove that tire (or any of them) until now. It got some front end suspension work done by a local shop a few months ago, but it was only on the passenger side. I just can't figure why they'd have to take it off either. 

\[Backstory: I'll admit outright that this repair was due to my negligence, and a very expensive lesson to learn, and one that could have seriously injured my wife if not worse. I didn't put the front right tire on correctly after an oil change (I can't remember why I needed to take it off, but regardless...), and after driving on it incorrectly mounted for a few months, noises developed which prompted a diagnostic from the shop mentioned above, and they found that the right side (CV?) axle, struts, and more needed replaced. They verified this with video and photographic proof, and two days later it was done.  I take full responsibility for this, and considering it's primarily my wife's car, I still feel horrible for the safety risk it put her and any of her would-be passengers in.\]

Either way, I can't figure out how to take them off without feeling like I'm going to snap something, and we haven't driven it out of precaution. What could this be? And realistically, is it something simple I'm missing? I have no problem taking it to a shop if it's out of my wheel house.

These installers are in stock at most auto parts stores. Pull the brakes back off, and there is a notch to get the studs in and out. Get an extra lug nut to use as your installer nut. Use a breaker bar with a cheater pipe to break the old lugs off. Hammer, the broken studs out thru the notch. Install the new stud, put the stud instaler over it, grease the threads, use the nut, and an impact to run it in until flush. After you have installed all the new studs, clean them up with brake clean and dispose of the installer nut. Reassemble the brakes, install the wheel, and torque the new lugnuts down to 75ftlb.

1mh2v2r,When the hell to change oil?!,"Hi. Frustrated with the diversity on information on the internet. Just bought a well loved 2002 GMC Yukon at nearly 195000 miles. She runs pretty great, does not seem to be burning oil whatsoever, I already put a 1000 miles on. The handbook writes I should change the oil every 3000 miles, the previous owner was to be on top of the maintenance and topped off the oil himself. 

However, after reading online now the opinions differ, especially since this is a 23 year old vehicle, I am assuming the quality of oil had changed? Is it perhaps now vehicles can last 5000 miles+ without an oil change because the quality of synthetic is better? Or is it best to just stick to what the manual recommends, be better safe than sorry and change the oil every 3000 miles like it says.

 I do mostly country driving, nearly no city driving. I plan on taking her 1000 miles cross country because I will be moving in October. I want to be on top of the maintenance as best as I can, I think I could maybe get another 100000 out of her before shes in for.

I replaced the front left lower control arm following this video. https://youtu.be/_3qZVsvAoW8?si=Hog8JfylIoAJv8iQ. No problems there. I needed to tighten axle nut to 180 lbs/ft but my torque wrench only goes to 150. I reattached the front right wheel and lowered it before going to buy a torque wrench. I saw the store was closed so I decided to torque it to 150 and then do a quarter turn with a breaker bar. I got a lot of resistance and heard a semi-loud click before the breaker bar had moved much. I thought maybe I had over tightened it with my impact (Bauer Battery). Also I was not using a pry bar to stop the wheel or apply the brakes. Reminder the other front wheel was on the ground.

I was able to remove the axle nut, and I retightened to 150, for certain this time, then used the breaker bar with brakes applied and I was barely able to tighten it further, and no clicks or anything.  I drove it around and on highway and didn't hear/smell anything unusual. Its the click sound made when tightening that worries me.

A couple things:
1. Beforehand I knocked the bearing off the axle(sorta?) with a punch following the video.

2. I was tightening the front left while the front right wheel was attached and lowered.

3. I did not stop the wheel from spinning with a pry bar or the brakes the first time I put the axle nut on.

Best suggestion, take it to a shop versed in electric diag and request a parasitic draw test.

Keyless entry systems are the most active, if you leave a key close to the vehicle it might be keeping communication active be a use it can sense the key. Move any spare keys that might be close, it could simply be an issue where it's reading the key and trying to respond the way it's designed to.

Ran into some pretty heavy traffic, going back and forth between 5mph and 50mph every other minute. I got around a clump of traffic and sped up towards my exit ramp, going about 65-70mph, and all of a sudden got death-wobble levels of shaking in my steering wheel, manageable enough to steer through the off-ramp and slow down, but just barely, (I always drive woth one hand but I went 10 and 2 so fast lol, probably my first time since drivers ed). I parked the car and checked it out, lots of brake dust on the rim, smell of burning brakes, and immense heat coming from the front passenger side. Let it cool down for 10-15 minutes, then finished the last 30 minutes of my drive on backroads. Yesterday, I took a look at it, and for the life of me could not figure out what the issue is. Rotors, pads, caliper pins, wheel bearings, all seemingly in good shape. No leaks or cracks in the brake line, compressed the caliper piston with a clamp, it compressed with a normal level of difficulty, and reengaged when pressing on the brake pedal. I figured it must've just been some crazy fluke that caused the shaking the day before, so I put it all back together, took it for a test drive, hit 75mph, no issues, no shaking, so I figured it was some random happening or whatever, and that it was fine. But then I took it back out today, it was fine for the first stretch of driving (70mph avg.), but then the issue came back after hitting some heavy stop-and-go traffic again. So my 3 hour drive turned into a 5 hour drive having to take state highways instead of interstate freeways lol. I can drive up to 60mph before the shaking starts, and if i haven't used my brakes in ~15min., I can get up to 70 with no issue. But as soon as i consistently use my brakes for a couple minutes, the shaking starts back up at high speeds again. I'm assuming its something with the caliper piston, or my master cylinder, but I am by no means a traoned mechanic, and would really appreciate some advice. 

TLDR: Front right brake having issues releasing pressure after moderate use when travelling at freeway speeds. No visible/obvious issues with pads, rotors, caliper, brake line, or wheel bearings.

Noticed there was slight wheel play on my RH wheel, not side to side play but if I grab the wheel and pull away from the car. Both tie rods were replaced along with the CV joints so I am ruling that out.

I have removed the wheel to find the cause of the clicking and noticed that the rotor was ever so slightly loose. Removed the rotor and everything else is solid, no other play on the knuckle or tie rods. Is the loose rotor the cause of my wheel play?

1mhth07,I feel like my Ford Focus is a lemon but mechanic says it‚Äôs mint?,"Hi al

Just after some quick advice if I can. I‚Äôm on my third Ford Focus and I absolutely hate this one, to the point where it‚Äôs the last Ford I‚Äôll ever buy. That being said I‚Äôm relatively skint so don‚Äôt have the luxury of getting a new car. My focus is a 2017 1.0L 125bhp petrol eco boost. Main problems I have with the car are:

1. Generally weak performance. It‚Äôs worst when the engine is cold and sometimes when setting off from a junction in 1st gear I have my foot flat to the floor and it can take literally 5 seconds to actually get going. 

2.  When the aircon is on the car feels even less powerful. If I‚Äôm driving along with aircon on and I take my foot off the accelerator, the car literally starts engine braking. Also when the aircon is on, the car NEVER gets to the correct engine temp. Soon as I turn the aircon off, the temp gauge goes to 50% as it should do. 

3.  Odd fuel usage. Unless I drive like an absolute old lady, the car is horrendous on fuel. At its absolute worst I could set off from my destination with the car saying 50 miles to empty, drive 1 mile and the car says 46 miles to empty. It‚Äôs literally like there‚Äôs a hole in my fuel tank. I also notice strong smell of petrol fumes if my car is turned on and I stand at the back. Like it‚Äôs running rich?

4.  Clunking noises from front suspension when going over potholes. Definitely getting worse. I also notice clunking noises when I stop, go into reverse and put full lock on. Also sometimes when I come up to a roundabout and use engine braking, when letting off the clutch there is a strong ‚Äúrusty‚Äù noise like a rusty lever being released? 

With all these wonderful /s features my car has, it is also approaching 10 years old and has done about 55,000 miles. So I‚Äôm fearing the timing belt is going to need changing. 


Does anyone know from the above issues, is the car a complete lemon and not worth spending a penny on, or should I have these issues looked into along with the belt?  I can‚Äôt understand how the mechanic said the car is mint. It‚Äôs easily the worst Ford I‚Äôve ever had. I knew it should be crap by the state of the Ford Huddersfield garage I got it from. 

Thanks for any input!

Don't trust the mileage estimate to be perfect, it is just that, an estimate. It'll update all the time depending on the MPG and speed you're doing. For all their faults, ecoboosts are generally very economical engines (at least in the fiesta, maybe it's a focus thing being heavier)

Suspension clunks means you need some bushings or ball joints replacing, normal wear items for a car. Drop links maybe? Track rod ends? Bottom arm bushings/ball joint?

All in all you've described just a handful of things that are either non-issues or normal car things. Yes, it is the dreaded ecoboom, and that'll be costly to replace, but that's your biggest issue.

I‚Äôve never leased before , and I‚Äôm slightly put off by not owning the car and a large outlay on doing so, however having a brand new car without the immediate depreciation is appealing as well as reducing my tax liability (I‚Äôve just knocked into 40% tax on part of salary).

How healthy is your pension? Does your employer offer salary sacrifice into your pension via AVCs? Maybe consider getting a cheap car and upping your pension contributions instead, that ¬£700/month can have a huge impact on your pension health. Just a thought :)

I pondered the same question three years ago, in so far as I earn ~¬£80-85k inclusive of bonus.

I stopped at our tyre place on the way back and they checked the balance which they said they didn't need to change anything on, so it's not an unbalanced wheel either. No sign of uneven wear according to the dealer and tyre shop either.

I'm inclined to think it is a wheel bearing that's on the way out, but just isn't quite showing other physical signs yet. Or, it's just something I haven't noticed before and it's part of the car's normal road noise!

Firstly, it definitely could be a wheel bearing that's not bad enough to be draggy or audibly rough sounding rotating the wheel by hand.

There are a few ways to try to detect this, it's worth watching some videos online but they involve things like stethoscope type tools to listen and see if the bearing is too rough sounding through them.

Another thing to consider, do you also get the rumbling (or a bit louder than usual) if you take a fairly sharp/hard corner where that wheel is on the outside? This can also be the early symptoms of a wheel bearing starting to wear.

It could also be a lot of other things though. Even things like tyres. Unless you've got a vehicle that runs staggered fitment and asymmetric tyres you could swap wheels around and see if the noise moves. Tyres can and do develop faults although it's not common.

As for what to check mechanically, it could be anything else anywhere that rotates including in the gearbox etc and noises can be transmitted in weird ways through the body and mean that they actually originate somewhere different from where they sound like they do. It's difficult to advise every check over the entire car.


I'd suggest taking it to a competent, local mechanic rather than the dealership or a fast fit tyre chain if you are not experienced at finding these things yourself.

I understand in these circumstances the lease company (Lex in my case) automatically pays the FPN and then charges me, along with their admin fee.

1mhc63g,"Vauxhall Movano Overheated - Head Gasket Gone, Garages Refusing to Fix - Need Advice","Hi everyone,

I'm in a difficult situation with my Vauxhall Movano (2019, 2.3L Diesel, 91,000 miles) and would really appreciate some advice. It's a campervan conversion that's currently half-finished, so getting rid of the vehicle isn't a great option as it will be hard to sell, and likely worth a lot less than a fixed, full conversion.

The van overheated recently, and I pulled over immediately. After waiting, I found a broken radiator hose, which a recovery operator temporarily fixed. **However, before the repair, he instructed me to drive the van for about 5 minutes (around a mile) with little to no coolant to get to a safer parking spot.** He then ran the engine for about 5 minutes to flush air from the system after the repair. I then drove for about 20 minutes to top up the coolant, but as soon as I opened the cap, a mixture of coolant and oil started leaking from the bottom of the engine.

My local garage has confirmed the head gasket is gone, but they, along with close to 20 other garages I've contacted, are refusing to take on the repair. The reasons vary, but it's proving impossible to find someone willing to do the job. Some have even suggested a new engine is the only real solution, citing concerns about a warped or cracked block.

I'm now weighing my options and would love to hear from anyone who has experience with a similar issue.

My two main paths seem to be:

1. **Find a garage to replace the head gasket.** This is proving incredibly difficult, and I'm concerned about the long-term reliability if there's an underlying issue like a warped engine block.
2. **Go for a full engine replacement with a refurbished unit.** This is a more expensive, ""nuclear"" option but might be the best bet for a reliable, long-term fix, especially given the van's camper conversion status.

Has anyone dealt with this on a Movano, Renault Master, or Nissan NV400 (they're essentially the same vehicle)? **I'm particularly worried about the damage caused by driving it without coolant.** What would you recommend in this situation? Are there specialists I should be looking for? Any advice on how to find a garage willing to do the head gasket repair, or what questions I should be asking about a refurbished engine, would be a huge help.

Thanks in advance!

**TLDR:** My 2019 Vauxhall Movano overheated. A recovery operator made me drive it without coolant, and now the head gasket is gone (confirmed by a garage). I can't find a garage willing to fix it. Should I keep trying to find someone for a head gasket replacement or just get a new engine? Looking for advice, especially regarding the potential damage from driving it while overheated.

1mh8kll,"Not car savvy, keen on an affordable hybrid SUV with comfort in mind - MG vs DS?","Hey guys, 

As the title says really, me and my partner are looking to upgrade our day-to-day car and we're looking at hybrid SUVs around ¬£15,000. 

After a fair bit of looking around, we've narrowed our two favourite car choices down to either an MG HS T-GDi and a DS DS7 / Crossback. 

Neither of us are too fussed about driving a car that feels amazing to drive and is super high-spec, ultimately we're both after something that feels a bit more comfortable and luxurious on the inside after we've both driven our cars from 2007 into the ground.

Looking for some general recommendations for those of you that have driven both, or might own one of these. From what I can see, the MG's are everywhere and it's not at all difficult to pick one up at a good price, whereas the DS7 is a bit harder to come by, especially one with upgraded interior specs we really liked.

It might sound daft, but one the biggest pull for us is interior mod-cons. A good-sized and useful infotainment systems, decent phone charging options and space. The DS has a panoramic sun-roof which appeals as well.",0,1754298795.0,15,CartalkUK,1754422792,2025-08-04 09:13:15,2025-08-05 19:39:52,"JATAA- (Score: 6): MGs are the least reliable brand of car and also occupy the least reliable electric car spots (WhatCar Survey, pinch of salt it), my sister has had a terrible time with hers, having had to go to the garage for fixes 5+ times in 12 months.

1mh5iug,Buying diesel but doing low mileage,"Hi, I understand that the general consensus around buying diesels is that it‚Äôs only advised if doing high mileages. However, I‚Äôve found a diesel vehicle which is cheaper than its petrol counterpart (for whatever reason?). It‚Äôs also cheaper to tax. Mileage will be around 5k a year and will be driven on motorways most weekends. 

Is it still not recommended to buy a diesel given the above?

You say low mileage. What is that 10 miles a day? 15? 

Or 5,  1,000 mile trips per year.

Or is this DPF related 

I commute about 15 miles a day but my car does not have a DPF, so it doesn't really matter. No DPF to block. 

My grandparents probably do 1,000 miles a year, in their diesel car with a DPF, about once a month a member of the family with working eyes will take it on the dual carriageway and do 80 mph in 4th, for 10 mins.

I do a few short journeys during the week and then it goes for a long run either on the weekend or every 2 to 3 weeks. In the three years I've had it I've noticed it doing an active regen one time. Zero issues in those 3 years with this usage. You just need to be mindful of how many short journeys you've done without something longer to break those up and give it a chance to clear itself out. It's one of these things that gets blown out of proportion a bit, the cars can take care of this stuff themselves unless you're really just never going for longer drives at all.
