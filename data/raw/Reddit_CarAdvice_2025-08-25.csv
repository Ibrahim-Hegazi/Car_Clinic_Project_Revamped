1mzb2p2,What are my options with this alternator?,"The vehicle is a ‚Äò99 (90s body) GM Yukon SLT with a 5.7L vortec engine. The past week or so when starting the engine it was a bit hesitant but started up, until yesterday when it died on me while out running errands. Got it jumped, went to an O‚ÄôReillys and they scanned the alternator and battery (pictures included) and determined the alternator has a bad voltage regulator and has been messing up the battery as well. I pulled the alternator (a Delphi Automotive Systems) and found a part number (15750871N 130A I believe, also pictured) and I‚Äôm thinking it might be the original one(?). This car also has under 200K miles FTR, and it previously had a second auxiliary car battery hooked up to it in the bay that ran extra grill guard lights while turned off, but that was removed many years ago. 

My primary question is should I look at getting the current Delphi alternator rebuilt locally and reinstall it, or would it be better to buy a new or remanned alternator? And if I should buy one instead, what places do y‚Äôall recommend and what brands do y‚Äôall recommend for this vehicle/engine? I‚Äôve been reading about O‚ÄôReillys $179 Ultima but am not finding good reviews on it. The Delphi I haven‚Äôt found a lot on but people seem to consider it reliable. I am also on a bit of a budget here.

It also controls your shift interlock and brake switch, so that is why you can't shift gears and it won't start.

---

**Hi everyone,**

I'm hoping you can help me unravel a persistent issue with my Toyota. I'm a British expat who shipped my car to Somalia for retirement, and local specialist expertise is hard to come by.

---

### **Vehicle Details:**

*   **Model:** 2010 Toyota RAV4
*   **Engine:** 2.2L D-CAT Diesel (Reg: YB59 FYS)
*   **Location:** Somalia (Ambient temp is hot, ~30¬∞C)
*   **Background:** The car was undriveable for 6 months due to suspected injector failure.
*   **Mileage:** 74,000 miles

---

### **What Was Done:**

1.  Initially, **one injector was replaced**, but the car **still would not start**.
2.  Finally, **all four brand new injectors were installed**. This worked ‚Äì the car now **starts and idles fine** with engine running no weird sounds or noise.

---

### **The Current Problems & Steps Taken:**

Before getting it running, I used my OBD tool (**launch x431 elite 2.0 pro for Toyota**) to complete the necessary software steps:

1.  Cleared the **""Pilot Quantity Learning Values""**.
2.  Entered the new injector compensation codes into the ECU via the tool's appropriate menu. **(I am confident the codes are correct and entered in the right cylinder order)**.
3.  Initiated the **""Pilot Quantity Learning""** process.

**Here is where I'm stuck:**

---

#### **Problem 1: Stuck Learning Process**
The pilot quantity learning process **refuses to start properly**. The OBD tool shows the conditions for the test. All show **""Ready""** except for **""Pilot Quantity State"" which shows ""Wait""**. The tool has been stuck on this for **over 40 minutes** (it should take 2-10 mins). Online forums suggest the ECU is waiting for perfect idle conditions, but everything seems fine (no rough idle, good temp)?

*   **Troubleshooting Attempted:** I've tried revving the engine slowly to 3k RPM, holding for 1-2 seconds, and repeating 5-10 times to give the ECU data. **No change.**

---

#### **Problem 2: Persistent P1601 Code**
The error code **P1601 Injector Compensation Code** keeps **immediately coming back after being cleared**. This happens even though I'm certain the new codes are entered correctly and saved.

---

#### **Problem 3: Dashboard Warnings**
The **""Check 4x4 System"" warning** is **permanently on the dashboard**. This first appeared 6 months ago when the injectors originally failed and the DPF was an issue (the DPF was fixed 1.5 years ago). The light **does not clear with the OBD tool** and remains even with the new injectors installed and codes are cleared. An **engine warning light** is also present.

---

#### **Other codes present:**

*   **P1497** ID 0X000C1497 not defined!
*   **P1601** Injector Compensation Code
*   **P1497** Intake Air Temperature Sensor 1 Circuit High
*   **P1601** EEPROM Error - Injector Correction Value, DPF Thermal Degradation Record
*   **P1604** Startability Malfunction
*   **C1280** Engine Control System Malfunction

**Why is p1601 code coming twice once for eeprom error‚Ä¶ and one for P1601 Injector Compensation Code?**

UPDATE

I drove the car since, it idled fine and the codes above were still present, so when I tok it out on the road it felt like it was missing 10% of its usual power and after 20mins of driving  it would not get past 2000rpm when before during the first part of the drive it would rev to any rpm. I am not sure what this suggest and what the cause of this is, is it codes coming up and the injector not being programmed properly or something else?

---

### **What I Need Help With:**

1.  What could cause the **""Pilot Quantity Learning"" process to be stuck on ""Wait""** and how to fix this?

2.  Why would the **P1601 code persist** if the injector codes are entered correctly, what possible reasons could make this code appear and how can I fix this? I have checked and entered the codes for injectors many times and saved them but maybe there is something I am missing, doing wrong if anyone can point to the right directions and tips to get this code gone and the ecu accepts the new injectors codes and this fault codes goes away ?

3.  What could the **""Check 4x4"" warning** be, from past issues,dpf and injector, it appeared when these issues arose and it still is there despite the car now starting what could this be suggesting now and how to get rid of it if it is an issue.

4.  Are there any **specific live data parameters** I should check with my OBD tool that might shed light on this?

It sounds like it could still be a discharged battery. I would try attempting to jump/boost the battery before attempting to start the engine. If it cranks over and starts, make sure to place the battery on a charger, as running the engine is usually not enough to recharge a weak battery.

 Also check to see if any inside/outside lights were left on accidentally. It is worth making sure that the alternator is charging the battery. 13.6V - 14.2V is normal output from the alternator. Anything less may cause the battery to drain over time. Hope this helps!"

The only way youre going to get this done cheap is to do the work yourself or have a family/friend that is competent with repairing cars help you. 

If you cant afford the repair, then you can open a line of credit somewhere. Many automotive franchises have their own credit cards. The repair isnt any cheaper but they will let you pay it in installments (with interest)

As far as the car overheating,   
1st step: would be to inspect your coolant level, car cold and off. It has a cold fill line and hot fill line. The coolant system should never be inspected when the car is hot.   
2nd step: You can turn on the AC and look at the fans. Both fans should immediately turn on, car cold, and running.  
3rd step: Wait for the car to reach half temp, car running, ac off. Once the car reaches half temp one fan should kick on.  If at any point it starts to creep past halfway just shut the car off.  
  
Depending on your inspection it may give you a basic idea of why its overheating.    
  
You already know the car overheats and you should know that driving an overheating car can cause catastrophic engine damage. Running the cars heat system through your hvac will work as a ""mini"" auxilary radiator to help displace heat but it is not an answer to your problem.

As much as I hate the platforms, nextdoor or facebook for your area might be a possible resource to connect with someone who can help you.  Also if you have a community college in your area with an automotive technology department, maybe talking to an instructor there may be of help.  Last, ask around with your coworkers.  Maybe there's someone where you work that knows car repair.  

Do you have coolant in the radiator?  If not, it could be a leaky hose or radiator.  If you do, perhaps the thermostat.  Does it blow white ""smoke"" out the exhaust pipe?  If so, perhaps a head gasket which would be a major repair.  Also, borrow an OBD2 code reader and see what code it's giving.  That may give you a hint regarding the problem but no guarantee.  
Last, if you google ""2013 Kia Optima SX. overheating"" you will find some YouTubes discussing your problem.  

Final warning is that it only takes about 3-5 minutes for a car to come up to operating temperature.  Driving it beyond that can cause catastrophic engine damage.

1myj2ea,"With a 10ma draw, the battery keeps dying. WTF?","Hey folks,

A little under a year ago I bought a 1989 RCSB Chevy C1500, 4.3L.

When I went to test drive it, dude had to jump it. I came back with cash & he'd put a new battery in it for me. Date tag is May 2024. Sweet of him.

Recently it started draining the battery when I'd let it sit. I could drive it a while, park it, and start it back up - but two days later, it's dead. 

Today I took it off the charger and it started fine. I then drove it a little ways and shut her off. Getting back in the car maybe 90 minutes later it cranked really slow, reading about 10v on the dash, and just barely got started. 

Gauge on the dash says we are right about 14v while running. I drove a while, let her run for \~30 minutes or better, shut it off. Within a couple hours it's down to \~ 10-11 volts and just barely started up again. OK, draw on the battery seems to be worse somehow?

Here's the thing - I hooked a DVM up between the battery and the cable. It's only pulling 10ma or so. I wiggled a bunch of connectors, pulled the cigarette lighter, pulled the glove box bulb, pulled the dome light & map light bulbs and said a short prayer... but all the while, it's only pulling 10ma.

---

**Hi everyone,**

I'm hoping you can help me unravel a persistent issue with my Toyota. I'm a British expat who shipped my car to Somalia for retirement, and local specialist expertise is hard to come by.

---

### **Vehicle Details:**

*   **Model:** 2010 Toyota RAV4
*   **Engine:** 2.2L D-CAT Diesel (Reg: YB59 FYS)
*   **Location:** Somalia (Ambient temp is hot, ~30¬∞C)
*   **Background:** The car was undriveable for 6 months due to suspected injector failure.
*   **Mileage:** 74,000 miles

---

### **What Was Done:**

1.  Initially, **one injector was replaced**, but the car **still would not start**.
2.  Finally, **all four brand new injectors were installed**. This worked ‚Äì the car now **starts and idles fine** with engine running no weird sounds or noise.

---

### **The Current Problems & Steps Taken:**

Before getting it running, I used my OBD tool (**launch x431 elite 2.0 pro for Toyota**) to complete the necessary software steps:

1.  Cleared the **""Pilot Quantity Learning Values""**.
2.  Entered the new injector compensation codes into the ECU via the tool's appropriate menu. **(I am confident the codes are correct and entered in the right cylinder order)**.
3.  Initiated the **""Pilot Quantity Learning""** process.

**Here is where I'm stuck:**

---

#### **Problem 1: Stuck Learning Process**
The pilot quantity learning process **refuses to start properly**. The OBD tool shows the conditions for the test. All show **""Ready""** except for **""Pilot Quantity State"" which shows ""Wait""**. The tool has been stuck on this for **over 40 minutes** (it should take 2-10 mins). Online forums suggest the ECU is waiting for perfect idle conditions, but everything seems fine (no rough idle, good temp)?

*   **Troubleshooting Attempted:** I've tried revving the engine slowly to 3k RPM, holding for 1-2 seconds, and repeating 5-10 times to give the ECU data. **No change.**

---

#### **Problem 2: Persistent P1601 Code**
The error code **P1601 Injector Compensation Code** keeps **immediately coming back after being cleared**. This happens even though I'm certain the new codes are entered correctly and saved.

---

#### **Problem 3: Dashboard Warnings**
The **""Check 4x4 System"" warning** is **permanently on the dashboard**. This first appeared 6 months ago when the injectors originally failed and the DPF was an issue (the DPF was fixed 1.5 years ago). The light **does not clear with the OBD tool** and remains even with the new injectors installed and codes are cleared. An **engine warning light** is also present.

---

#### **Other codes present:**

*   **P1497** ID 0X000C1497 not defined!
*   **P1601** Injector Compensation Code
*   **P1497** Intake Air Temperature Sensor 1 Circuit High
*   **P1601** EEPROM Error - Injector Correction Value, DPF Thermal Degradation Record
*   **P1604** Startability Malfunction
*   **C1280** Engine Control System Malfunction

**Why is p1601 code coming twice once for eeprom error‚Ä¶ and one for P1601 Injector Compensation Code?**

---

### **What I Need Help With:**

1.  What could cause the **""Pilot Quantity Learning"" process to be stuck on ""Wait""** and how to fix this?

2.  Why would the **P1601 code persist** if the injector codes are entered correctly, what possible reasons could make this code appear and how can I fix this? I have checked and entered the codes for injectors many times and saved them but maybe there is something I am missing, doing wrong if anyone can point to the right directions and tips to get this code gone and the ecu accepts the new injectors codes and this fault codes goes away ?

3.  What could the **""Check 4x4"" warning** be, from past issues,dpf and injector, it appeared when these issues arose and it still is there despite the car now starting what could this be suggesting now and how to get rid of it if it is an issue.

4.  Are there any **specific live data parameters** I should check with my OBD tool that might shed light on this?

5.  **Is it safe to drive with P1601 and incomplete Pilot Learning?** my logic is If the injectors were not ready to drive surely the car wouldn't idle and rev so smoothly. It feels fine, so are these codes just procedural hurdles, or are they actively telling me something is wrong that could lead to failure

1mysi9r,EPS light on - power steering WORKS BUT DOES NOT turn off after engine is turned off EPS = Electric Power Steering,"[](https://www.reddit.com/)

EPS (Electronic Power Steering) light on the dashboard = problem with the car's electric power steering

The power steering works perfectly without any problems.

\*\*\* The problem occurs when I turn off the engine.

\- The electric power steering remains active! This means that it will drain my battery very quickly. Normally the power steering should stop when the engine is turned off. When I remove the key from the ignition, the car cuts off the power to the 12V socket, radio, headlights BUT the power steering is still active.

\* Temporary solution that only works until the next start and turn of the steering wheel:

\- Disconnect the car battery and reconnect it.

So the power steering is deactivated when the engine is off as normal.

I can start the engine, the power steering works, I can turn off the engine and the power steering deactivates as normal and everything is fine and good until I turn the steering wheel more. I can move it left and right but not too much.

The problem reappears if I start the engine AND TURN THE STEERING WHEEL MORE (half a turn) then the EPS light comes on, the power steering works without problems but when I turn off the engine the power steering remains active.

Something keeps the power steering active even if the engine is off.

In the best case, there is a relay hidden under the dashboard (I haven't seen it) that no longer turns off the power supply. In the worst case, there is no such relay but in fact the computer on the steering column receives continuous current normally and it decides and can turn off the power steering power supply, only now it doesn't turn it off anymore. The power steering turns off if I remove the battery terminal and put it back. I start the engine, the power steering works and if I don't move the steering wheel much (I turn it less than half a turn) the problem no longer appears. I can turn off the engine and the power steering turns off too. If I turn the steering wheel half a turn then the EPS light comes on, the power steering works but it continues to work even after I turn off the engine and even after I remove the key from the ignition. The battery voltage in this situation drops rapidly by 0.01V every few seconds. Unfortunately I don't think the car battery has a problem or is it to blame.

\^ What else could I check? What could it be? If it's the power steering computer, what part of it?

I want to start with the cheapest and easiest things to check.

For example I checked the fuses and they are good + the MAIN relay which is good.

I used a tester with the OBD 2 socket under the dashboard, it didn't show any errors, it's a cheap KONNWEI KW310 tester and anyway the EPS errors can only be read through the diagnostic socket under the hood which has a proprietary port ""Kia/Hyundai 20-pin diagnostic connector"" and I don't have an adapter and even with an adapter I might be limited to finding some codes.",1,1756032773.0,3,mechanic,1756150330,2025-08-24 10:52:53,2025-08-25 19:32:10,"Next_Movie_98 (Score: 1): https://preview.redd.it/uvupu5g27ykf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b911beafcd2ae918824b2d6c63b65b5be6e458d

1mz45iu,Multiple potentially dumb questions about cars in general,"So I‚Äôve now been driving for about 2 and a bit years and have been coming up with some questions which I do want answers to yet cannot find any. 

Question 1
- Can cars have personalities or off days? 
I drive a 2014 Ford Ecosport with a 1.0 liter EcoBoost engine (not the most reliable engine but the car had 8K when we got it and we‚Äôve been maintaining him well) and I actually feel as though my car does not feel the same everyday. It‚Äôs always fun to drive but on some drives he feels a lot more snappy and forward than other drives even to the point where I have to watch my speed more than other days. Other drives I can get in and immediately feel if he‚Äôs going to be a bit harder to get going. It happens with different fuel levels and even on the same day so doesn‚Äôt feel like a fuel or maintenance matter. 

Question 2
- I‚Äôve noticed that some cars have a white light (usually where the fog lights or DRL lights would be) that turns on in the direction of the turn when the car is turning (I do not mean the blinkers or indicators) but I haven‚Äôt been able to find the name of this function. Would anyone know this name? 

Question 3
- A while ago the oldtimer (Ford Fiesta MK2) of someone I know had a flat battery due to some lights being left on. I carry jumper cables in my car kit together with some other stuff so I have read about how to use those but so did he so he used his cables to connect my Ecosport to his Fiesta without me seeing how he did it. I had turned my car off after parking it closer to his so he could connect them. I had always read that the donor car should first be running for a bit (sometimes even with some throttle) to give enough life to the other battery. However I hadn‚Äôt even turned on my car yet when he already went to turn his car on and the battery worked again so now I‚Äôm kind off confused about how this was possible.",3,1756061855.0,35,StupidCarQuestions,1756150330,2025-08-24 18:57:35,2025-08-25 19:32:10,"Unfair_Valuable_3816 (Score: 6): question 1, air density will do this especially for turbo cars, on cool days air is denser and the intercooler is colder meaning it can produce more boost = more power.

RestaurantCandid5274 (Score: 3): Hello, VW technician here.

1: The Ford Ecotech engines are small 3 cylinder turbo engine with high compression thanks to a turbo (a compressor that forces more air into the engine using the exhaust gases). These little engines can feel a little rough due to variables (outside temperature, oil quality, engine temperature). It's possible you have a small engine issue that you don't need to worry too much about. Try to put higher octane fuel only in the car if you live in the USA, to avoid clogging fuel injectors and the filter. Always follow your service intervals.

  
2: This function on VW is called ""Cornering Lights"", I assume they're called the same for all brands.

  
3: Newer cars can boost an older car, but it's not recommended to do it the other way around, if you're not sure how to do it. Due to sensitive electronics in newer cars, there is a ground point connected to the cars main ground bus, so you don't freak out the central electronic control unit or blow a fuse/control unit (the control units are small simple computers that control the cars different electronic functions via CAN bus technology, old principle but very reliable in outside conditions).

How it works is basic electric theory, once a voltage and current is applied it's there in full and attempt to start the dead car. If the dead car doesn't start, the battery is dead and needs to be replaced. I believe it's something about the nominal charging process, battery cell condition or something like that.

  
This is all general stuff off the top of my head and might be off here or there. I hope it helps!"

I'd get the 94Ys, since you have 94Ws,

The number is the weight rating. You'd be safe with even the 91s, but they will wear a little differently than the 94 and you're a little better off being all the same. Weight number is times 4, of the lowest number. Your car weighs about 1,500 kgs, so you have plenty of weight to play with.

 The letter is the ""Speed rating"" - the max speed at which the buildup of heat won't damage your tire. You're not going to be doing anything at all like the max speed. Keep them on the same axle, even when you rotate to back, and you'll be very fine. Ys are safe at higher speeds than Ws, you'll be even more safe.

Don't worry too much about these, it's the tire size - 225/45 R17 - that needs to be exactly right.

Make Honda  
Model Civic Hybrid  
Engine 1.3 L  
Mileage 120k miles

I posted here a while ago. All the other codes cleared up. I did also open the C101, threw some electrical cleaner at it and then this remained.

Thus far I have also gone to the AC clutch connector. Using Alldata, provided by my local library, this is essentially pins 11 (GRN) and 12 (BRN) on clip B of the climate control unit (i.e. CCU) which effectively makes it way to the 3-wire AC clutch connector and 11 -> 1 (BLU/RED) and 12 -> 3 (RED).

The doc says to check for continuity between those wires, as in 11 to 1 and 12 to 3. I found that 12 to 3 was open. I have a tone prober and traced it to a wiring harness just right of the 4th ignition coil. Almost center of the engine bay.

Now comes the weird part, this wire doesn't do anything special, so I jumped it from the CCU all the way to the 3-wire. It still doesn't turn on. AC light comes on but no AC. Clutch also doesn't engage.

The AC fuses and relays are fine. I tested them and can also jump the relay to make the clutch engage.

Anyway, when I look deeper into the schematics, I see that the CCU essentially ""grounds"" wire 12 (i.e. 3 on the AC clutch connector) to ""activate"". So I then jumped wire 3 direct to ground. Clutch still doesn't activate and no AC.

Looking further at the schematic it almost seems like the compressor has its own relay and fuse. I'm not sure but this is a wiring diagram and it does show the entire path, I would imagine it may show the path to the fuse relay with a little surrounding box but it doesn't.

Basically, any help here would be appreciated, from all the diagnostic steps I have, this could be an open or the CCU is bad. Unfortunately I can't find where to replace the CCU even from Honda OEM parts suppliers. I have confirmed the open between 12 and 3 but I also jumped it which as far as the schematic says, should be sufficient.

Also using the Honda AC (i.e. recirc + rear defrost), I get what I believe is 5 blinks ... or 6 blinks which means:

5 - A problem in the mode control linkage, doors, or motor (I do have the car door open when doing this)  
6 - A problem in the blower motor circuit (I don't know if this is true because the blower motor blows stuff)",1,1756067479.0,5,AskMechanics,1756150330,2025-08-24 20:31:19,2025-08-25 19:32:10,"tuphluv (Score: 1): Also, I did have to remove the top shield to get to the C101.

I just don't remember if I pushed down or pulled up. I think I pulled up to open it from the engine bay in which case, any tips or tricks would be great :-D

tuphluv (Score: 1): It's the CCU and or something bigger, hoping not the compressor because that was B2989 and that went away after a long drive and some electronic parts cleaner.

Essentially the Alldata diagram for the layout regarding B2992 diagnostics was wrong but as I mentioned, Alldata also has the wiring schematics.

Following the wiring schematics I tested with my tone prober BRN and GRN, to C101 and then all the way to RED and BLU/RED AC Clutch 3P successfully. Then I also did a resistance / continuity test by using telephone cord that was just coiled up in the house. Put two ends in the CCU B ports to the actual BRN and GRN wires and carried it over to AC Clutch 3P and tested it there.

So going to give that a shot. The only other item I want to test is the AC PSI sensor but I think I need to back probe that as I can't read it real time w/ my OBD. If anyone knows if ThinkDiag 2 can do it, LMK. I know it's a subscription, but scan tools are pretty handy.

car starts when being jumped. but the donor vehicle needs to be revved quite a bit for it to actually turn over my vehicle.

battery: it's brand new and has been tested, always good, always fully charged when i'm working on the car. so i'm ruling it out as the issue.

starter: the car starts when jumped so I'm just going to rule it out as being a bad starter, for now. also, i did put a new starter in it at some point on this journey and that didn't work either so i returned it.

what the car does when it isn't being jumped: turn the key, the starter clicks, doesn't crank at all. just a click. immediately followed by power dying to the entire car. after a few seconds power comes back on its own.

what i've done: voltage drop test on the positive lead of the starter, test light goes out when the key is turned. this indicates a voltage drop. tested for solid ground connections and they all seem fine.

my thoughts: somehow the starter isn't getting enough power from the battery unless it's being given extra juice. i did clean and reapply the leads to make sure it was all tight and connected well. however maybe the wire itself has weakness somewhere else along the line. i mainly wanted to know if this even makes sense as a possible culprit. i'm learning, thanks!",1,1756061831.0,6,AskMechanics,1756150330,2025-08-24 18:57:11,2025-08-25 19:32:10,"NickRMX6 (Score: 2): DIYer advice: Try this (unless you've already tried it): connect one end of the black jumper cable to the negative battery terminal, and connect the other end to the engine block.

About 60,000 mi now since my last brake change my right rear caliper was frozen and it damaged the rotor. So I redid the rear brakes and found out that one pin was completely Frozen in place. I had to buy a new caliper bracket assembly. 

I found this odd since I use this permatex all the time. On the other side of the car , I noticed the pins seems rather sticky, so they got a cleaning and new 20353. This made me paranoid about my front brakes. So I checked them as well and I have a large amount of pad left on all four pads. They are wearing evenly. 

However, the pins were very difficult to rotate and pop out of the caliper. I cleaned them and relubed them with the 20353. 

This makes me wonder just how good this permatex is.... I think had I let this stuff go one of the front pins would have locked up as well.

Backstory: I bought my 2002 Sub Forester after it had been stolen (and recovered). So the ignition needs to be replaced. I've put it off for financial reasons and have just been starting the car by turning the ignition switch (circled in purple on picture). To access it, I have to swing the metal arm that locks the steering wheel in place. It accidentally rubbed the back of said ignition switch, causing a spark and shutting the car off (see result in other picture).

Now there is zero power to the ignition. I turn it and there is no sound at all. The dash lights are still WORKING. I checked all fuses under the dash and in the relay box under the hood. Couldn't jump it, so I don't believe it is a battery issue.

I'm not educated on this, but I'm wondering if the ignition switch is just fried. Any best guesses or advice?

A little background, may or may not be relevant but about 2 months ago I noticed the AC wasn‚Äôt blowing very cold and was slowly getting not at all cold. I used one of those recharger kits you can get at autozone and it worked just fine.

Now today I get in the van and start driving, AC blowing just fine in Auto mode. But only 30 seconds into the drive the fan just quit. I could put my hand over the vents a feel cool air trickling out but without the blower, then ineffective AC.

The first thing I did was to switch from Auto mode to manual and turning the know to see if the fan would go at all, and it didn‚Äôt. After a bit I noticed the back seat fan was blowing just fine.

At this point I figured maybe I blew a fuse and so easy fix. I turned the system off and kept driving.

A couple minutes later I figured I‚Äôd try again and turned it back on in Auto mode. Suddenly the fan was blowing but only hot air. (Auto mode was set to 69 degrees with outside temp near 90 deg.)

What you can see in this picture here is a gold chain that belongs to my father. Long story short: it‚Äôs an incredibly important family hairloom my father wore every day for the past 50 years which he inherited from his father. A few weeks ago the chain broke on him and while driving and he put it on the dashboard. Apparently he had to brake which made the chain slide in the direction of the windshield and ultimately ending up inside the air vents placed right under it. After a few hopeless tries of getting in there or theorizing where the chain could be, we bought a camera to see what‚Äôs goin on down there. After passing some tunnels, various foams and two vent flaps (for which I have to turn the ac on in order to open them) I reach the heat exchanger (?) where I finally found it. My father was very relived it didn‚Äôt fell out. But now we‚Äôre faced with the problem of getting it out. I can‚Äôt describe how hard it was getting to this stage since I have to jam 50cm (20inch) of cable inside of that mofo in the right way and at the end I have basically no control over the camera anymore. It‚Äôs a miracle I could even take a picture of it. I tried getting in there again with a makeshift hook/magnet combination on the camera with no success. (Ik gold ain‚Äôt magnetic but apparently there‚Äôs another attachment on the chain which is according to my dad is ‚Äûnormal metal‚Äú whatever that is).
So after weeks of fishing around in there, asking friends/mechanics I‚Äôm still not an inch closer to a solution. I was told to get to the heat exchanger the normal way is a bitch and a half. We would need to pay 1000-2000 euro in a workshop to get them to get that thing outta there because apparently it takes a day minimum to get there since you‚Äôd have to remove aaaalll kinds of stuff to get to that area. It‚Äôs literally in the worst place it could‚Äôve gotten in the car. I can‚Äôt stretch enough how desperate my father is to get that chain back (obviously). It‚Äôs gotten so bad he‚Äôs physically sick from the stress it causes him of not having this chain around him. Thursday my parents go on vacation they saved a lot for but as I said, my fathers a mess. And it would mean the world to him getting it back in time and we simply can‚Äôt afford to put so much money into a workshop getting it out for us‚Ä¶ so here I am, asking the good people of reddit if anybody has any friggin idea how we get that chain back on his neck.

Fieroboom (Score: 1): The oil galleys to the cam phasers are very small, and over time they get partially clogged with carbon - especially if the owner wasn't absolutely religious about oil changes - so they rattle at startup due to lack of oil flow. Then, as the engine warms up, the oil gets hotter & thinner, which flows through those partially clogged galleys much easier, eliminating the noise.


You can try adding ATF or a cleaning agent (like SeaFoam etc) to your oil to see if you can dissolve that buildup; you might need to do it several times over several oil changes."
1mypkif,2005 Nissan Navara 2.5L coolant or gasket issue,"Hello Reddit. After some advice on a Navara coolant or gasket issue please.

About 1.5 months ago, my 2005 Nissan Navara 2.5L (diesel, right-hand drive, single-cab) was showing hot on the guage. There were no visible leaks so I topped up the coolant and everything was good.

It recently showed hot again, but this time I could see coolant leaking. There was some dripping coming from the metal block that the bottom radiator hose plugs into. There is also some minor pooling higher up on the engine. (In the pictures)

I took it to a mechanic who said it was a head gasket issue. He doesn't have the time to fix it, so I thought I'd check Reddit's opinion before taking it elsewhere. 

Some other info - It still runs cool when topped up. The coolant and engine oil are not milky. There is no white smoke when starting or running. There is no bubbling out the radiator cap when running.

Not keen on spending big money if I don't need to, so please let me know if I need to start weeping.

STD = Standard lead-acid battery

AGM = AGM battery (absorbed glass mat type)

Amperage Selection ‚Äì The switches with ‚Äú2A, 6A, 30A, 100A‚Äù let you choose the charging current. Use a lower current (2A or 6A) for slow, safe charging and maintenance, or a higher current (30A or 100A) for faster charging (but this is more aggressive).

Other times it's hard to tell if they're being applied or not.  But I'd like to know when the brakes are being applied. 

I'd like to mount a small LED on the inside of back hatch so I can glance in the rear view mirror and see when the brakes are being applied.  I'm assuming that the brake lights go on when the Cruise Control applies braking force. 

Is this practical?  Is it as simple as tapping into the brake lights on the rear, or is it more practical to run something off the fuse panel up front?

Desperate help needed 

---

**Hi everyone,**

I'm hoping you can help me unravel a persistent issue with my Toyota. I'm a British expat who shipped my car to Somalia for retirement, and local specialist expertise is hard to come by.

---

### **Vehicle Details:**

*   **Model:** 2010 Toyota RAV4
*   **Engine:** 2.2L D-CAT Diesel (Reg: YB59 FYS)
*   **Location:** Somalia (Ambient temp is hot, ~30¬∞C)
*   **Background:** The car was undriveable for 6 months due to suspected injector failure.
*   **Mileage:** 74,000 miles

---

### **What Was Done:**

1.  Initially, **one injector was replaced**, but the car **still would not start**.
2.  Finally, **all four brand new injectors were installed**. This worked ‚Äì the car now **starts and idles fine** with engine running no weird sounds or noise.

---

### **The Current Problems & Steps Taken:**

Before getting it running, I used my OBD tool (**launch x431 elite 2.0 pro for Toyota**) to complete the necessary software steps:

1.  Cleared the **""Pilot Quantity Learning Values""**.
2.  Entered the new injector compensation codes into the ECU via the tool's appropriate menu. **(I am confident the codes are correct and entered in the right cylinder order)**.
3.  Initiated the **""Pilot Quantity Learning""** process.

**Here is where I'm stuck:**

---

#### **Problem 1: Stuck Learning Process**
The pilot quantity learning process **refuses to start properly**. The OBD tool shows the conditions for the test. All show **""Ready""** except for **""Pilot Quantity State"" which shows ""Wait""**. The tool has been stuck on this for **over 40 minutes** (it should take 2-10 mins). Online forums suggest the ECU is waiting for perfect idle conditions, but everything seems fine (no rough idle, good temp)?

*   **Troubleshooting Attempted:** I've tried revving the engine slowly to 3k RPM, holding for 1-2 seconds, and repeating 5-10 times to give the ECU data. **No change.**

---

#### **Problem 2: Persistent P1601 Code**
The error code **P1601 Injector Compensation Code** keeps **immediately coming back after being cleared**. This happens even though I'm certain the new codes are entered correctly and saved.

---

#### **Problem 3: Dashboard Warnings**
The **""Check 4x4 System"" warning** is **permanently on the dashboard**. This first appeared 6 months ago when the injectors originally failed and the DPF was an issue (the DPF was fixed 1.5 years ago). The light **does not clear with the OBD tool** and remains even with the new injectors installed and codes are cleared. An **engine warning light** is also present.

---

#### **Other codes present:**

*   **P1497** ID 0X000C1497 not defined!
*   **P1601** Injector Compensation Code
*   **P1497** Intake Air Temperature Sensor 1 Circuit High
*   **P1601** EEPROM Error - Injector Correction Value, DPF Thermal Degradation Record
*   **P1604** Startability Malfunction
*   **C1280** Engine Control System Malfunction

**Why is p1601 code coming twice once for eeprom error‚Ä¶ and one for P1601 Injector Compensation Code?**

UPDATE

I drove the car since, it idled fine and the codes above were still present, so when I tok it out on the road it felt like it was missing 10% of its usual power and after 20mins of driving  it would not get past 2000rpm when before during the first part of the drive it would rev to any rpm. I am not sure what this suggest and what the cause of this is, is it codes coming up and the injector not being programmed properly or something else?

---

### **What I Need Help With:**

1.  What could cause the **""Pilot Quantity Learning"" process to be stuck on ""Wait""** and how to fix this?

2.  Why would the **P1601 code persist** if the injector codes are entered correctly, what possible reasons could make this code appear and how can I fix this? I have checked and entered the codes for injectors many times and saved them but maybe there is something I am missing, doing wrong if anyone can point to the right directions and tips to get this code gone and the ecu accepts the new injectors codes and this fault codes goes away ?

3.  What could the **""Check 4x4"" warning** be, from past issues,dpf and injector, it appeared when these issues arose and it still is there despite the car now starting what could this be suggesting now and how to get rid of it if it is an issue.

4.  Are there any **specific live data parameters** I should check with my OBD tool that might shed light on this?

BMW 1 series will most likely have been ragged to shit by a boy racer at that price point. Also bear in mind they are rear wheel drive, not a problem (in fact more fun) but they can be harder to control in the rain/snow, especially if you have shit tyres.

A-class Mercedes = overpriced and poor quality for the money. 

I‚Äôd be looking at a VW Polo/Golf or a Seat Ibiza/Leon, possibly an Audi A1/A3 if you want to pay a premium for the badge. Bear in mind all these models are also quite popular with young drivers who like to rag them so make sure to check condition, service history, etc. 

Alternatively the safe, although slightly more boring choice, as others have already pointed out is a petrol Japanese hatchback, Toyota Yaris/Corolla, Honda Jazz/Civic, Mazda 2/3. Maybe even one of the Korean brands like Kia or Hyundai.

I'd give this a watch first and decide whether a 530e or 520i is better for you. There's no point in getting the 530e unless you plan on regularly using the plug in charging

The 545e has a 3.0 engine with an electric motor, in reality it won't be that great on fuel compared to the 2.0 520i or 530e. There's also not many 545es around to buy as they're quite a niche car. But if you're after performance then it might be a good choice. I'd say with that choice it sort of defeats the purpose of having the 3.0 engine if you're only going to use the electric motor however, so this option probably isn't as good for lots of mileage"

This one will use the M20 engine which is known to be reliable, the belt being changed a couple of years ago is a bonus. Officially the schedule for the belt was 25k miles or 4 years whichever is sooner, but you should probably change it more frequently than that.

Check to see if the auto box has been serviced. It's a ZF 4 speed unit and they're relatively tough but need looking after.

Check for rust, they can go around the sills (especially if they have a sunroof), the door bottoms and opening areas such as the fuel cap and the boot lid.

Service history is key on any old car, expect to see stacks of paperwork and receipts to show it's been looked after, especially at the price they're asking.

How can I verify that he's actually a dealer and not a private seller flipping cars, and they have necessary insurance? Who is responsible for the car being taxed? (Test drive location is a residential address. Family business bla bla.) Also can they ask for a photo of my licence? I don't mind showing them but a bit weary of anyone I just met taking a photo of my license. Thanks!",1,1756014833.0,12,CartalkUK,1756150330,2025-08-24 05:53:53,2025-08-25 19:32:10,"Slideways027 (Score: 8): If you want to do business with a dealer because of the extra consumer rights you‚Äôd have after purchase, then maybe one with at least ‚Äúplausible deniability‚Äù isn‚Äôt right for you.

Business premises, with a business name over the top, may be better.

The Certificate of Insurance, complying with the Road Traffic Act, will answer the motor insurance question. Any difficulty or unwillingness to show you that would be another red flag.

1myid14,Best Golf to go for under ¬£8k?,"Which Golf should I get under ¬£8k?

I‚Äôm looking to buy a VW Golf auto with a budget of around ¬£8,000. Ideally, I‚Äôd like one built after 2014, but most of the ones in my price range are either:
	‚Ä¢	Higher mileage (80k+ miles)
	‚Ä¢	Lower spec
	‚Ä¢	Or Japanese imports

Would it make more sense to go for an older, higher-spec model instead? Is 80k+ miles still fine if the car has been looked after? And are Japanese imports generally worth considering?


If anyone has any other auto recommendations would be great. I‚Äôve also considered a civic or a polo",2,1755997417.0,9,CartalkUK,1756150330,2025-08-24 01:03:37,2025-08-25 19:32:10,"Natural-Voice-840 (Score: 4): If looked after it‚Äôs gonna be fine,I have found golfs as very reliable cars,mine is at 126k miles atm and runs like new,try and get one from 2016 and after as that‚Äôs when you can have car play too,in general I have noticed people say that manuals are more reliable even tho from my experience since it‚Äôs an auto it never had problems,having driven polos and civics I‚Äôd say golf has the best handling IMO out of the 3

Good luck!
