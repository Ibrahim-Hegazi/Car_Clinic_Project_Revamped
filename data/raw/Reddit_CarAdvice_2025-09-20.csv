1nlg4mm,Car problems progressively getting worse,"Could use some opinions on what may be happening to my car. It is a 2017 VW Tiguan S 2.0/4L AWD with 93k miles on it. Here's a ~~brief~~ long history of the last few weeks:

  
8/29: Replaced spark plugs. Previous spark plugs weren't the cleanest, but no excessive oil found in/around. One of the spark plugs had a small piece of the ceramic missing. Like 1/8""-1/4"". Not sure what to do about that specifically, so just monitoring. Car feels fine and normal after replacement though. Started normally, all gears felt normal. There may have been a few 'hiccup' feeling moments, but I attributed that to using new spark plugs/my car feeling like that in general (what I mean about a 'hiccup' is like maybe 0.1s of what feels like lost power. From what I can tell, this happens during gear shifting).

9/1: Drove back home after the weekend, about 3.5 hours and 180mi. Car felt normal the entire time.

9/2: Car started just fine, drove about 50ft, EPC light and check engine light started blinking intermittently. To be clear, not blinking quickly or at a specified rate. Blinking interval looked random to me. Car felt like it was losing mechanical power in spurts during this time. Kind of jerking/jolting with the change in power. Car idles perfectly fine. Reverse feels normal as far as I can tell. Have not tried getting the car past first/second gear. Parked car back in my spot and started to look for what was happening (I suspected something spark plug related because I had just replaced them). When I had parked my car back in my spot, no EPC light or check engine light were illuminated. Obviously, popped the hood and starting looking around for anything obvious. The only thing I found was this very odd hose between my center two coils. The item is 06H133583G, as listed on the side of it. It is a ""fresh air hose"". Literally no idea what it is or what it does, but the yellow-ish filter(?) looking substance on the inside was cracked and falling out. That was the only thing I found to be out of normal (have not ordered a replacement as of writing this).

9/6: Have not driven my car still. Decided to check the gap on the spark plugs. Cracked two of the coil connecter plastic pieces so ordered a few new ones. Noticed a decent bit of oil on the base of my far left spark plug. Did not seem too excessive, but questioned why there was any oil coating the threads of a newly installed spark plug. Anyway, checked the gap and they were all about 0.029"", VW specifies 0.032"" so widened the gap a hair. I doubt that small discrepancy would have created this issue.

9/12: Still have not driven car. Replaced coil connection plastic pieces and decided to test car again today. Car felt normal for the first 50ft. Same issue happened as on 9/2. This time, however, my car died. Battery light illuminated, no more driving power. Coasted in neutral back into my spot and it's been sitting there since. Car will not start. EPC fully illuminated and stayed on. Check engine light not on.

9/19: Checked the spark plugs again today. No excessive oil in the left one. Small carbon buildup on the bottom sides of the plugs but does not go further than like a thread or two. I think this is normal. Replaced the battery because it was about time anyway. Put some dielectric grease on the spark plug boots. Car still won't start. Does not click like the battery is fully dead, rather it sounds like it's trying to start. I've had this happen on a previous car and smacking the starter motor with the handle of something during ignition usually helps. This component is buried in my car, so that's unfortunately not a test I can perform.

I am not sure what the issue could be. I convinced myself it's a spark plug issue, but now it won't start. I thought maybe I had accidentally unplugged something while toying around in the engine bay, but inspecting with a mirror and flashlight yielded no results. The excessive (maybe) oil on one of the plugs was making me think it could have been a misfire issue created by oil leaking through the liquid valve cover gasket rtv seal.

1nlfl16,Toyota Prius: replacing fuel pump sending unit for CEL EVAP code,"Hoping for a sanity check on a 2016 Toyota Prius (\~129,000 miles) diagnosis and quote from a Toyota dealership for a persistent P1422 (EVAP Small Leak) code. I'd appreciate your thoughts before I approve a costly repair.

**Issue:** Check Engine Light came on, showing the P1422 code. I tried tightening and then replacing the gas cap, which did not resolve the issue. I took it to my local independent mechanic, and their diagnosis was: ""Test EVAP system valves and solenoids. No signal getting to EVAP vent valve -- need to go to the dealer.""

Following their advice, I took it to the Toyota dealership. They performed their own diagnosis, including multiple smoke tests, but couldn't find any leaks from underneath the car. They then recommended dropping the fuel tank for inspection, and after I approved the labor, they found the issue.

**Dealership's Final Diagnosis & Quote:**

* **Finding:** ""Fuel pump sending unit is rotted. It requires new fuel pump bracket and fuel pump O-ring.""
* **The Quote:**
   * Labor to drop tank & diagnose: **\~$600**
   * New Fuel Pump Sending Unit: **\~$1000**
   * New Fuel Pump Bracket: **\~$50**
   * New Fuel Pump O-Ring/Gasket: **\~$60**
   * **Total Estimated Cost: \~$1710**

**My Questions:**

1. Does the dealer's diagnosis of a ""rotted"" fuel pump unit make sense as the cause for the P1422 code, especially when my local mechanic mentioned a ""no signal to the vent valve"" issue? Could these problems be related?
2. How does this dealership quote look for the job? I know it's a labor-intensive repair, but I'm trying to gauge if the cost is in the right ballpark.
3. Is replacing the entire $1000 sending unit assembly the correct procedure for this issue, or could just the bracket and O-ring be replaced?

1nlevei,"Issues with an electrical fuel pump, hopefully y’all will have some ideas.","So the vehicle is a 1966 F100.  It’s got the 300 l6 with a mild cam, headers, and an intake with dual Weber carbs.  

The carbs only want 3 psi otherwise it can push past the needle and seat, from what I’ve read.  So from the carbs I have a fuel distribution block, and from there is a fuel pressure regulator.

From the fuel pressure regulator, I’ve got a hard fuel line that goes from the engine bay down to the fuel pump.  The fuel pump is a jegs 555-15942.  I used a painless fuel pump wiring harness (50102), so I’m not using some janky wiring.

I still have the gas tank behind the seat, but it is a brand new one.  The fuel pump is mounted below it, and maybe a foot or so away.

So the fuel pump ran fine.  I was able to set up my carbs and change out jets.  I had gone on a few drives.  After a while there was an inclination that something was up.  There was some stumbling.

Last night I ended up getting stranded.  I had fuel at the inlet and nothing on the other side.  

Today, I checked wiring, I made sure the relay worked and that I had 12v at key on.  Everything seemed fine.  It started right up.  Ran out to get gas, no inclination that something was wrong.  Got home and loaded up for a little trip.  Didn’t get out of the driveway.  The gauge on the pressure regulator says 0.  I can hear the fuel pump running.

1nleovp,Possibly over filled compressor with PAG oil. Condenser need replacing?,"I have a 2007 Saturn Ion-2 2.2 I replaced the compressor, condenser, expansion valve and a line on. When I tried to recharge with r134 refrigerant, it only blew cold for like 15 minutes. Then went back to warm. 

Shortly after, I discovered my high side service port Schrader valve, which is the GM style ball core valve, is damaged and leaking. I think this damage happened very recently because I remember what it looked like at first. The rubber part seems to have a hole or tear in it.

On the other hand, I got conflicting info on how much oil came prefilled in the compressor. The compressor shows it's prefilled with a little more than how much my car calls for, which is about 5oz. The AI Q&A section on Amazon says 100ml. But when I poured out what was in the compressor to measure to be safe, less than an ounce came out, even with turning the clutch while tilting and spinning the compressor in every position. 

I'm planning on getting a replacement compressor to be safe. Will also reach out to the manufacturer and confirm the prefilled amount to be certain. The instructions weren't clear. Manufacturer says their compressor have sufficient oil already in them and don't need any and that most of the oil is pretty much trapped inside the housing of the compressor. Google and people on the internet say the amount claimed by manufacturers is often incorrect. Who's correct here???

Anyway, I was wondering if I should replace the condenser again? The condenser for my specific car happens to have the drier affixed to the condenser, as in not separate parts. Will I be good in keeping the new condenser? Or replace it again? 

I first plan to replace the Schrader valve, pull vacuum again and then try and recharge. 

Thanks",1,1758314059.0,3,MechanicAdvice,1758396686,2025-09-19 20:34:19,2025-09-20 19:31:26,"PublicIndependent858 (Score: 1): Yes, prefilled amounts stated can often be incorrect. And yes, sometimes it's hard to actually drain it all out for a good measurement, but a small bit of error isn't catastrophic. Some compressors actually have a separate ""drain bolt"" that drains the compressor more easily and thoroughly than just pouring out of the discharge/suction ports. But if they do, I'll try and drain from all 3 into a glass measuring cup.

But I think you're making a big assumption that incorrect oil amount is your problem. Too little can lead to early compressor failure (but I'm talking over weeks and months), and too much can lead to ""reduced"" cooling ability but would not cause a sudden loss of cooling like that, where it's good and suddenly not.  Remember the oil is distributed around the system and when you replace an item you're supposed to refill a bit. Usually rule of thumb is about an ounce for a finned cooler like evaporator or condenser, but there should be specs that break it down for how much to pour into a component when replacing each one, along with a ""total system oil amount"".  I had a customer recently who replaced EVERYTHING themselves and didn't add any oil except for assumed 3.5oz in the compressor it was shipped with. So I used an oil injector when recharging to get it back to that ""total system"" requirement.

Sure, leaking service valves are an issue too and definitely worth addressing.

Precise, proper charging is the biggest, most crucial thing I'm wondering if you nailed. The only way to be really sure of what's going on is do what you want with replacing stuff, recharge as precisely to the specified amount as you can (I realize with cans and not an HVAC machine it's more difficult) and then with a gauge-set connected (So you can monitor Low AND high side pressures) watch what happens while monitoring vent temps.

The ratio between the two sides tells you a lot about how various components are working. You want a rannge of 1:4-1:6...of course with 1:5 being ideal. So if you have 40psi on low side, 200psi on the high.  The higher the low-side pressure though, the warmer your evaporator is and warmer your temps will be out of the vents.

PS- no I would not replace the condenser again unless you can see that stuff is contaminated, like the oil coming out, or oil reside on ports you can see is darkened. Did you remember to replace the receiver-drier or desiccant bag (whichever style it has, the thing that sucks out excess moisture the vacuum didn't get)? There's a reason all compressor warranties require that at the same time. If the desiccant bag/sock (long white dealie) is part of the condenser and you have the system open for more than just a few minutes, I WOULD replace that again, as a very last step. Like, if it's the type where you can unscrew a cap off of the tube on the side of the condenser. Do all your work, get prepped and ready and replace that last, ideally as fast as possible to minimize exposure to humidity in the open air. Get a vacuum on it as fast as possible. Vacuum deeply enough and long enough too, of course.  Charge it as precisely as you can and then monitor pressures. If charge is too low or too high, a restriction in the system, or fans aren't going on high speed for example....you can have pressures go too low or too high and disable the compressor (by tripping the low-side or high-side pressure switches)."

Under constant load, it is an ambulance that weighs 11950 lbs. I was able to get it to cool down by stopping and opening hood with cabin heat on full blast while the engine was still running but it still took at least 5 minutes to get back below 220 so in total it was between 220-240 for less than 7-10 minutes, only about a minute while driving. I've had it at 220 plenty of times but this hill was the steepest I've ever drove on and my trans temp gauge shot up quick, although it was a short hill. Should have just kept it under 10 mph. I read these 4L80E should be ok up to 295 F but maybe that doesn't mean the fluid won't need to be changed if you let it get hot. The fluid level is over the HOT line and has been since I added a half a qt after they did the work years ago.

It's a strong smell but I took it to a transmission shop and they smelled the fluid and they said it seems okay.

They have to rotate to move with the suspension as the car moves around.

The direction you're rotating the drag link must allow some movement and the amount of movement seems okay.

Infinite-Condition41 (Score: 20): Not the most perfect advice thus far.

Yes, that rod can have a limited amount of rotation. Normal and doesn't hurt anything.

What you're looking for is end play. Have somebody turn the wheel back and forth while you look. That's how you will find bad tie rod ends. You're looking for end to end play. If something rocks or is loose.

Again, the tie rod being able to rotate a few degrees is not relevant. If you have a knock, you have something loose somewhere and you need to check it by having someone turn the wheel back and forth rapidly. The steering wheel would have excessive play also.

You can replace this yourself, you will need an alignment. I don't tend to mess with these, I just have them switched out and alignment done all at once. If you take the vehicle for an alignment, if they're any good at what they're doing, they'll notice and notify you what needs replaced."

When I took it in to the dealership to diag the other day, the service writer talked me out of it saying in his experience it was going to be carbon deposits on the valves and that neither warranties were going to cover it.

1nl8v8d,Check Headlight Intermittent Notification,"Hyundai Tucson 2019 Value AWD

TL;DR replaced headlight bulbs with LEDs and passenger side keeps intermittently notifying to check it after car has been running for ~10 minutes.

Few months ago I got a notice that my passenger headlight needed to be checked, and it indeed was dead. I ordered a pair of LED headlights to replace it and replaced both sides for good measure. I drove for a day and got the same notification except it was intermittent, with it coming on and off when driving, thought it was an issue with the LEDs I bought so returned them and got new ones (linked below). 

Worked great for about a week but then if driving for more then ~10 minutes the issue came back. I thought maybe it was an issue with these so I put the good halogen bulb from the other side in the passenger side, and the issue remained. 

Thought it was just poor installation by myself so I put the LED back in, making sure it was well seated and for ~month didn't experience any issues (also wasn't driving at night really so never used the lights)

Come now to the last few weeks the issue is back. It's still only the passenger side and regardless of the bulb I put in it it keeps intermittently giving notifications that the headlight needs to be checked, despite the bulbs not dimming, powering off, etc and working 100% as expected.

I did a search for a way to ""reset"" the resistance detection for the bulbs if it's an issue with the LED bulb but the driver side hasn't had any issues with them. I didn't try super hard to look for one but I didn't see any fraying in the wire harness but fear it is that. Thoughts and suggestions?

All the power steering gone through, replaced the gearbox and line. Needs a few more things like door pins and blower motor but already have the parts. Maybe a tune up or just some injector cleaner but honestly a super clean truck. Vortec 350(the good one)s.""

I'm looking at getting this truck. From messaging the seller, I discovered a few more things than what the post mentioned.

* Grandpa truck - exterior and interior's condition reflect this
* Stated that a highway miles (\~50) couldn't feel any issues with shifting when getting up to speed or during
* Misfire on engine - seller is more than willing to complete a compression test on the spot
   * Throttling doesn't make it go away
   * Steady miss even when throttling
      * These two points made me weary of a potential compression issue, but could likely just as well be a single clogged poppet in the spider injector. A steady misfire does lead me to believe it's got to be a single cylinder though.
* Sat for about 3 years

All things considered, it's an old chevy. I'm sure there's some suspension/front end work that could use some love. My main concern is the misfire, but as long as the compression is good I think it should be a relatively simple (But potentially timely) fix. I'll obviously be testing the transmission too, even with the misfire, but I know that's a common pain point on these. I'm hoping since it was a ""Grandpa"" car, that it rarely ever towed anything and that the transmission is fine, or was replaced earlier. I think I'll try to haggle him down to $3000 as I'm not sure if I'll be able to even test A/C since the blower motor is out.

1nl8egp,"Previous owner ran the wrong coolant, actively replacing that.","I am in the process of flushing and replacing the coolant in a used vehicle I purchased. Previous owner had used Dexcool. This is not the correct or even recommended coolant for this car. Ideally I would be running green or blue coolant. 

Currently I am draining the rad, filling it with water which I empty out, filling with distilled water, bleeding the air, running the car to temp with heater cranked, then allowing things to cool before running to temp and eventually draining the rad. I have drained the rad this way 4 times now. I am still seeing orange dye and have approximately 5-10% coolant ratio.

* **P0171 - System Too Lean (Bank 1)**

Since this is my first car and I'm new to all this, I have a few questions:

1. **Prioritization:** What's the most urgent issue to address first? The engine codes or the transmission code?
2. **DIY for a Beginner?** As someone with basically zero repair experience, is there any simple, low-risk troubleshooting I can do myself (like checking for an obvious cracked hose)? Or should I not even think about touching it and go straight to a mechanic?
3. **Common Issues:** Are these known ""weak spots"" for the 2014 Pathfinder? I want to be as informed as possible when I talk to a mechanic.
4. **CVT Judder (P17F1):** For this specific code, is a CVT fluid change a common first step, or does it usually mean bigger trouble is brewing?

Common culprits for air leaks are intake parts not being properly installed, cracked or otherwise damaged.

Other parts could be a leaking tank breather valve, (it connects the gas tank to the intake to equalize pressure between the two so the tank doesn’t expand or implode)

I have also seen issues where an injector or spark plug would leak, you can test that by spraying brake clean on the injectors or plugs and listening to the engine, if there is a leak, it sucks in brake cleaner which increases noise as the engines has more fuel BUT - normally this comes with a squeaky noise or a pretty clearly audible hiss sucking the air in through a tiny Hole"

1nl46xl,Negative terminal always burns in 12V cooling pump 4-pin connector,"I work as a service engineer for an electric car company. I don't have that much experience (have only been accumulating 3 years of experience so far) but I'm trying to figure out the following case:

The cooling pump of the vehicle (used to control high voltage components temperatures) is fed DC 12V and is controled by CAN (so 4 terminals in total ; positive negative CANH CANL). Seven of my customers have been facing the same issue with that pump, the negative terminal on the 4-pin connector burns. I have  one pump and one harness on their way back to me for investigation so I do not have much more information to share at the moment. Additionnally, the customers are not mechanics, technicians or engineers so the amount of information I can get from them is very limited, I do not know much more than what I have explained above (for now). I only know that it is the only terminal that displays the issue, the positive is fine. When the terminal is burned, the pump sometimes works sometimes does not.

Again I do not have much experience and have not faced this type of scenario in the past. My reasoning is that burning happens because of excessive heat. In the context of electricity this would happen because of an excessive current. Again, this could be cause by various reasons such a bad contact, damaged teminals, loose terminals, maybe a damaged wire somewhere along the harness. Maybe something else is causing an excessive increase in resistance thus heat, or voltage drop thus excessive current to compensate power and so on. I'm planning on checking all of the above once I receive the pump and harness, but I still find it odd that only the negative terminal would bear damage.

The problem is to find detailed wiring schematics for that cooling pump circuit, meaning both the diagram itself and the wiring routing. I have no clue what this car but if it's Chinese or Indian literature is difficult to come by and sometimes it's such poor quality as to be worse than useless. 

The alternative is basically to spend a lot of time to check the ground straps first and then move on to the connectors... personally I suspect a connector to be the issue but many EV are so shoddily built it wouldn't surprise me the cooling pumps develop an internal short due to a design/manufacturing defect. Can you check if there's a redesigned pump available from that manufacturer? It would explain a lot of things."

I have a few guesses, from more to least likely, but I'd like some opinions before i start disassembling parts.

From most to least likely in my opinion 
1- one or more valve seals went bad suddenly, and the oil seeps into the cylinders when it's parked 
2- so issue (buit up pressure?) in the PCV system is pushing oil into the intake manifold when the engine stops
3- bad/aligned piston rings (least likely, because what are the odds this happens every time i let the car sit overnight, and then fixes itself after starting.

Of course this would mean it would have mechanical problems in the recent future with it.

vastly101 (Score: 1): For you, I highly recommend a low mileage CPO on a car with high depreciation with an option to extended the warranty to 10 or 11 year/100k manufacturer-company warranty if you are risk-averse.   Get a Lincoln nautilus for 23000 CPO. At 4.5 % for 4 year currently available with 3000 you are talking 480 a month.  5 years closer to 400 unless the rate bumps.   If you cannot afford this, you likely cannot afford a new lease either, as they have high down payments as well.  Good luck getting a $299 lease. you'll be putting down a serious downpayment, aquisition fee, etc.

In that case look for older used cars, at higher risk

I shipped mine from FL to NY.   It happens to that cheapest CPO on [cars.com](http://cars.com) is from the dealrer I bought add: Jarrett Gordon, although 60k miles... The CPO is 6 years/100k from new (late 2027):

FWIW, my salesperson there was Jack Slater, and he was great.   No muss no fuss, very very helpful.  Bought the car remotely with videos he sent and shipped it to NY on my dime.

Ford Edge CPO, too.   The CPO gives a warranty and allows you to extend.   But Ford actuallyhas longer powertrain warranty on the CPO than Licoln, 7 years/100k.  (GOLD CERTIFIED: Blue certified  is just a 6 month warranty, not extendable, not  real certified car IMO!)

In the end, buying is likely much cheaper.   The car will last mire than 4 years with regular oil changes, and coolant/trans is not due soon.   CPO means newer brakes. tires as well.  My tires were brand new.

I bought a Cadillac XTS 2016 in 2017 with 2.5 year warranty left. You can do that too. It has been perfect to 110k mile nreatly 9 years later.  CPO just adds 2 years and instead of 50k warrants up to 100k...

One totally different idea: I havce seen crazy low leases on Honda Prologue, an EV made my GM for Honda.  I think I've seen $99/month with several thousand down over 36 months?  That might e worth checking out if willing to have an EV.  They are heavily subsidized leases for now, I guess.  But watch out withy Trump's rollback of ev credits coming soon."

Otherwise if you're planning on getting a loan you'll need to go to some sort of financial institution. They would also be able to help you with all the paperwork. Most likely the payment would go directly to the other lender. From there the other lender would refund the difference to the seller.

You can adjust the grains of salt accordingly.

Being that this is a wagon door I'm expecting there's some sort of handle on the inside that is relatively well secured to door frame. If so, just rope or ratchet strap this to another secure point inside the cabin. I've been a pallbearer a couple times in my life and from what I recall there are movable posts in the floor to properly secure a casket, one of these would work well. If not, a head rest, seat back, door handle for one of the other doors would be fine. Just don't hit the gas too hard and you really don't need that much. 

As far as the repair, most aftermarket upfitters or customizers that would make such a vehicle tend to not create their own parts. I fully expect the latch and post is a factory part commonly found on a rear door but just repurposed. You can try to take the latch out by yourself and find a part number stamp, or leave this up to the garage you take it to.

Do reply with the eventually fix though, I'm a bit morbidly curious 😉

IAmSpitfireJoe (Score: 1): Ahh, yes. The famous S&S rear door rust. They ALL do this. Finding a replacement would be nearly impossible. While that is pretty extensive, it is repairable. Wild guess $1000 to $1500 if they take pity on you. You might find someone who will do an incomplete job just to make it ""presentable"", and that could be a lot cheaper.

To do this ""right"", the door needs to come off the car. The vinyl roof material, the chrome trim around the rear glass, the rear glass itself, and the door handle would all need to come off. The technician would then be able to determine how bad the rust is. I'm going to guess there are actual holes through the metal, which would mean the bad metal would have to be cut out and new pieces welded back in. Then everything would have to be ground down, the whole door sanded down, body filler used to smooth rough areas, more sanding, primer, and paint. Then everything has to be put back on. New vinyl roof material would be needed, and an automotive upholstery shop would need to cut, sew, and fit the material. Put new padding on the top of the door then install the vinyl. That could be $500 more.

Honest truth? The car isn't worth doing that much work. And then add the exhaust work needed, the door lock problems, the AC issue, and everything else - you're looking at a money pit. But remember, I'm looking at it from a different point of view. I'd be trying to fix it up for resale. You aren't.

My advice would be to take it to an independent body shop (not one of the big chains) and ask what they would do and charge just to make it usable and not an eyesore. Maybe $500 - $700? Another wild guess, but doesn't hurt to ask.

Do the same with the exhaust and AC. Small shop, ask for minimum repairs to make it work and be safe."
1nkpnxx,2018 VW Golf MK7.5 - Installing a dashcam properly...,"After looking through many videos on how to do this, the main thing that I need to do is not run the dashcam wire in front of the airbag when hiding the cable in the A-pillar.

Thankfully I was able to pull over, pressing the clutch in didn’t do anything but I pulled it back up, it kinda fell again, but after pulling it up a second time it stayed. After that I pumped it a few times and it seems to be working normally again.

I drove it home and have driven it around the block a few times since then just to see if anything happens. I do not notice any leaks under the car, I took out the air box and noticed that there is some liquid down near the master cylinder, maybe not brake fluid though?

The level in my brake fluid reservoir seems normal but fluid is maybe a little murky.

Has anybody had this happen where the clutch falls then works normally afterwards? Do I need to replace the master or slave cylinder or maybe just change the fluid? Any tips on identifying an issue?",2,1758251621.0,7,autorepair,1758396686,2025-09-19 03:13:41,2025-09-20 19:31:26,"Big-Accountant-2376 (Score: 2): I'm leaning towards CMC.

1nks5ze,2020 Kia Telluride Ambient Temperature Issues,"A few weeks back, I got an icy road warning, and noticed my outside temperature was reading well below 0 on an 80F day. This was just momentary, them the reading went back to normal. A few days later, the reading permanently plumetted. When I start the car it usually under 0, and the highest it will read is 20F. Error code P0070. I replaced the temperature sensor in the front bumper twice with no results. Borrowed a multimeter from work, checked the sensors and all three (so including the original) were working. Checked all fuses, none are blown. Threw in the towel, thinking it could be the wiring. Suggested my mom take the car to our mechanic. Unfortunately, he has a thing against Kia’s, and really didn’t check much. He plugged in his cheap code reader, got the same P0070 code. Plugged in his “expensive” code reader, and got no codes. Said “must be the computer” and told us to clear the code and sell the car. We’re not in the position to do that. Obviously, not knowing the outside temperature isn’t a problem, but since that temperature influences cooling/heating, the car has no A/C in 90+ degree weather.

Whichever you’re missing, search for the failure. 

Based on saying it’s your mom’s I’m going to assume it is a relative low usage vehicle which makes it more prone to rodent damage. If I were you I’d try to follow the wiring harness from the sensor until it goes into the dash and see if you find evidence of mice. Probably a broken/chewed wire."

I'd have to look that particular unit up, but I think you're right on the overflow idea.

Check your condensate line and make sure it's clear all the way down to the end outside the cabin. The only other thing that could leak under there would be your heating coil, but you would have a sweet smell in your vents. I think you  have a clog, water isn't draining and it gets gross and mildewy. If you have access to an air pump, try to find where it connects near the evaporator (coil in that box) and blow it outward. If you can't access it, you could blow from the outside, but if there's something in the hose you would blow it back into the condensate pan and possibly plug it again."

I've recently fired her up after performing this job she sounded good at first, had a nice idle then i gave some revs, and stalls out on me. but second time she starts up a little rough, picks up in idle around 1000-900 rpms, drops to around to around 800-700rpms and she stalls out again. I went into my diablo tuner and increased the idle by 100 rpms in P/N to remedy it.. nope no go. I'm not sure If the engine is not in timing. The Crank shaft notch 6 oclock, dowel pin 12 o'clock, sprocket 12 o'clock, cylinder 1 at TDC from when I first started her up, I could be off by a few teeth though.

I'm Not sure if I have to put her back in timing after stall out??

I possibly thought it could have been some old fuel. I swapped it out with some fresh 91 octane. Then I took the fuel rail off and cleaned the fuel injectors... nope better start up, but still stalls. 

Popped open valve covers to see if pushrods were seated, but they're good.

Could it be some kind of lost in compression? Or bad plugs? Or check my timing again?? I could still try and swapped the spark plugs, ignition coils in cylinder 8 and see it that helps. But I'm heavily leaning towards its bad timing what do you guys think?

1nlfy9z,"Car went to mechanic and has come home more broken, HELP!","About 2 months ago our car (VW Tiguan 2015) started smoking white smoke from the back. I took this to the mechanic who ran some tests and said it was just oil in the exhaust, and to run it down the motorway and it would be fine. We did so and the issue still persisted. 

A few weeks after this, our stop start would trigger our car to cut out, and of course, white smoke was still coming out the exhaust, so we took it back and we were told it was the throttle pedal. So we ordered the parts and had this replaced. 

The white smoke wasn’t as bad, and we continued to drive as normal. 4 weeks ago, the car started smoking quite a lot of white smoke from the exhaust so we stopped driving and the mechanic came and took it away a few days later. He told us that the turbo charger had failed and needed replacing. Now over the course of 3 weeks, issue after issue would pop up. And we would be told every 2-3 days that we’ll have our car back, but when it was due back another issue would pop up and at this point he became uncontactable. During this time we would constantly have to chase for answers on the car’s progress and we suspect he was avoiding our calls. Our DPF filter was replaced, our EGR was replaced, the intercooler was replaced, along with pipework as it was all clogged with carbon. We admit that we left it too long for the oil change and a service (an expensive lesson we are now learning), so we were conscious to be patient and reasonable garage as we understand it was our own doing. A couple of days ago we were due to get the car back, but yet another issue popped up with the inlet manifold and a new part was ordered and fitted. This morning I was ready to collect the car and was told they would need some more time as a fuel injector seal had failed and would need putting in. We agreed to this and I was allowed to collect the car this morning. When I arrived at the garage the car was running already and all seemed well. I took the car (without turning it off) and once I began driving, I noticed the parking sensors weren’t working, and the radio signal kept dipping out (this could just be a coincidence though). I thought it was maybe just teething issues and didn’t think much of it, I was just happy to have the car back. 

About 15 minutes into the drive home, my power-steering momentarily failed when turning a corner. When I got home (about another 10 minutes later) and turned the car off, the power completely cut out, usually the radio would stay on, etc. All the electrics completely cut off. When trying to restart the car, absolutely nothing, the car wouldn’t even turn over. To note, there were no battery warning lights showing on the dash at any point during the drive home. I spoke to the mechanic who suggested, that because the battery had been out for some time, a cell might be dead in the battery. So, I called my breakdown company who fitted our last battery approx. 18 months ago, to have a look. They ran all the tests and said that they suspect a potential issue with the alternator, with the vehicle battery charging at 12.28v. There were no diagnostic issues showing for the battery, and the battery health seemed fine. To fit a new alternator they quoted us £450. We have already paid close to £2000 for the issues over the last few weeks so this is disheartening to say the least. 

I spoke to the mechanic we had been using and he said he would be coming out today but he failed to show up and is now not communicating with us. I am torn between blowing up the mechanic’s phone and getting them to come out and fix the issue in the hopes that this is just a wiring issue. Or cutting our losses and potentially forking out another £450. 

What could now be causing these new issues of electrical failure? I don’t feel like this is just coincidence and suspect the mechanic may be at fault, but I have no clue about cars. I need to make an informed decision on this, and would like to have some knowledge behind me before having my next conversation with the mechanic as I don’t want him to try and pull the wool over my eyes.

Emission related components are pretty much everything that fails constantly and can include anything. Everything under the hood could be qualified as an Emission related component. 

People have bought into this idea that warranties save money so now there are warranties for fucking everything. Anytime I buy something thats not food, someone is offering to cover it at an additional cost. Since people buy these, it has become a big revenue generator. So of course auto manufacturers offer their own now. Why would they let such a cash cow slip through their fingers? 


At the end of the day, its your money. If you find value in these warranties that everyone offers and practically forces down throat, or it makes you sleep better, then go for it.

Shortly after, I discovered my high side service port Schrader valve, which is the GM style ball core valve, is damaged and leaking. I think this damage happened very recently because I remember what it looked like at first. The rubber part seems to have a hole or tear in it.

On the other hand, I got conflicting info on how much oil came prefilled in the compressor. The compressor shows it's prefilled with a little more than how much my car calls for, which is about 5oz. The AI Q&A section on Amazon says 100ml. But when I poured out what was in the compressor to measure to be safe, less than an ounce came out, even with turning the clutch while tilting and spinning the compressor in every position. 

I'm planning on getting a replacement compressor to be safe. Will also reach out to the manufacturer and confirm the prefilled amount to be certain. The instructions weren't clear. Manufacturer says their compressor have sufficient oil already in them and don't need any and that most of the oil is pretty much trapped inside the housing of the compressor. Google and people on the internet say the amount claimed by manufacturers is often incorrect. Who's correct here???

Anyway, I was wondering if I should replace the condenser again? The condenser for my specific car happens to have the drier affixed to the condenser, as in not separate parts. Will I be good in keeping the new condenser? Or replace it again? 

I first plan to replace the Schrader valve, pull vacuum again and then try and recharge.

Balance new compressors bc oil is mixed with Freon and is all over the system, it doesn’t stay in the compressor.  Drain the old one, measure.  Drain new one and fill with same amount that came out of old one.   Then add like 1 ounce per component removed and replaced like a condenser, AC line.   It takes a lot of extra oil to screw it up."

1nldeth,M177 Engine blew up – now I’m stuck between sleeving the block or buying a new engine,"So my car (Mercedes-AMG C63 with the M177 engine) unfortunately broke down in a big way. The engine had cylinder wall damage, and now it’s at a machine shop.

They’ve told me I’ve got two paths:
	•	Sleeve the block (rebore, sleeve it back to factory spec, fit new pistons, and rebuild everything).
	•	Buy a replacement engine (either brand new or used, which obviously has its own risks).

Right now, I’m leaning toward the sleeve/rebuild option since I’m already in deep with the machine shop, but part of me wonders if going with a new long block or even a used engine would be safer long-term.

Has anyone here gone through this with an AMG (or any performance car)? Would you trust a sleeved and rebuilt block if it’s done by a reputable shop, or would you rather bite the bullet and source a whole engine?

Any perspective or experiences would be appreciated — I just don’t want to end up spending a ton only to run into another failure down the road.

P.S. I’ve been cautioned by several tuning shops and mechanics that rebuilding the M177 with honing/sleeving often leads to failure, as they claim this engine doesn’t tolerate sleeves well compared to the M157. At the same time, I get the impression some of them may just be steering me toward buying a replacement block or core instead of attempting the more involved rebuild. Since I don’t have firsthand experience, I’m raising this for advice to make sure I understand the risks and best path forward.",1,1758311025.0,3,AskMechanics,1758396686,2025-09-19 19:43:45,2025-09-20 19:31:26,"MOZ5ET (Score: 2): It all depends on how much you can get a used engine/new engine for and how much the machine shop is charging to rebuild.

My car has a bunch of issues and I'm broke. I need to replace my tires, CV axles, rear brakes, and oil cooler gaskets. Recently I've noticed my car takes a long time to get to running temperature and generally stays below running so I'm pretty sure it is the thermostat. Running temp is 195-210°F, it will get to 195 if I let it sit for 5-10min but usually drops down to 160-170 while driving unless I'm going up a mountain to work, then it gets to 200.

I'm trying to figure out what is the highest priority so I can figure out where to spend my money and time.

I'm thinking the tires, brakes, and axles should be the higher priority than the thermostat since if they fail I could crash and my work commute involves mountain roads, so a loss of control could mean literally flying off a cliff.

The oil cooler is slowly leaking. It needs new gaskets but would be the most complex DIY thing I've done so the cost is higher than the gaskets themselves when you account for hours missed from work, especially if anything goes wrong.

Me, knowing nothing about cars, tried to start the car more than once, when that failed. I got it pushed out of the way, jumped, and tried to start it again. After that, I waited 12+ hours, got back to the car, and tried to jump & start it again. The car refused to turn over. 

I had the car towed to a mechanic for repair, they swapped the battery, air filter, oil, & Sparkplugs. and while the car sounds better, it still wont turn over. 

I got an OEM reader and found the following codes, P0123, P0222, P2122, & P2127.

2.  Why would the mechanic not be able to tell you if the motor is locked up or not, nor give you information about the codes, and course of action?

3.  You mentioned the car sounds better after the mechanic did work, how? (no struggling sound?)

Furthermore, without the actual sound of the car trying to start, don't bet the money on engine replacement....just yet



Now to answer your question

1.  If your motor is hydrolocked, then yes, replacing motor is best course of action, all things considered

2.  If your engine is replaced, it could be, if water did not get anywhere else and may have caused secondary issue, especially with the ECM hanging in the engine bay when it got flooded.  Mechanic will have to fill you in on that

3.  Those codes are all related to your computerized intake throttle body. It's pointing to a short within the throttle body.  

4.  Don't drive full speed through puddle.  If engine shuts off after you hit water, do not try to the restart it right away.  Have the car towed.  If you know what you're doing, let the car sit for several hours, then dry out any wet electrical components under the hood.  After that, take out all spark plugs, and crank the car, that will allow for the piston to push any ingested water out while lowering change of bent rod or worse.

1nl0ime,Should we try & escalate this with Hyundai?,"We have a ‘22 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid Limited (the one with a solar panel on the roof), and sadly it ran into a bit of a snag a couple of weeks ago. One fine morning, the battery was completely drained (or so it appeared). Since the car is still under warranty, we requested roadside assistance from Hyundai, which promptly came in & jumpstarted the car. However, because we distinctly remembered that no cabin light or anything of the like was left on, we took the car into a nearby Hyundai service center for diagnostics.

After a day or so, the service representative informed us that they have ruled out the 9V battery, and the main Hybrid battery as the cause, and they now suspect an issue with the circuitry of the solar panel. TBH, we’re not fully sure how the three actually interact under the hood, but nonetheless the service representative also told us that this being a limited edition, availability of technicians who know about the solar panel is somewhat scarce, so it could be a while before they get hold of one (we assume this means they didn’t have one on their regular staff). It’s been three weeks since then, and every time we called their office, they have had the same answer for us - they haven’t been able to locate a technician yet.

The objective behind this post is to figure out what are our options at this point:

1.	⁠Do we just continue waiting?


2.	⁠Would it make sense to enquire with other Hyundai service centers nearby to see if they can locate a tech. Our reluctance with this route stems from the likelihood that we may not be able to describe the issue in great detail to another service center (based on the info we got from the current one), and that could translate into the new service center not being able to give us an accurate estimate without physically examining the car, and ultimately we could run into the same issue, just at a different location.


3.	⁠Is there an avenue for consumers to reach out to the manufacturer directly in such cases? We’re not too hopeful, but perhaps Hyundai could help us locate a qualified technician who knows their way around the solar panels. If anyone has gone this route before, could they please advise on how do we go about it?

FWIW, we’re located in the Greater Boston area (US), so area specific advice will be immensely appreciated, but general advice will also be very valuable.

First off, There is a slight vibration (not really vibration but more pulsing of how much brake force seems to be applied under constant application of the brake pedal) under normal circumstances, not enough for it to be an issue but it's definitely noticable compared to my Mazda3 or my dad's Camaro both of which haven't shown this in their lifespans. 

Second, this seems to become more prominent as the brakes heat up. I say heat up as there have been instances where I've had to slow down from highway speeds to a standstill and have noticed that this brake vibration/pulsing gets significantly worse and then better as the brakes cool down again. It is important to mention that this was the car that I spent my late teenage years in so it has been pushed to it's limits on back roads (as dumb teenagers do) which is why I'm assuming I may have messed up the brakes at some point then.

1nkt7mg,2005 Ford Focus wagon (auto) transmission slipping — worth diagnosing or write-off?,"
I’ve got a 2005 2.0L FWD Ford Focus wagon with 261k km that was given to me, with a pretty decent service history. I’m using it to commute ~40 minutes each way up and down a mountain road in Canada.

When I first got it, I noticed the transmission slipping a bit — e.g. cruising uphill at 80–90 km/h, I’d give it some gas and the revs would rise but the car would lose speed. I checked the ATF and it was dark and smelled burnt.

I did a fluid change (drain and fill, not a flush) and put in new fluid, which really helped. Fluid level looks good now and doesn’t smell burnt. When I drained it, there was maybe a tablespoon of metal sludge stuck to the magnet.

Since then it’s been mostly running okay, though I had a code for the MAF and one for the fuel pressure sensor. Cleaned the MAF and that code cleared. Haven’t done the fuel pressure sensor yet, not sure if it’s related.

Yesterday, after a spirited downhill drive, the transmission started slipping again at highway speeds when it was hot. In town afterwards it struggled to accelerate — 1st and 2nd seemed okay, but when it shifted into 3rd it would just rev out and lose speed. Backing off the throttle didn’t help. I crawled it up to ~70 km/h and it was okay again. Left it overnight and today it feels fine when accelerating.

Other thing I’ve noticed: sometimes it’s late to change gears or the shifts feel a bit harsh.

I won’t be driving it back up the mountain until I know what’s going on.

So my questions:

What can I do myself to further diagnose how bad this is?

Is this likely a solenoid/valve body issue that could be fixed cheaply, or does it sound like internal clutch wear (aka game over)?

If it needs a transmission, I’ll scrap it, so I don’t want to spend money at a mechanic just to be told that.

Any advice appreciated.

TL;DR: 2005 Focus wagon auto, 261k km. Burnt fluid changed, helped for a bit, but now slipping again when hot (especially in 3rd). Sometimes late/harsh shifts.

Then you will need to figure out how much automatic transmission fluid you drained out so you can top it back off again. A lot of cars now don't have level checkers unfortunately. However sometimes if they do but no dipstick there is a way you can use the oil dipstick to check the level but this is also not accurate. It's hard to determine how much transmission oil you drained because 1. There's still plenty in your transmission and your torque converter and 2. You don't want to overfill it. 

If this is way out of your ability I would highly recommend you take it to a shop and explain that you drained your transmission oil by accident and you'll need it refilled. It shouldn't cost too much, you're just glad that you didn't run your car for a long time to damage your engine. Or run your automatic transmission a long time either because they can heat up and it could damage it. 

Honestly I think you're in the clear, although you may have wasted 5 litres of oil just be glad you don't need a new transmission or engine. Tow it into a shop and get a refill on your transmission.

1nksgg4,How the hell did my transmission fix itself?,"So a few weeks ago my 2002 XTerra started leaking transmission fluid, and being the idiot that I am I didn't make a big deal out of it as I thought it was just an oil leak. Anyway after about a week of driving around like that my reverse gear stopped working and neutral started acting weird, as in I could put the car into neutral and it would roll freely downhill, but if you touched the gas it would start moving forward.

Anyway I got the transmission fluid issue fixed (it was a disconnected hose in front of the engine), filled it with fluid and drove it for the past few weeks without a single issue from the FORWARD gears, I just didn't have reverse/neutral.

And yes it made for some EXTREMELY stressful driving situations where I could have shoved a lump of coal up my ass and made a diamond, but all the forward gears worked without issue, no grinding, no late shifting, no rough shifting, nothing.

Fast forward a few weeks of me driving to and from work and wondering how the hell I was going to pay for my transmission to get fixed when 'lo and behold I got a coolant leak in the hose leading from the firewall to the engine, spraying two full refills of coolant all over the place and steaming the living shit out of everything.

Got that fixed and kept driving for a couple of days, freaking out at even the thought of having to drive in reverse & obsessively looking at my engine temperature gauge whenever I was on the highway, until...

This is where shit gets weird.

The other morning as I was coming home from work I parked kind of shitty (I was parking on the street because I couldn't use my driveway) and was expecting to have to go aaaaall the way around the block to try again when I thought ""What the hell"" and put it in reverse.

And it worked.

So did neutral.

No grinding, no ""thunking"" just a fully functional reverse and neutral gear as though there was never a problem in the first place.

I'm (CLEARLY) not a mechanic but I have a theory; In another group someone said that losing a reverse gear when all the other gears work is most likely a dirty sensor, so is it possible that the coolant leak and all that steam under the hood somehow cleaned the reverse sensor and inadvertently fixed my transmission?

tomhalejr (Score: 4): Dodge/Chrysler has done it going back to OBDI systems, but most vehicles are module controlled nowadays. We carry external regulators for Dodge alts in particular that add onto B+ and stator, to cheat the PCM signal for the regulatorest signal. You have to open the alt and solder to the stator, so it's not bolt on. We have even done some adjustable regs for folks with a lithium bank for their boom boom stereos.


Even if there is an internal regulator, the activation could still be module controlled. GM has been doing that since the middle 00's (?). Ford 6G uses module sense for the S wire. Honda since the mid 80's, especially the Civics, have used a com terminal for their load response. 


For emissions and café standard, load response alternator systems are more rhe norm nowadays, with the field sense going through the modules, as opposed to the older B+ sense style going back to generators, and the first gen alternators. So on the bench, you may be able to full field an alt to see if it works, but you can't regulate it without whatever is being used for a data line signal."

For the last 3 days there has been a metallic rattling noise coming from the front driver-side wheelwell. It starts around 27 MPH and gets louder and faster as I accelerate. Occasionally it won’t kick in until about 40, and today it began at 20 after I went over a bump. It goes away after about half a second of braking, just tapping them doesn’t do anything but it goes away when I hold them. The noise stays when I am maintaining speed and coasting to a stop as well. 

Just a little while ago on my way home a new issue showed up. I was in the middle of a turn and the ABS, Traction control and tire pressure system warnings all came on in unison. They were on for about a minute, and during that time the breaks seemed to not be working properly, the car took significantly longer to slow than it usually does. 

Shortly before that, after I got off the highway and began to accelerate again the speedometer went haywire. I was consistently accelerating but the needle started to move quickly down then back up and then down again, kind of like when you drop something heavy on a scale.

I've been into london 4 times so am expecting 3 more charges to come through, which will add up to more than i can afford to lose at the moment.

The car mostly drives like a dream (well, it drives like a turbocharged barge but a very comfy one), but has also had a variety of electrical gremlims show themselves that were of course glossed over in the ad. 

I messaged the dealer to ask to reverse the sale and he said ""We had removed the ULEZ compliance well before sale as we noticed we had made an admin error."" This, is untrue - the ad was, for some reason, still up as of today and i screenshotted it with it's ""ulez"" claim before i messaged him. he has since edited this.

I'm genuinely gutted as it's a beautiful car and one that I've always wanted.

What should i do? Should i be entitled to a refund given that the ad was misleading? ://

MOT in March only had a brake pipe advisory, have also had water pump and timing belt changed in July by the same mechanic who checked over the car for me.

Does anyone have any further advice for what I can do to prove my innocence? I need to wait until my insurer replies (presumably on Monday now), I’m wanting to act quickly to ensure I have a good defence.

I assume the claimant has some CCTV footage of the collision, this is a busy road very close to where I work. I assume they must have footage of my car driving past a car parked on the side of the road and have incorrectly claimed I hit their car.

1nlekwo,Pre-delivery repair not disclosed by the dealer,"Hi everyone,

I was wondering if I could get some advice on a situation with a car I'm trying to get rid of.

I got a brand new Ford Focus in 2023. At the time, it was sold as brand new. 

About a year in, I spotted a bit of lacquer peel by the drivers side wheel arch but didn't think too much of it as it was such a small area. Instead I resolved to keep an eye on it.

I'm now in the process of getting rid of the car and noticed upon closer inspection, some overspray on the plastic trim. I then remembered that I actually emailed the dealer a week after taking delivery of the car to question the poor trim fitment on the drivers side. I received a phone call explaining it was nothing to worry about, which obviously I should have challenged more at the time. Funny he didn't want to leave an email trial right?

Anyway, fast forward to today and I took it into my local body shop. The guy pointed out straight away that the car had been repaired on that side and you could see the filler sinking. The fact it had filler to me suggests it wasn't just a scratch and that it had a fairly significant repair before being handed to me.

The body shop guy, while sympathetic, said this is unfortunately common on new cars. He said the problem I'm likely to face is if I take this to the dealer, they'll argue that it's nothing to do with them as 2 years have passed. Ironically I've actually had to get the other side of the car repaired (properly), so I'm worried if I bring it up, they'll somehow try and use that against me.

The bodyshop offered to do a flat and buff, which they think will be more than adequate to get it past an inspector and loaded onto a car at auction for some other lucky soul to own. But something doesn't sit right with me that this can just happen.

Has anyone had a similar experience or any advice on how to proceed? I'm picking up our new car next week and ideally want the Focus gone in the next month. I'm reluctant to just knock £250 from the car's value if this is flagged by a buying dealer.

1) Pandora Immobilisers. Even if they did somehow take the car then it would automatically shut down within a few minutes. You can also disable the car from starting or shut it down remotely whenever you like. Pandora LED in the window to let thieves know.

2) Cameras with floodlights covering every angle of your property. Thieves hate light so get as many as possible and place the cameras in a way that it wont be possible to sabotage one without getting caught on another.

Setup blink cameras viewing your front and back door that alerts you via echo devices whenever it detects motion.

2018 (**10,578**) 2019 (**20,441**) 2020 (**25,505**) 2021 (**31,751**) 2022 (**40,054**) 2023 (**No service**) 2024 (**74,213**) 2025 (**Not yet serviced but sat at 97,700**)

That means that from Dec 2022 to Dec 2024, there was no service and 34,000 miles driven, and again this year with an additional 23,000 driven with no service until the car is sold. Also no previous records pre-2018. The oil was a dark red colour, nearly like a good bottle of merlot.

1nla3c0,Fake service history,"Hey guys! 

Looking for help/advice.

I purchased a car on finance in June 2024 was told it had a full service history at a quick glance looked fine. Had a few issues with the vehicle rattling near the engine and logged this with the garage in the beginning said they couldn’t locate the fault. The oil leaked and had to top up after 3000 miles they advised this was normal. I don’t have proof of those conversations now as I have a new phone but may have logged a few issues with the AA so hopefully get the reports from them.

My car is currently in another dealership for timing chain/clutch replacement and we need a new engine. So nearly a 5k job. I owe 5k on the car still and the car isn’t worth 2k.

Upon looking at the service history the stamps are all from the dealership I got the car from, 2014 -2024 the vehicle is a 2013 reg. strange they are all that that dealership.

So I looked properly into the mot history - one of the dates the car had an MOT 109 miles away and was apparently serviced the same day with the exact same mileage!
The second one maybe explainable but very questionable was serviced at the dealership I got it from then 2 days later was MOTD by the same garage and had done 900 miles in 2 days. All the mots were done 109 miles away at a couple of garages in the same area. So why would you travel to the same garage every time for a service so far away, wouldn’t you get them done same date and time if your travelling that far.

Has anyone experienced anything similar. 

I’ve contacted finance company and asked for a refund but they have advised I need to prove the issues were there when I got the vehicle and I would need to pay for it to be inspected.  My issue is I was still misold a vehicle weather that caused the issue or not.

I think the upper bit is part of the radiator support so unbolts but the underneath is part of the chassis effectively. I'd be sceptical that it's been repaired well because it's easy to hide. You can bolt the headlights in sufficiently using only the top side so it's possible they bodged the underside and maybe haven't even managed to bolt it in. If you were to see this car give the headlight a damn good inspection and see if you can wiggle it. It should be completely secure.

The bonnet I'd also be concerned about. Check gaps etc. Make sure it doesn't catch. If it's not been pushed back with too much force a new bonnet, hinges and catch (also part of the radiator pack) isn't very taxing to replace.

Rest of it pretty much bolts on. If the wing from the factory is both bolted & riveted (I think they generally are) check they riveted it. If they missed this and just bolted it it can be a sign of a cheap in/out as fast as possible job. The rivets - if it has them - will be top side of the wing and right there when you lift the bonnet."

A Yaris is a sensible choice if you want reliability. However, nothing is guaranteed in life. Nobody can predict what will happen to it between now and 2035, all you can do is look after it as best you can; change the oil and filters at least once a year, keep on top of any small issues so they don't turn into big ones, and clean the car regularly, especially underneath.

> I'm really just not sure at the price point what to look for in regards to the year of the car, or the mileage (what mileage is too high that I should be avoiding, etc.)

You should probably look for something that's more high mileage. 40 miles per week = 2000 miles per year, or 20k miles in ten years, and a well maintained Yaris will happily do 150k miles, so you can safely look at something with 110-120k miles. You'll also find that an average mileage one be older, and rust is what kills most Japanese cars. So finding one that's newer/higher mileage is probably to your benefit in terms of the condition of the bodywork and structure.

£5000 seems to get you a 15-17 plate car with mileage from 60-100k. Just look for it having a full service history (i.e. at least one service for every year of its life), and use [this government website](https://www.check-mot.service.gov.uk) to check the MOT history. Other things to look at are the tyres. Are they a familiar brand? Are they a matching set? This is often a good giveaway of how well it's been looked after. And be prepared to get down on your hands and knees and have a squint under the car.

As a for example, [here's a black 65-plate 1.33L Icon in Peterborough for £4990](https://www.autotrader.co.uk/car-details/202509076131865). 101k miles. The advert claims it has a FSH (though you should always double-check for yourself), the MOT history is [extremely clean](https://www.check-mot.service.gov.uk/results?registration=sy65lwt), and it won't need tested again until August '26. This is what you *can* get for your money, so use that as a reference even if it's too far away for you."

Having had a look at recent reviews, there's quite a few instances of people alleging pressure being applied by CC agents to list cars with no reserve, or selling cars with higher mileage than advertised. They only have 4 Google reviews, all 1 star. Trustpilot seem to either have very positive or very negative (82% 5 star, 13% 1 star).

I realise its an auction site - And all sales are final etc, etc, and you should do your own research, but I just wonder what service they are providing if so many people are having issues
