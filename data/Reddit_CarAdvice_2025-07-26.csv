Some engines can leak coolant into the combustion chambers from an intake manifold leak.  Does it overheat when full, or does the coolant level have to drop some before it overheats?  Maybe you have a leak, but the overheating only happens once you are low on coolant and there is air getting in the system.  In which case, you might be OK once the leak is fixed.

Are the radiator fans working properly?  If you have a fan mounted on a pulley that is spun by the accessory (serpentine) belt, the fan clutch might be shot.  It is hard to tell, the fan will spin if the clutch is bad, but it won't spin ""enough"" to work properly.

So, took it to several shops (including Nissan) and finally got the P0101 code off by having them reset the PCM (a bulletin was out on it that I was never aware of) but the smoke coming from the tailpipe for the snap test is still there.

More details - I went back to Nissan and they told me to use a thicker oil because my car is burning oil, so I did that and still, there is smoke. I then got a tune up (sparks replaced and etc.) and the shop did a quick snap test and there‚Äôs still smoke. To note, I got the tune up done because I never changed them out after reach 105k+ miles.

1m97whr,Please Help! Check engine light keeps coming on after several repairs.,"Hi guys, 
This is a pretty long post but i‚Äôm really frustrated about the situation and just need answers. 
I have a 2017 Subaru Impreza that I bought from a used Subaru dealership back in January 25. Around the beginning of June I was in my car eating lunch when my check engine light came on. I thought it was weird and started googling what it could be. It was driving completely normal at the time. I thought maybe I didn‚Äôt have my gas caps on good enough so I went to fill up my tank and made sure to screw it on good. After that I drove almost 600 miles for a weekend trip. The car acted completely normal the whole trip so I assumed that it was just the gas cap. After I got back from the trip I was sitting in my car eating lunch and my check engine light came on again. I put it in drive and started to ride it around and noticed that when I would accelerate it would hesitate and it would take a while to get up to a good speed. I also noticed that when I was sitting in idle the engine would jolt or shake a little bit. I had my uncle come and look at it and we got Autozone to pull the codes and it gave us a P2011 code. My uncle replaced the air filter and added some fuel additive to see if that would help and I decided to take it to an auto shop that my uncle recommended me to. the majority of the conversations that I had with this shop also went through my uncle because he knows more about this stuff than I do. They ran the codes and it showed the P2011 code. The shop decided that the sensors for the intake manifold were failing and I would have to replace the entire intake manifold be Subaru doesn‚Äôt manufacture the sensors separately. So I approved the job and paid for it, almost $2000. Everyone seemed to agree that after this part was replaced I wouldn‚Äôt have anymore issues. I pick the car up from the shop and it drive normal again. About a week later i‚Äôm driving down the road and the engine light pops back up and it immediately starts to hesitate and loose power again. I drive it back to the shop and they immediately seem confused and say that they‚Äôll check it out. They call my uncle and tell him that there‚Äôs still some electrical issues they didn‚Äôt see the first time and that they‚Äôll need to replace the EMC Board. I told them I wasn‚Äôt going to pay for anything and sense the work they did for the intake manifold was covered under warranty they ordered the part and replaced it for free, they also had to send it to the actual Subaru Dealership to be programmed. After this the shop told me I‚Äôd basically have a brand new car and I shouldn‚Äôt have any more issues. I picked it up and it drove normal again for about 2 weeks. I was sitting in my car again for lunch one day and the check engine light came back on, im fed up at this point and call my uncle. He calls the shop and I bring it back in. They seemed frustrated about it too and the shop ends up re wiring a significant portion of the car for free and they again seemed hopeful that it‚Äôll be the end of the issues. I picked it up from the shop and it drove completely normal for another 2 weeks. That brings me to this past Monday. I was sitting in my car for lunch and the check engine light comes on. I put it in reverse and start driving it straight to the shop. As soon as I start driving it I can immediately tell something was way different. It wasn‚Äôt like the last 3 times. This time along with my check engine light my traction control lights were also on. I turned the car off and tried to crank it back on and it had a pretty long crank. When I would press on the acceleration the car would jolt back and it would struggle to get to 15mph. I could get it going about 40mph but it took it a while because if I would press on the gas too hard it would immediately jolt back. I got it to the shop and they ran the codes and said that it was now pulling a different code so I left my keys with them to do more testing. This is when they started charging me for stuff. They tried to charge me over $300 dollars for 2 different levels of testing and then another $300 to replace the OBD reader in my car because it was ‚Äúfalling apart‚Äù They never said anything about my OBD reader being in bad condition before this but they insisted they could go forward with testing until it was replaced. My uncle got pissed off about it and just told them to clear the codes so I could pick up the car. I go pick up the car and I drive it to the bank because I‚Äôm thinking that i‚Äôll probably just have to trade it in and get something else so but it was driving fine then. On my way home from work that night the lights come back on and it immediately starts to drive pretty badly. I pull over because I wasn‚Äôt comfortable driving that slow on the busy road I was on and call AAA to tow it to the actual Subaru Dealership. I call the dealership and let them know so they will have it scheduled to be looked at. When the tow guy came to pick it up he cranked the car and again had a pretty long crank but it finally started. He got out and immediately said that it was just my fuel pump/filter. He sounded pretty confident about it and I let him know that it had been in and out of the shop for about 2 months. He got it to drive up on the truck and took it to the dealership shop Wednesday night. It‚Äôs mid afternoon friday now and I keep calling the dealership for updates and they say they‚Äôre working on it and will have someone call me with an update soon. I don‚Äôt want to be too overbearing though so I‚Äôm just waiting it out at this point. I‚Äôve just paid for them to do their diagnostic testing on it and figure out what‚Äôs wrong. They haven‚Äôt said anything about my OBD reader so I‚Äôm starting to think the other shop was just bullshitting me. If it‚Äôs something that can be fixed for a reasonable price i‚Äôll do it, I certainly don‚Äôt want a different car it‚Äôs been a really nice car and I like it. But I can‚Äôt keep dealing with the same issues over and over so whatever the dealership tells me will depend on if I trade it in or not. I‚Äôve been looking up about fuel pump failures and the symptoms seem pretty similar to what i‚Äôm dealing with but I just want to see what you guys think it could be.

Fuel pumps can get weaker overtime but I've seen more direct it either works or doesn't type failures. The filter has a chance of being old and needing replaced, but that to me doesn't explain the traction control light. All in all I think best course of action is to have the car replicate the failure while connected to a live data OBD2 scanner with an eye on fuel pressure and temps etc. In my 04 outback it will turn off VDC if it gets hotter than it would like to be, and that's trac control etc.. so I wonder if it's not a cooling issue of some sort and the car attempting to go into limp. Either way best of luck. Fuel filter should be cheap enough but for some reason I'm thinking heat.

Then when you‚Äôre all done you bleed the brakes to get the air out of the line, top off the reservoir and voila.

Everything went well, except for me way over tightening the drain bolt. I have a Haynes manual for the car, and when I looked back at the book after messing up the bolt, I realized the mistake I made. 106 in-lbs is listed as the torque spec for that drain bolt. One line below that, the torque spec for a different bolt is 29 ft-lbs. not knowing any better due to this being my first mechanical experience, I tried to tighten the bolt to 29 ft lbs, stripping it and cracking the drain hole. At least I think those are cracks in the picture. I left it alone, put the underbody shield back on, and for now am going to try to fix with JB weld and a nut insert. If this were a different car, I could just get a new transmission pan. However, the 6f35 has the drain bolt at the bottom of the transmission case. There is no ‚Äúpan‚Äù. So, to truly fix this, it would require pulling the transmission and replacing the entire transmission case. I don‚Äôt want to have to tell my dad I broke the car this badly.

Your fault codes are a typical array of communication errors, not uncommon for any Ford of this year range. 

It could be that either participant of the high speed CAN network is not communicating and therefore the immobiliser does not unlock. Your best bet would be to use an OBD2 scanner again to try and connect with the individual modules, if you cannot access the instrument cluster or the PCM, there is your problem. Alternatively, any participant of the high speed CAN network may be faulty and disturb the signal going to and fro the control units. 

And the simplest reason for a fault like this may just be a dead battery also. If the relevant modules like the PCM don't get enough power or stable ground connection, things won't work. Damage in the CAN bus wiring also can lead to these symptoms.

The radiator fan works differently.  It goes by coolant temperature.  If you vehicle temp reaches a certain threshold, it will activate, regardless of driving speed.  While you are driving, there is air forced through the radiator so a lot of times that fan has no need to come on.

* New master cylinder (ATE)
* All new hard lines (copper-nickel, hand-bent)
* New soft lines (all 4)
* New rear cylinders, shoes, springs ‚Äì everything
* Adjusted the shoes so they‚Äôre snug, drums have drag

**1.** I‚Äôve bled the system three full times (pressure bleeder + pedal help), in the right order (RR &gt; RL &gt; FR &gt; FL). No visible leaks anywhere. Still, the pedal has a soft section before firming up. It doesn‚Äôt go to the floor, but it‚Äôs definitely not as firm as it should be.

2. I plugged all the outlets on the master cylinder to test it, and the pedal felt solid, so I could be sure the MC was all right.

**3.** I plugged the other ports on the master and bled only the front-left circuit (short and easy line). Did gravity bleeding twice until no bubbles. Then fired up the car and pumped the pedal a few times. The pedal is hard-ish, but still has a bit of soft travel at the top. The caliper moves. I‚Äôd expect this line to be rock solid by now.

**Could I still have air in the master o in the rest of the cirucit after 3 attempts? Even in this super short line? Would reverse bleeding help? I‚Äôve tried using a big syringe before and it was a mess ‚Äì thinking about trying a drill pump or a proper fluid transfer pump.**

Anyone else run into weird bleeding issues with drum rears and a T-fitting like this setup. Is it normal for a new master cylinder to take several full purges before the pedal firms up completely?

Assuming it has one, and that you bled correctly:

A faulty brake booster can definitely cause a soft or spongy brake pedal.¬†The brake booster is designed to amplify the force you apply to the brake pedal, making braking easier.¬†A faulty booster will reduce this amplification, leading to a pedal that feels soft because it requires more effort to engage the brakes.

1m91c56,2012 Chevy Traverse Valve cover gasket noise after replacing,"Hello all, just recently bought this car and had a misfire within a week of driving it. Has roughly 155k miles. Checked the spark plugs and they had oil in the tube seals. Decided to go ahead and do the valve cover gaskets, tube seals, spark plugs and ignition coils. I‚Äôll attach a few pictures but not sure they‚Äôll help at all. After getting everything all back together and waiting for the rtv to cure. I started it up and could hear a ticking/rubbing noise coming from the rear valve cover on the timing chain side. Almost like the timing chain was rubbing on cover. I let the engine sit over night and took the engine cover back off and felt all around the valve cover and it doesn‚Äôt seem to be leaking at all. I don‚Äôt hear any whistling or suction sounds when the engine is running. After starting it again this morning it seems like the noise is starting to go away, but I‚Äôm only running the engine for a few seconds. Checked the oil and it was about half full so I topped it off as well as the power steering fluid since most of it drained while needing to move it out of the way. I did have to leave the back valve cover off overnight before putting it back on but had everything covered. I‚Äôm hoping this could be normal and everything just needs more time to run to get lubricated. I did following the tightening sequence but did not use a torque wrench because mine just broke. I know the first recommendation is going to be getting a new torque wrench and loosen an retorque them. Although i don‚Äôt think they are over tightened, I followed the sequence and tightened them each a little at a time until they were snug but not risking over tightening.

1m90xv0,Getting Into The Industry,"Hello everyone,

I recently developed a likeness to vehicles and how they operate in my late 20s. In terms of life &amp; career paths, nothing has worked for me yet &amp; I‚Äôm still stuck in a position I wouldn‚Äôt wish upon my enemies. Assuming 3rd party funding is approved, I should be set to go to school to become a dealership garage mechanic(at least that‚Äôs what the college advertises). Recently, I lost my job, in an unrelated field, and accepted an oil change tech job at one of my local quicklube spots.

I‚Äôve done some work on my own vehicle such as, axles, brakes, vac pump del(Lmk if you can guess what I drive as as result of the work I‚Äôve done!). I get that feeling of knowing that I did that &amp; what‚Äôs the next mod?!?!? I just wish I was faster at it. Moreover, my mental health is crumbling the further I continue to work in fields that require more human interaction. I can‚Äôt get upset with a car part like I can with humans and I‚Äôve been trying to lean into that problem solving facet of it more as I go into it. I have some interesting ideas as well for my future but that‚Äôs really far down the line, tbf

So, in essence, I‚Äôm trying to set myself up to get my foot in the door &amp; make a career out of this. I‚Äôm really interested in getting some takes from seasoned mechanics. Is this the right path with where the industry is at? Should I be looking at other options &amp; if so, where? What are some things you wish you knew before you went into this as a career? What would you do differently if you had the choice? Etc.

1m8rcnh,Looking for advice on how to deal with a shops pricing,"Was looking for some input on my current situation with my car that's at a mechanic shop right now. So i took my turboed car into this mechanic shop to fix a leak on the exhaust manifold along with getting it tuned. Mechanic told me it would be $175/hr to do the tune along with $150/hr for repairs on the car which was fine with me. Took the car in and after being in the shop for a week the mechanic called me say that he put in a spacer ($40) and two gaskets ($20 ea) and fixed the leak on the exhaust, but was calling to inform me that the Parking brake lever had broken and needed to be replaced (worked fine for the 6 years ive owned the car) and quoted me $250 for the assembly along with an hour of labor to put it in. Gave him the OK and ended the call. A week later he called to tell me the pedal position sensor was bad and needed a new one. Quoted 150 for the part along with 1 hour of labor for it. Today, after having the car at the shop for 4 weeks, the mechanic called me to tell me the car was ready for pickup that they had driven it about 60 miles to test all the parts they put in, but that they had to replace the EVAP caninster (which they never called me to get an OK on it) to get the check engine light to clear. Told the mechanic it was fine that id be there tomorrow to pick it up. I asked for a total on the work and the mechanic said it was $6,925.16. Calculated the parts to about 1.1k including the labor rate/mark up and guessed about 1k for the tune which would be about 5 hours of tuning the vehicle at their rate. So $2,100 in parts leaves us with about $4,800 which at their rate would be at around 30 hours to take off the downpipe, intake, 1 intercooler elbow to the turbo tip/ Wastegate, and exhaust manifold to throw in 2 gaskets and 1 spacer  Thoughts on this bullshit?

I can't tell exactly from the video what it is, but in general suspension noises can be found by jacking up the front end of the car and removing the wheels to inspect parts for excessive play. 

Sometimes the culprit is obvious, sometimes it's not and you drive yourself insane over the course of three months while losing sleep over trying to analyze the waveform of the sound at 2am.

If you want to take a look, watch a quick video that describes the suspension components of your car and start pulling on those parts to see what moves or knocks. 

It's usually the stabilizer links, but not always. There's plenty of stuff down there to knock around. The stabilizer bar/sway bar also has a couple bushings along it that can wear out, but you'll probably have to crawl under the car and remove bolts to check those out. Replace parts in pairs, if one side goes out the other probably isn't far behind.

Edit: Kinda sounds like control arms knocking around on a second watch. You can look at the bushings on them and visually see if they are intact or not."

My engine was replaced and covered due to a warranty. I finally get my car back after 3+ weeks. (Im so happy!). We'll it didn't last.

As soon as I get into my car, I turn the AC on, (it typically takes about 5 mins to start to feel COLD if vehilce is in direct sunlight and idelling.) Once I started driving, typically that helps the compressor a lot with the AC from the power and the engine. But i couldn't help noticing an issue with the AC RIGHT AWAY!
I mean, right off the dealerships lot. 
I picked the car up late so the service department was closed so I called the following day.
The first thing the gentleman said to me was, ""How do you know it was due to the replacement of the engine?"" 

Now, I want to be very clear. I am not a mechanic. I do handy man work on the side, but i am not a vehicle service tech. 

HOWEVER, I do have common sense and do understand how an AC works.
Whether that be a compressor or an evaporating coil, OR an example would be (if i worked on your hot water heater, and after i say "" it's fixed "" and leave. You notice you now you have a leak coming from the water heater. 

More than likely, it probably was due to me not doing something correctly... With me so far? Lol
So,
You had an issue that was not working, I ""repaired"" it, left, and it is no longer working properly. (Even more than the original issue)

More than likely, it would be due to whatever service was done. Whether that be a car, a home, or anything. Now, i was unable to leave my car at the dealership for OVER a WEEK. AGAIN!
I have to arrange my schedule and blah blah blah.

Finally get the car in the shop. 
A couple of days later, I get a call saying my evaporator coil has a ""pine whole"" leak, and this is why you are experiencing warm air on the driver's side of the vehicle, and cold air on the passenger side. 

Now, at the time of the replacement of the engine, I was still under a warranty that would be able to fix and cover the evaporator coil. All of a sudden, now, i finally get the car back in the shop, and my warranty expired. 
A MONTH  AGO!? 

My service representative went ahead and contacted corporate, and wanted to see if they would be able to do something to work with me sense It had only expired a month ago. Initially, the cost for this fix is around $3,700.

They responded with being able to take care of $2,850, and i would have to pay the remainder, which is $850.

Well, not only do I not have $850 to go ahead and fix an issue that I did not have prior to the vehicle being worked on, I also stated , that while the engine was being replaced, The warranty it was active!!!

So in my mind, that tells me that because the issue had happened while under warranty, and I also had contacted the dealership while it was still under warranty. We shouldn't have an issue with the coverage.

It should be covered regardless now. I may be wrong about that. That's just how I look at things. (Also, im not an attorney) But I'd like to revert back to my story about the hot water tank.

Servicing your hot water tank. Now, when I do something like that, there is no warranty, okay? Regardless of if there was a warranty or not, that homeowner would immediately
Get in touch with me, explain the situation, and expect me to fix it. 

Which I would because if it's not done right, it's not done right or if I had done something wrong. I had done something wrong, and It needs to be fixed properly. 

That's just how I was brought up, but I also thought that is the right way to conduct business. 

So now I'm in a little bit of a dilemma. 
I'm not sure how to go about this issue.

Since both compressors have made this noise, it is time for you to look elsewhere for the source.  Compressors gobble up a lot of horsepower and they don't do so in a smooth fashion, especially compressors like that R-4.  Those two things can cause marginal components in your accessory drive system to misbehave when it is running.

If it has an automatic belt tensioner, I'd check that to see if it is moving around excessively when the compressor is on.  If that looks good, I'd pull the belt and give each and every pulley a good wiggle and a good spin.  None should wiggle more than a fraction of a millimeter and they should all spin smoothly and quietly.

I have a 2010 Toyota aurion that I've had a weird electrical issue with for the last couple of years. 
Normally only happens when it's cold but not always, sometimes I'd be driving along fine then turn on my high beams which would cause it to drop any/all radio, air con and cluster for a split second or so. Sometimes I'd drive completely fine to work, jump in after work and the air con would be in default setting like I'd lost power, and once or twice the clock was reset. 
I've now had 2 issues where the car wouldn't start, once I had been driving it fine then it refused to start again, acting like a flat battery. 
Now today, after multiple days of random issues like the above, my car refuses to start. 
Battery is fine, I've checked it and everything electrical works no worries (cluster, radio, air con etc), strangely the keyless door unlock didn't work, and it takes a second after the brake pedal is pushed for the push start light to turn on, and it acts like a dead battery, weak flicker on start, engine not turning at all, and sometimes but not always that little ticking noise. 
Now to me that sounds like a flat battery or dodgy starter but considering the above issues I'm thinking it's a dodgy earth or something similar but I can't seem to find it (I'm not great with electricals).

Previous owner (a coworker) did it once, and I was able to replicate it once by mistake on a wet ground

But recently the car sat for a while, this caused it to lose battery charge and I assume theres some gunk thats holding up a solenoid somewhere that supposed to allow it to shift back to first gear on idle.

When trying to move from a stop, I can tell its starting from 2nd gear as the revs no longer dip around 13mph as thats typically the point when the 1st gear (low) is done pushing the car forward and shifts to 2nd. 

Instead, you'll get a high rev followed by a VERY death slow movement of the car until the rev limiter hits 3k. and then it goes to 3rd and then overdrive as I have gauged it out over prolonged use. My mechanic changed the fluid which he said was very dirty, he also changed the filter.

Now it stopped shifting back to 1st all together. 1st usually switched the tachometer reset the tachometer RPM at 2100 around 15mph. but now it just RAMPS up to 3rd on one tachometer pull up to 3000 if that makes sense

1m8m3wr,2003 Civic Overheating Issues,"Hey all, need some advice. 

Car Information: 2003 Honda Civic EX, 4 Door Sedan, Front-Wheel Drive, 1.7L L4 Gas


I‚Äôve been driving my manual civic for about 10 years now and it‚Äôs at ~190k miles. The past few weeks, I‚Äôve been having heating issues and while I‚Äôve fixed a few of the issues, the engine keeps overheating. 

 At first, I figured it was a radiator issue, since the initial problem came when the upper overflow tube snapped and started spraying coolant in the engine bay. I replaced the radiator myself, and discovered the radiator fan had melted as well and its fuse was blown, so I replaced those too.

Now, the fans work, but the engine starts overheating almost immediately when I start it up, but here‚Äôs the kicker, the engine temp gauge isn‚Äôt reacting to the engine‚Äôs heat. Seems to take a while to start pushing liquid through? Other thing here is, the car overheats quicker on the road when I turn the AC on?

When I bleed the coolant, there seems to be bubbling for longer than is reasonable, and some of the liquid in the coolant funnel looks greasy. 

So I‚Äôm thinking, is this a head gasket? I‚Äôm leaning towards gasket, but wanted to get some outsider opinions. 

I‚Äôve done some repairs on it, but this seems like it‚Äôll be a bit tougher than other small things here and there. Should I try repairing it, or is it too much of a hassle?

Just looking for advice, and some laughs at the melted fan lol.

I worked on a Chevy today and I had to clean the throttle body to fix a random misfire. Most V6 Chevys, if yours is a V6, have a rough idle because of the way the engine is designed. Think of a high performance camshaft blub blub blub. If it runs well off idle I wouldn't worry about it too much. Chevys are known for having lifter issues like many single cam v engines. When a lifter goes bad it's very obvious, so probably not that.

When I got the van back this second time, the A/C once again was not working - i checked at home and the pressure was reading low, so I did a quick leak stopper and recharge, and that got things working fine again - it was good for about 3-4 weeks.

I‚Äôll mention there are no warning lights on the dash as well. 

This is a trustworthy mechanic we‚Äôve used successfully for a long time, so I‚Äôm guessing something deeper got missed that we have to take back, however I‚Äôd like to see if I can get this A/C running since the vehicle wont be seen for a bit, and it‚Äôs real hot out this weekend lol.

For eyeball measurements, remember that the backing plate of the pad is almost universally 5mm thick. Most manufacturers will say replacement is due when the pad material is around 2mm. So, when you eyeball measure, compare the thickness of the pad material vs the thickness of the backing plate, and if it looks like the material is about half, then it's probably time.

Most inspection software I've seen at the dealer level will start requiring a recommendation be made when you put in a measurement of 5mm or less.

At the end of the day, brakes are just regular maintenance. In this modern age, new pads and rotors are the standard, even if slightly wasteful/overkill. This is because rotors are thinner than they used to be (for cost and weight savings), so they don‚Äôt reliably last as long.

Its also possible its an unused wire. Sometimes there are different versions of the same exact model for that year and sometimes there are differences in where they were manufactured. Meaning it may be an extra on some and used on others. Dont ignore the wire though. It may be needed. If you dont have access to old compressor check with dealer to look up oem compressor.

1m8iuui,"My car was ATTEMPTED stolen, I need advice.","Hey guys, so I have a 2024 Kia Forte and this morning I was on my way to work. when I arrived at my car I noticed the trunk was open. I thought I may have accidentally did it myself so I closed it. When I got to the driver side door and opened it, I saw glass was shattered on the front passenger side along with my steering wheel column being ripped open exposing the ignition. I realized I was ""Kia Boyed"". If you aren't familiar with this phrase, its a term used when a Kia or Hyundai is stolen or attached stolen thanks to this social media trend of young dudes stealing Kia's. Kia had a flaw that these morons took advantage of. My car is a newer model of course, so it has an immobilizer which was added to prevent theft of the car. They just started making newer kia's with this addition to stop the thefts. Older models have a recall on them offering free computer system updates (if it's still available) to prevent theft. I am stupid because I had this happen to my last Kia which was a 2016 Kia Optima but thank god my battery was dying so they couldn't take that one. Here I am AGAIN going through the same BS. I'm so stupid to have bought another Kia and I hate myself so much for doing so. But this was the only car the bank would agree to give me that was affordable and within my budget so I took the risk stupidly. I hate myself for buying it. I bought a good steering wheel lock with an alarm on it today and I am thinking Abt buying a Faraday box and pouch from Amazon. Do any of you have any advice on these products and what I should buy to protect my car? I plan on trading it in once my insurance pays to fix it. I can't continue dealing with this.

1m8gdah,Code P2271,"Hi guys, this car has a P2271 code and I don‚Äôt know how to fix it. Chassis miles: 219k

What‚Äôs done to it so far:

- Fixed P2646, P0011 with basic maintenance (oil change, coolant refill, etc.)

- Replaced O2 Sensor-Denso 234-4797 (downstream because that was where the code was) 

- Changed air/cabin filter

- Got the flex pipe rewelded (thought that could‚Äôve been the cause because unnecessary air)

I‚Äôm thinking about putting Cataclean in my catalytic converter since i‚Äôm not getting a P0420 code, which indicates below catalytic efficiency. I assume the catalytic converter is just dirty and not ready for replacement.

If my hypothesis is wrong please correct/guide me to a better solution. I am 20, this is my first car, and I‚Äôm in college. Trying my best to be knowledgeable for my own sake. Thanks!

I wet sanded down the deep scratches, and filled them. Easy peasy. Then came the paint pen. The results were not good, it was clumpy, textured, and much darker than my vehicle.

You might not believe me but it looks better now than it did with the paint. 

Now my vehicle looks like the pictures. 
How do I salvage this (other than calling in a pro and paying a lot of money)? 
Do I sand it down more and in a larger area, tape it off, and buy an OEM aerosol kit with the color coat and clear coat, and see if I have any skill with spray paint? Is doubling/tripling down a bad idea at this point?

My engine was replaced and covered due to a warranty. I finally get my car back after 3+ weeks. (Im so happy!). We'll it didn't last.

As soon as I get into my car, I turn the AC on, (it typically takes about 5 mins to start to feel COLD if vehilce is in direct sunlight and idelling.) Once I started driving, typically that helps the compressor a lot with the AC from the power and the engine. But i couldn't help noticing an issue with the AC RIGHT AWAY!
I mean, right off the dealerships lot. 
I picked the car up late so the service department was closed so I called the following day.
The first thing the gentleman said to me was, ""How do you know it was due to the replacement of the engine?"" 

Now, I want to be very clear. I am not a mechanic. I do handy man work on the side, but i am not a vehicle service tech. 

HOWEVER, I do have common sense and do understand how an AC works.
Whether that be a compressor or an evaporating coil, OR an example would be (if i worked on your hot water heater, and after i say "" it's fixed "" and leave. You notice you now you have a leak coming from the water heater. 

More than likely, it probably was due to me not doing something correctly... With me so far? Lol
So,
You had an issue that was not working, I ""repaired"" it, left, and it is no longer working properly. (Even more than the original issue)

More than likely, it would be due to whatever service was done. Whether that be a car, a home, or anything. Now, i was unable to leave my car at the dealership for OVER a WEEK. AGAIN!
I have to arrange my schedule and blah blah blah.

Finally get the car in the shop. 
A couple of days later, I get a call saying my evaporator coil has a ""pine whole"" leak, and this is why you are experiencing warm air on the driver's side of the vehicle, and cold air on the passenger side. 

Now, at the time of the replacement of the engine, I was still under a warranty that would be able to fix and cover the evaporator coil. All of a sudden, now, i finally get the car back in the shop, and my warranty expired. 
A MONTH  AGO!? 

My service representative went ahead and contacted corporate, and wanted to see if they would be able to do something to work with me sense It had only expired a month ago. Initially, the cost for this fix is around $3,700.

They responded with being able to take care of $2,850, and i would have to pay the remainder, which is $850.

Well, not only do I not have $850 to go ahead and fix an issue that I did not have prior to the vehicle being worked on, I also stated , that while the engine was being replaced, The warranty it was active!!!

So in my mind, that tells me that because the issue had happened while under warranty, and I also had contacted the dealership while it was still under warranty. We shouldn't have an issue with the coverage.

It should be covered regardless now. I may be wrong about that. That's just how I look at things. (Also, im not an attorney) But I'd like to revert back to my story about the hot water tank.

Servicing your hot water tank. Now, when I do something like that, there is no warranty, okay? Regardless of if there was a warranty or not, that homeowner would immediately
Get in touch with me, explain the situation, and expect me to fix it. 

Which I would because if it's not done right, it's not done right or if I had done something wrong. I had done something wrong, and It needs to be fixed properly. 

That's just how I was brought up, but I also thought that is the right way to conduct business. 

So now I'm in a little bit of a dilemma. 
I'm not sure how to go about this issue.

A leak anywhere affects the entire system. If you vehicle uses multiple evaporators ,it might be possible that there is a low volume of refrigerant and the dealer is using a leak diagnosis to recover the difference of a warranty engine replacement and retail replacement.

1m8u7ce,How awful of a desicion is this?,"Ive come across the opportunity to buy a pristine V6 05 auto mustang. 125k on it, asking 4.2k firm. Its has almost 0 rust and has been well taken care of. New rims/tires a little under a year ago, some exhaust work done aswell and it sounds great. I took it for a test drive and it runs beautifully. The AC blows weak and the passenger door only opens from the inside, these are the only known flaws. Recently had new cats and alternator aswell. The guy selling it is a pretty close family friend, I know he dosent have any ill will.

I currently have a 98 accord EX with about 200k on it. It currently runs without major issues, no oil burning/leaking, shifts well. Has about $400-$500 in minor repairs it needs, AC/heat need work, broken head unit and timing belts are about due. I can replace these myself, I have experience with mechanical work and currently am in school working towards ASE certifications.


I know id be losing some reliability and MPG but really how bad of a desicion is it? Im fine with losing a little monetary value to really love what I drive. What im really looking for is something that would last me at least another 75-100k miles without a blown engine/trans. Is it worth it to put 15+ hours and $500 into the accord rather than just getting cash for it and buying something without these issues?

1m8ktcj,Mysterious Intermittent Brake Noise - Seeking Advice/Ideas,"Hi everyone, I'm hoping to get some thoughts or ideas on a very frustrating and confusing brake noise I'm experiencing with my car, as I'm getting conflicting information and can't pinpoint it. I want to keep this car running as long as possible, so getting this resolved is important. **Car:** 2005 Ford Five Hundred **The Problem:** I'm hearing a loud, harsh noise from the front brake area when I'm pressing or sometimes releasing the brake pedal. The sound is best described as grinding, crackling, or screeching (like ""teeth grinding""). It's highly intermittent ‚Äì it doesn't happen every time I brake, but can occur multiple times during a trip (when pulling out of the parking lot, or multiple times on a commute). It seems to happen whenever it wants to. **Crucial Timeline/Context:** This is a NEW noise; it was not present when I first got the car a couple of years ago. It specifically started/became noticeable AFTER my stabilizer links were recently replaced. I initially thought it was related to them, but now realize it's a distinct brake noise. **What I've Done So Far:** First, I took it to **Shop #1, where they** ***did*** **hear the noise**, but told me it was ""normal"" due to ""pressure"" and wouldn't go away. This didn't sound right to me. Then, I just had a free brake inspection at **Shop #2**. The technician said the brake pads look good (plenty of material), and they checked calipers and other components. They drove it, even tried hard braking, but **could not reproduce or hear the noise** themselves. They said it's ""safe"" and to bring it back if it gets worse so they can pinpoint it. **My Confusion:** I'm confused because I clearly hear this concerning grinding/crackling noise, one shop *heard it* but called it ""normal,"" and the other shop *couldn't hear it at all* during their check. **Seeking Your Input:** Has anyone experienced a similar intermittent grinding/crackling/screeching brake noise that mechanics struggled to diagnose or that was dismissed as ""normal""? What could be causing this type of noise if the pads look good and it's so intermittent? Any ideas on why it's so hard to pinpoint, or what additional information I should be gathering if it continues? Any advice or shared experiences would be incredibly helpful as I try to get this figured out for my car's longevity and my family's safety.

A car with an automatic transmission is always trying to move forward, even when you have your foot on the brake. As you let off the brake, the pressure on the pads gets low enough, they slip, and depending on quite a few factors (tempature of brakes, rotor surface, pad surface, pad material and other such), they will have the brake rotors dragged along them by the engine.



This will only happen at very low speed (like slower than walking pace).



I've personally noticed that cheaper semi-metallic brake pads get especially loud as they age.


The best way to reduce the noise is to be more aggressive with the pedal and not creeping forward with your foot on the brake.


The first shop was right. This is normal.


The second shop probably did hear it, but the technician told the service advisor that they didn't hear anything because, to someone who works on cars daily, its a completely expected sound.


In my opinion, the quietest pads are ceramic material based, although those require rotors designed for them.

1m8oyqo,Not sure what to do??,"So, I'm going through this currently. 
My engine was replaced and covered due to a warranty. I finally get my car back after 3+ weeks. (Im so happy!). We'll it didn't last.

As soon as I get into my car, I turn the AC on, (it typically takes about 5 mins to start to feel COLD if vehilce is in direct sunlight and idelling.) Once I started driving, typically that helps the compressor a lot with the AC from the power and the engine. But i couldn't help noticing an issue with the AC RIGHT AWAY!
I mean, right off the dealerships lot. 
I picked the car up late so the service department was closed so I called the following day.
The first thing the gentleman said to me was, ""How do you know it was due to the replacement of the engine?"" 

Now, I want to be very clear. I am not a mechanic. I do handy man work on the side, but i am not a vehicle service tech. 

HOWEVER, I do have common sense and do understand how an AC works.
Whether that be a compressor or an evaporating coil, OR an example would be (if i worked on your hot water heater, and after i say "" it's fixed "" and leave. You notice you now you have a leak coming from the water heater. 

More than likely, it probably was due to me not doing something correctly... With me so far? Lol
So,
You had an issue that was not working, I ""repaired"" it, left, and it is no longer working properly. (Even more than the original issue)

More than likely, it would be due to whatever service was done. Whether that be a car, a home, or anything. Now, i was unable to leave my car at the dealership for OVER a WEEK. AGAIN!
I have to arrange my schedule and blah blah blah.

Finally get the car in the shop. 
A couple of days later, I get a call saying my evaporator coil has a ""pine whole"" leak, and this is why you are experiencing warm air on the driver's side of the vehicle, and cold air on the passenger side. 

Now, at the time of the replacement of the engine, I was still under a warranty that would be able to fix and cover the evaporator coil. All of a sudden, now, i finally get the car back in the shop, and my warranty expired. 
A MONTH  AGO!? 

My service representative went ahead and contacted corporate, and wanted to see if they would be able to do something to work with me sense It had only expired a month ago. Initially, the cost for this fix is around $3,700.

They responded with being able to take care of $2,850, and i would have to pay the remainder, which is $850.

Well, not only do I not have $850 to go ahead and fix an issue that I did not have prior to the vehicle being worked on, I also stated , that while the engine was being replaced, The warranty it was active!!!

So in my mind, that tells me that because the issue had happened while under warranty, and I also had contacted the dealership while it was still under warranty. We shouldn't have an issue with the coverage.

It should be covered regardless now. I may be wrong about that. That's just how I look at things. (Also, im not an attorney) But I'd like to revert back to my story about the hot water tank.

Servicing your hot water tank. Now, when I do something like that, there is no warranty, okay? Regardless of if there was a warranty or not, that homeowner would immediately
Get in touch with me, explain the situation, and expect me to fix it. 

Which I would because if it's not done right, it's not done right or if I had done something wrong. I had done something wrong, and It needs to be fixed properly. 

That's just how I was brought up, but I also thought that is the right way to conduct business. 

So now I'm in a little bit of a dilemma. 
I'm not sure how to go about this issue. If anyone has any sort of information, even if I am incorrect about my opinion, please feel free to leave a comment explaining why?

1m8tjmb,Can autonomous vehicles solve the tourism infrastructure problem?,"I was reading about how Saudi Arabia is using autonomous vehicles in cities like Riyadh and AlUla, and it honestly seems like a smart move. They're using self-driving shuttles, Robotaxis, and even autonomous street sweepers in busy public spaces.

A company called WeRide is behind a lot of it. Their Robotaxis are supposed to launch on Uber later this year, and their shuttle buses are already running in places like medical centers, tourist areas, and residential zones. It's part of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 plan to modernize transportation and support the country's growing tourism industry.

Tourism there is expected to bring in over 100 billion dollars by 2033. Instead of waiting to build out more traditional infrastructure, they're using AVs to connect people between metro stations, hotels, parks, and other key spots. In a hot climate where walking long distances isn't ideal, this setup actually solves real problems.

It reminds me of what companies like Waymo, Cruise, and Tesla have been trying to do in the US, though the rollout there feels slower with more red tape. NVIDIA is also involved in powering a lot of these vehicles globally, including the ones WeRide is deploying. Seeing this kind of integration already happening in the Middle East makes me wonder where we'll see real adoption next.

One brand I worked for had a partnership with castrol and thats what we could order through our normal parts ordering system. We were allowed to buy other brands of oil from other places if we wanted to, but if we provide invoices to the manufacturer that we were using castrol they would subsidize part of that expense. I used a local supplier for castrol and because I was ordering so much they offered us things like the paper floor mats and plastic seat covers and other consumables for free. As for things like gear oil or transmission fluid, dealerships are typically going to get it from their manufacturer and not a 3rd party. 

When it comes to the independent/aftermarket world, most shops have deals in place with their vendors they already order the rest of the parts with and typically ordering specified amounts of oil opens them up for incentives. When it comes to transmission fluid, most independent shops are ordering from the dealer because the fluids aren't just basic Trans fluid anymore. As for gear oil, grease etc I have no idea. 

My opinion as someone who's managed shops of different sizes from corporate dealerships to hole in the wall mom and pop shops, I would expect it to be more beneficial to look into supplying the parts stores rather than trying to make deals with individual shops."

Regardless, even with the transmission issue, he says the car would still be good for 100,000 miles. If the spark plugs were not the solution, he suggested bringing it in to price a filter replacement and fluid change.

1m8jlwx,Noise  and stalling intermittently,"2016 Kia Forte- 1.8l engine

Hi there! I was just hoping to get maybe some suggestions. My car started making a noise back in late March.  By beginning of April, the noise was still intermittent, but was happening more often.  It stalled on me pulling into a parking lot on two different occasions. We ended up changing the alternator. I was able to drive somewhere 30 minutes away with no noise (which could be a coincidence) and after I left a few hours later, the noise happened again. I was halfway through my drive home and right before I started to make my turn down the main road, the car cut off completely. The previous times it cut off, it turned on immediately after. This time I had to have someone come and jump me. 

I then took it to the most recommended shop in town and they suggested a new alternator as the one that was put on was remanufactured and that they couldn‚Äôt replicate the noise I‚Äôm hearing. After getting the new alternator, the problem is still happening. I‚Äôve been without a car since and am at a complete loss. Anyone have any suggestions?

You‚Äôll quickly run into issues getting the engine connected to the wheels though. Forklifts have low gears meant for high torque at low speeds, so your hemi power isn‚Äôt going to do anything but spin wildly when you rev it up. You‚Äôd need some pretty serious custom made drivetrain pieces to get a transmission with enough range for racing attached to a differential with a drive ratio high enough you up to speed. 

Of course, then there‚Äôs the weight. And the fact that they‚Äôre front wheel drive with the weight all over the back wheels. A normal factory floor style forklift with a 8000lb capacity weighs around 12,000lbs. Even a  600hp crate won‚Äôt make that a fast truck, it‚Äôll do plenty of burnouts but that thing isn‚Äôt going to accelerate worth a damn.

It is important to note that this noise is intermittent and I have heard it while  accelerating and breaking. It is also NOT dependant on me turning one direction or another. I also hear it while not utilizing A/C, Heat, or any other switches in the car. This noise was not present prior to getting my vehicle back from the reputable repair shop. The car drives great. I have driven around 1000 miles since receiving the vehicle back. I managed to capture the noise on this video beginning at around the 8 second mark and it last a few seconds. You should notice a winding/grr sound. Any suggestions would be appreciated as this is truly bizarre. All my diagnostics from GMC come back normal.

For this reason it is typical for most shops to recommend rotors at the same time as pads. If a rotor is in good enough condition to be turned, the labor to turn the rotor may approach the cost of the replacement.

Since yesterday evening, I‚Äôve noticed a strange grinding or rattling noise coming from underneath my car ‚Äì most noticeable when rolling in reverse without throttle. Sometimes it also occurs when rolling forward slowly.

Please note:
There‚Äôs a single loud ‚Äúclunk‚Äù in the video ‚Äì I believe this is just the brakes reacting to the change in direction and not what I‚Äôm referring to.

What I mean is the grinding/rattling noise that follows while rolling. It sounds metallic and irregular, like something is vibrating or dragging slightly.

MonsieurReynard (Score: 1): It‚Äôs summer. Are you running AC a lot? Maybe letting the car idle a while until the AC cools it down?  That will definitely ding your fuel mileage. 

Check your tire inflation.  Probably the most common cause of changes in fuel mileage.

Those range/fuel mileage displays on your dashboard are inaccurate, always. They calculate your remaining range based on the mileage of your last tank of gas and most recent drive.  So you could fill up and drive on the highway for four hours to a big city. Then fill it in the city, and the range will show ‚Äú420 miles‚Äù or whatever. But then you spend the next day driving around the city in stop and go traffic and you‚Äôll get half that range.  Then you fill it to go home and the dashboard will say you have only 270 miles of range. But then you drive home at 65mph on the highway and actually get 380 miles.  

It‚Äôs a lagging indicator, not a real time estimate.  The computer is guessing you‚Äôll keep driving the same way in the same conditions as your last tank of gas. 

The only way to assess your fuel mileage properly is to manually measure it. Fill up, noting exactly how much gas it took to get to the first ‚Äúclick‚Äù stop on the pump (and no more!), and note your exact mileage, check the tires, remove excess weight, set the trip odometer  to zero, and go drive a couple hours on the highway at normal speeds but trying  to keep it steady at 60 or 65 at most. (The EPA doesn‚Äôt speed.) 

Close the windows and run the AC on recirc. Try to find a level stretch of 50-100 miles with minimal grade changes. Don‚Äôt pass people, just keep it as steady as you can.  Ideally you‚Äôd choose a day that isn‚Äôt too windy. 

Set the cruise control whenever you can to hold speed. 

Then fill it again exactly to the first click and divide the number on your trip odometer by exactly how much gas you had to put in. Ideally you‚Äôd repeat this a couple times but once should be enough to get a good reading. 

If you‚Äôre seeing something even close to the EPA highway mileage estimate after doing this all is fine. And whatever fuel consumption variation you‚Äôre noticing is down to driving conditions and your own right foot. 


The dashboard  gauges are basically guesswork estimates.  You have to get the real number."

My partner‚Äôs 2016 Corolla had been sitting for a little while (stopped driving due to health stuff) but had no major mechanical issues going on (or smells). Getting ready to sell it, I jumped it and drove it around for a few days, cleaned it up, it was running just fine. I took it in for inspection, got some basic brake work done as well as a new battery and oil change. It was all good when I drove it home but next time I started it, I noticed the sulfur/rotten egg smell INSIDE the car which progressively got worse, though I only drove it a few miles since getting the work done. 

So I brought it back into the shop, noting to the guys that I thought it may have to do with the new battery or new oil filter. I assumed it would be an obvious and easy fix, but they told me they found no problems and quoted me $100 for a cabin air filter replacement.

I picked the car up, replaced the cabin filter myself and had the battery tested at autozone. Would that have even picked up a defective battery? How could I tell if the battery is in a condition that would cause the smell? 

Another shop I talked to were also dumbfounded about the smell and seemed focused on the catalytic converter. Obviously that‚Äôs not a repair I want to pay for, but I also just think with the distinct timing, it‚Äôs most likely the battery, right?

I have a mk7 VW Golf 1.8T close to 150,000 km. The AC is having trouble maintaining interior temperature when ambient temperature is above 35 Celsius or 95F. Below this threshold, the AC can eventually make the cabin quite cold.

Vents blow strongly, cabin air filter less than a year old and relatively clean, and refrigerant pressure is within normal range.

I took some pics of what I think is the condenser. Does it look like it could be damaged or worned enough to be the problem?

1m9abc4,General advice for what you guys would do in my situation.,"I think I just need some suggestions if that's okay. I currently have a 2017 Hyundai i30 that needs a new turbo charger. The hyundai garage quoted me ¬£2,700 all in all. I can't afford it nor can I justify it. The car is on finance for ¬£219 a month, and I'm still paying ¬£250 instalments monthly for a new ABS it needed 4 months ago.

I have a garage willing to order in a Garrat turbocharger used for Kia and Hyundai cars, with the same model number matching my one. This garage is the only one who will touch it, and seem confident in doing so despite never having fitted a turbo on my make and model hyundai before. 

The hyundai engineer at the hyundai garage mentioned that there's no reason why a local garage couldn't do the job, which is why I've chosen this option as I'm saving about ¬£1.500. 

The only concern I have is if the guy can do it perfectly, as I understand this kind of operation is really hard to do for my car and needs to be tuned perfectly to everything else. They say they have the machine to do it but I genuinely don't feel like they know what to expect here. 

The car is a curse honestly and I'm really depressed atm. I just want a car that makes me happy. Something nice, reliable, and to treat myself to something fancy like an older model C class Mercedes or something. 

I know it sounds stupid and I should just get something reliable like a skoda or something, but I'm almost 30 and just want to treat myself a little. I'd be willing to get whatever car on finance for around 250-300pm.

Depending on where you are at in the lifecycle of the finance deal - you might be in trouble.

Please be aware that if you do not get the car fixed, you are massively reducing the market rate. This in turn runs the risk of negative equity on your finance arrangement. Theoretically you could hand the car back in early and still be paying out on it because you returned a car which didn't pay off the remainder of the finance.

Finance company may allow you to do this and they will extend outwards a payment period to cover a new car. However this now means you are in long term servitude to a finance payment.

This can be a very nasty cycle for someone to be caught out in.

Get the numbers right.

Establish the ""working order"" market value of your car.  
Establish the ""not fixed"" market value of your car.  
Establish the outstanding finance.  
Look at the gap.  
Compare it to the repair charge.  
Make a call about whether or not you can pull this off.

I'd also consider a call to your finance company explaining the situation and seeing what they can offer.

You only have 1 immediate choice to make  
\- fix it or don't

My personal advice would be this.

Take the hit, get the car fixed. Ride it out for a while and start saving up money and building a credit rating. If you can reach the end of your finance terms, get a nicer car that's newer and under manufacturer warranty so you don't have to deal with shit again. Put a larger deposit down. Get a bank loan if you can get a competitive APR. Even if you don't want to do the loan, it's still good to show up with a quote that forces the dealership to compete for your money.

An old C Class is a cool idea, but you could easily find yourself in this scenario again. Some shit goes wrong, it costs a lot to repair and one problem reveals another.

The thing that people don't warn you about with car ownership is that you need to be able to accept liability for losing the entire value of the car should things go mechnically wrong. Warranties on more expensive cars are a really good means to protect yourself a bit from the financial strain of unexpected multiple thousand pound bills.

As far trusting the garage goes. Look, you need to do your homework. There will always be bad reviews on google - it's just the law. But try see the overall flow of reviews. At a certain point I don't think you will be able to do anything other than make a decision based on how your spreadsheets look.

If you need to go down the cut your losses route. Make sure you understand the consequences fully and are okay with it. This shit happened to my friend recently. He's demolished 50% of the value of his car on hand in due to a fucked turbo. 

He's now riding around in a beater car that is honestly 1 failure away from the grave while he rides out the final year of his finance.

1m98n8m,Is buying a new Mercedes A class AMG reasonable?,"I‚Äôve been looking into the A class AMG and it seems like a very good deal, specifically currently, Mercedes are running a promotion for ¬£7,000 off and very good apr, 4.12%. The cars value is ¬£41,585.00. I‚Äôd be looking to put down a ¬£7,000 deposit bringing the monthly cost to ¬£370.45. The balloon payment is ¬£21,475.00. Which I think I‚Äôd aim to pay however I can‚Äôt exactly know as that would be 4 years down the line. 

For me this car seems great, I‚Äôve watched a lot of content on it and it looks like a decent daily in comfort mode that can be switched to a fun sports car in sport+ mode. It‚Äôs also DCT which would to me is desirable with where I live as it can congest with traffic from time to time, so would provide a slightly easier drive. Not congested enough though to the point a car like this can‚Äôt be enjoyed, or at least not at the times I would drive it at, as I work very early mornings or late at night. 

I‚Äôve been told to get a cheap runaround but I don‚Äôt really get the point, maybe I‚Äôm painfully naive. I don‚Äôt want to buy a car as a runaround, I have access to my parents‚Äô car and while it can be annoying to share this is really all I need if I‚Äôm not buying to enjoy. For me I see it 2 ways, I stay in the car I‚Äôm in, which is cheap and reliable (for now) or I get a new car which wouldn‚Äôt be cheap but would give me freedom to go wherever and own my own car. It‚Äôs mostly ‚Äòfor fun‚Äô but also this car has practical use from what I can see, a boot that is big enough for anything I‚Äôd need to carry, has 5 seats so I can bundle my whole family in (not children, I mean parents/ siblings). 

A big selling point for me also is the technology, I know this isn‚Äôt the only car out there with a built in sat nav, reversing camera or any of the other assists. But if I‚Äôm to buy any car I want at the very least a reversing camera and sat nav, purely because I‚Äôd rather have them than not have them. I can drive and park perfectly fine, but they‚Äôre assists I want to look for in a new car. I‚Äôm aware there are cheap runarounds even with this tech in, but I‚Äôm back to spending what I‚Äôd still consider a lot of money on something I ultimately don‚Äôt want. 

Insurance will definitely be costly, I reckon for the first 2 years at least, maybe looking at ¬£200 cheapest and ¬£300 on the higher side, monthly that is of course. This is doable for me, I am paid well for what I do, live at home and pay minimal rent. My essential outgoings as of currently are around ¬£350, ¬£100 of which is my current car insurance. Even in a bad month of work I‚Äôd be left with excess ¬£1000 after the car payment, insurance and rent. I‚Äôm not sure how would fuel would cost to be totally honest, but even setting aside ¬£200 (not sure if that‚Äôs conservative or not enough at all) still leaves me with a good 800+ every month. 

So, I think financially I can make it happen, but the big question is, is it really worth it? I‚Äôm not very experienced in all this, so I‚Äôd appreciate insight, are there costs I‚Äôve completely missed and will be a wet slap in the face? Is a new Mercedes reliable enough that I don‚Äôt need to worry about mechanical costs for at least a year (providing I don‚Äôt drive crazy, which I won‚Äôt, I want it to last)? Also, is anyone aware of how often, if at all, Mercedes run these sorts of discounts? I‚Äôve never been in the market for a new car so I‚Äôm unsure, as this could also sway my decision to hold out until next year with a lot more saved or going for a higher spec/ model. 

Just like to say thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this and give any help/ advice/ opinions. If more info is needed for anything I‚Äôm sure I can provide!

And it's a spectrum, of varying priorities and financial situations.

Some folk will spend 20k on a car, then look back and think ""that was a waste I should have spent 5k on a jalopy"". Others will spend 20k and be delighted with the experience.

This subreddit oddly enough seems to be full of folks for whom a car is mostly just transport. And thus the general outlook is buying a cheap old jalopy with cash and finance nothing. Which is unlike most typical car groups, which are often full of the more enthusiast types.

I've driven exclusively diesel cars since I passed my test and have recently switched to a petrol (2019 1.5t Civic).

When lifting the clutch to the bite I get a juddering, is this normal? I've only recently bought the car so am still under warranty but it just doesn't feel right. If I lift the RPMs to around 1000 it's fine, but coming from diesels where the bite is thick and the car just moves off on the clutch alone i'm wondering if this is normal?

You could just be lugging the engine. Diesel engines have a lot more torque at lower revs. They're great for learners as they are harder to stall.

Many take a while to adjust  going from a diesel learner car to petrol. I certainly did. 

So either you need to get used to giving it a few revs (1000rpm would be totally normal for my Honda), raise the clutch more slowly or you do in fact have an issue.

Maybe go to somewhere flat. See if you can get the car to move without juddering by raising the clutch as slowly as possible. Like you probably did on your first driving lesson. If you can go it then it's probably you needing to get used to giving it more revs than a car issue.

Alternatively get someone else more experienced to give it a go and see if they thing it's unusual.

On a serious note, since it‚Äôs been 8 months then the onus is on you to prove that the fault was there since purchase if you expect to have any kind of recourse legally.

You could ask the dealer again to take a look but wouldn‚Äôt expect much in the way of free repairs unless you can prove there was an issue with the turbo from the moment you purchased it

Agree that when you spend that kind of money it‚Äôs a bit shit for it to go wrong but cars are complex machines and stuff can go wrong at any time! Especially in a Qashqai!

Anyway, who finds this interesting? I stopped using E10 in my cars as I had noticed a high fuel consumption than with using E5. On my previous car 5 years ago, I noticed that while I was still using E10, my car would stall and cut out whole negotiating a roundabout, it hadn‚Äôt clicked for me back then, but when I started using E5, the stalling and cut outs stopped. I know some people use E10 cause it is cheaper, but is saving a few quid really better than getting the premium petrol?
